I live at Old-Ford : Last Saturday four weeks, I lost an iron crow, a pick-axe, and sundry iron, out of my yard; the prisoner was stopped by the patrol with the property.
I am a patrol: On Saturday night, the 23d of January, I met the prisoner, with some iron on his shoulder, between ten and eleven o'clock at night; he had also a crow and a pick-axe; I met him just by the weigh-bridge, in Mile-end-road; I asked him what he had got upon his shoulder, he said, he had got some old iron that he had collected from different places, and he told me he had been breaking up some old shipping, at Blackwall; that was about a mile from Mr. Green's premises. (Produces the property.)
I know these to be my property; they are certainly mine.
I was at the stopping of the prisoner; these are the things that we found upon him.
I found them in the road, God is my witness.
When did you miss these things?
The same night.
