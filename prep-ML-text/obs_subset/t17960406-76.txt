I am the wife of James Jones , I lodge in Lewkener's - lane : On Saturday, the 13th of February, I went out, and left my things safe in my box; when I returned home, I missed them; about a fortnight after, I was going past a pawnbroker's, and saw my counterpane hanging up.
I am a pawnbroker; (produces a counterpane and a coloured apron) I took in a counterpane, on Saturday the 13th of February, of the prisoner, I knew her before; she pawned that in the name of Elizabeth Davies ; and, on the 15th, of the apron, in the name of Brown. (The counterpane was deposed to by the prosecutrix).
This is not the counterpane that I pawned with this gentleman; there was a petticoat with it, the same as the gown I have got on, I sold it to him out of pawn; that is not the counterpane at all.
This is the counterpane I received from the prisoner.
