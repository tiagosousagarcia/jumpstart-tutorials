I lodge at Mr. Mitchell's house, in Rose-and-Crown row. I am a sailor . I lost all my clothes on the 18th of April: I lodged at the Thirteen Cantons, and the prisoner and I slept together. I waked about five o'clock in the morning; the prisoner was gone with all the things mentioned in the indictment (repeating them) I employed the runners to look for him; they could not find him. I went a voyage to Boston in Lincolnshire; I was gone five weeks. When I came back to Mr. Mitchell's house, the prisoner came in, and, seeing me, he turned back, and ran away; I ran after him, and catched him. He told me he would speak to me. I said I would not speak to him. When he was before the justice, he said he would make it up with me, and would pay me so much money every month.
Have you ever found any thing of your's?
No.
About half after ten o'clock in Easter week, the prisoner came into our house. The prosecutor was glad to see him, and treated him, and paid for his lodging: he had known him before. About five the next morning, the prosecutor called out, Where is Charley? and said he had been robbed.
How did the prisoner get out of your house?
He went out, and left all the doors open.
I went into this house: the girls he was in company with asked me to drink. About ten o'clock we went to bed: I got up about four in the morning, and went down to Deptford to my work, on board a Spanish prize.
What is Criger's christian-name?
John.
