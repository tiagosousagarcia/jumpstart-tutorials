I am a tailor, and keep a small shop : On the 12th of June, the prisoner took the roll of calico off the counter; I saw it in his hand when he was about ten yards from the door; I pursued him, and he threw the roll down; he run up a coach yard, where there was no thoroughfare, and was taken.
I am wife to the prosecutor; I saw the prisoner in the shop, and take the calico and walk off; he dropped it, and I picked it up.
I was going to Wapping, and coming past the shop. I heard the gentleman cry, stop thief; I ran after the man who dropped the calico, and they immediately took me, when I was running after him.
