I am a brushmaker , in Drury-lane , and a wholesale turner; the prisoner was in my service and used to go journies; he received a weekly salary, but I never authorised him to sell goods on his own account; I was present when his lodgings were searched on the 16th of October, and found two clothes brushes, a two-foot rule with a slide to it, and a bone solder, in his box, belonging to me, I believe, but cannot say positively.
You first of all took up your carman?
I did.
You never sold the prisoner any articles?
I never did.
Upon your oath, don't you know your foreman has sold him many things?
I don't know that he did.
I am a hair-dresser, in White-hart-yard, Drury-lane, and have known the prisoner about a year and an half; he told me he was rider to Mr. Morley, to whom I have delivered up some brushes, horn combs, and cases, which I purchased of the prisoner at different times; the last I bought was about nine weeks ago, and he said he had commission to sell from his master; on the Friday before he was taken up, he told me his master and he had had some words concerning some sponge, and begged I would say nothing about dealing with him, as he was going to settle in the neighbourhood; I said I would not; next day I saw Mr. Morley, and told him what I had bought of him; he said there were none of his goods, and he walked away.
The prisoner staid in his lodgings till he was taken up?
Yes, he was taken in bed.
Did you ever say you never had these things from the prisoner?
Never; I told his master first, I never dealt with the prisoner.
Did you not tell the Justice you had not those things from the prisoners?
Never; I was much alarmed, and when I had paid the value of them it was natural to be so.
You expected to be taken up?
No, I was alarmed at the scandal, although I thought he came honestly by them.
