I am a butcher , I live at No. 2, Wheeler street, Spital Fields . I saw the piece of beef go from the stall-board, I did not see who took it, I ran out and I saw the prisoner running; he fell down about an hundred yards off. I picked the beef up just by where he fell.
Are you sure it was your property.
It was such a piece of beef, I cannot swear that it was my beef.
