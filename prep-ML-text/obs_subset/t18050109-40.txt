- I live at the Golden Anchor, Saffron-hill : On the 29th of December the prisoner at the bar came into the tap-room, between six and seven in the evening; she had half a pint of beer and paid for it; I was in the taproom, she gave me a shilling to change, and asked me for a glass of gin; I went into the bar and something detained me; she came to the bar for the glass of gin and the change; I observed her right hand confined in her pocket; it was with some difficulty that she could open the street door; I went after her and felt down her petticoat, and asked her what she had got there; I found she had a gridiron; she said it was her own property; I took her back into the tap-room, and found it was my own property; I sent for an Officer, and delivered her to him.
I was in the tap-room at the time the woman was detected with the gridiron in her possession.
I am an Officer of Hatton-garden; I was sent for to take this woman into custody. (The property produced, and identified by the prosecutrix.)
I came into the gentlewoman's house for half a pint of beer; I gave her a shilling to get a drop of gin; she did not come with it, and I went to the bar to get the change of the shilling; I stood at the bar and was going back again, and how it was the gridiron was at the bar, and my apron being ragged, it caught hold of the gridiron; she put her hand to my side, and said, you have got my gridiron; I said, no, I am sure I have not, madam, and on my looking round, there was the gridiron hanging by the handle in the hole of my apron; I am a poor woman, who works in the street for my bread, and my having the liquor in my head, I did not know any thing of it; I have two small children to take care of; I work for my bread very honestly.
