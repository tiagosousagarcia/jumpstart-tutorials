I live at No. 12, Church lane ; on Thursday the 11th of this month, between four and five o'clock in the afternoon, I was at the bar of a public house opposite my house, and saw the prisoner take one of the stoves which stood at my door, and run away with it; I went after him immediately, and stopped him in Church-court, with the stove on his shoulder; I took him back, and had him committed.
I am innocent of the crime laid to my charge. I was taking it for a man that asked me if I wanted a job; I was to take it to the Hungerford Coffee-house for 6d.
He told me he was going to take it to Hungerford Coffee-house.
