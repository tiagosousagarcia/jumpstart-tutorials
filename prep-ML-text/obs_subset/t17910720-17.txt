I am a victualler ; the chaise belonged to me and Samuel Warren; I lost the knee-flap on Friday the 17th of July; it was safe at nine o'clock that night; I saw it gone on Saturday morning. I got it from Mr. Simmons.
I have got a knee flap, I bought it of the prisoner (produced) on the 18th of June; I am sure he is the man.
What did you give for it?
Eighteen-pence.
Going home I met a lad named Thomas Lack , with the flap under his arm, and he asked me whether I could sell it for him; I did not know it was stole.
I am a constable; I apprehended this man at Bow-fair; I called a coach, and told him to drive to Clerkenwell; he asked what he was to go there for: I told him; then he said, Oh, that bloody thief Thomas Lack had turned King's evidence.
