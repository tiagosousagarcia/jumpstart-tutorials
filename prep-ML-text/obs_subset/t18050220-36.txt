I am a journeyman carpenter , I live at No. 7, Lombard-court, Seven Dials : I lost the property out of the bed-room on Monday, the 21st of January, I had seen it the same morning; I left my coat on the bed; the prisoner was my bed-fellow, I left him in bed; he absconded from the lodgings the next day; I met the prisoner at Marsh-gate, Lambeth, I charged him with it, and he denied it.
I am a musician, I belong to the Duke of York's band: On the 22d of January, about eight o'clock in the evening, I went into a public-house in Rosemary-lane to get a pint of beer; while I was drinking the pint of beer, the prisoner came up to me with a pot of beer, and said, will you drink; he took the pocket-handkerchief out of my hand, and threw it in the fire; I told him I did not like that usage, I expected to be paid for it; I stopped a few minutes; then he gave me the choice of two, and said I might have either of them; this is what I received of him.
This is my handkerchief, there is a piece put in it; I am certain it is mine.
Have not more people access to that room? Have you not left the key? You know the woman of the house had the key, that I might not be prevented from going into my bed.
