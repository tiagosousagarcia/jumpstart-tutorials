I live in Fludyer-street. The week before Midsummer-day, I removed from Palace-yard to Fludyer-street. On Tuesday the 19th I left some things in the house. The watchman came to me, and informed me he had apprehended the prisoner, and found upon him several things which were my property.
I am a watchman. I observed the prisoner and another man coming out of the prosecutor's house, about two o'clock in the morning. I pursued them, and took the prisoner within ten minutes after they had got over the rails. The other escaped. I found these things (producing them) in the prisoner's apron.
I am a friendless lad, just come from abroad. My mother was on her death-bed: I left her about one o'clock. I saw this property lay down, and Richard Hunter saw me pick it up.
Did you see him pick it up?
I did not: I took him with it in his apron.
We came to the front door next morning, and it was bolted inside. We had left it only locked.
