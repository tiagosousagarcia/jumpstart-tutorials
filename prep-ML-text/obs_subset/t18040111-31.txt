On the 10th of December the prisoner took an apartment furnished of me, at No. 4, Eagle-street, Red-Lion-street , and was to pay weekly for it four shillings; I gave her the sheets and the keys. On Monday morning, about half past ten, she came home in liquor; I went up stairs, and asked her to let me look if the blankets were clean, when I found a pair of sheets, one pillow-case, one flat iron, and one blanket, were gone; she said her husband was a watchman upon the water; and asked for a pen and ink to write to him; she was taken up, and the Justice committed her; she owned to having taken the things, and pulled the duplicate out of her bosom of a sheet.
I told Mrs. Hill she should have her things in twenty-four hours if she would not hurt me; she said that was all she wanted, and would not hurt me.
