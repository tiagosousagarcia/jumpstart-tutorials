I live at No. 4, Ely-court, Holbourn . On Saturday morning the 2d of December. I and another person was down in our kitchen. I heard an alarm made by the old gentlewoman, who lodges in my fore parlour. I heard the word thief. I ran up stairs immediately and into the court. I saw a person turn the corner of Hatton-street. I made up to him and immediately seised him with the watch in his hand, and brought him back to the old Lady, Rebecca Buck , who is fourscore years old, and she said he was the person. We took him to Justice Wright's.
Do you know the watch?
I know the watch to be her property; it used to hang up by the fire-place.
In view of the window?
Yes. She swore to the watch and the prisoner before Justice Wright. When we were getting ready to go to take out the bill, it shocked her so that she has not been well since.
I own it was a fault; I had rather go abroad if you please.
