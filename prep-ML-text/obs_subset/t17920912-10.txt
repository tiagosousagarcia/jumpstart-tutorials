I am servant to Mr. Langley, he lives in Grosvenor Place ; the spoon and salt were on a sideboard in the parlour, I saw them there about twelve o'clock the day before I missed them; on Tuesday, at ten o'clock, the prisoner was in the passage near the street door, the parlour door was open, he was waiting for money for two newspapers, he was there the night before with a newspaper; I saw the things on Wednesday in the constable's hands, he has kept them ever since.
I am a constable, I produce a spoon and salt-holder, I received them from Fisher, and took the prisoner at the same time.
The prisoner came to our house on Tuesday the 28th of August, about eleven o'clock; I am certain of his person, he brought these articles to pledge for 18 s. I stopped him, and sent for a constable.
I went to serve newspapers, and coming by the turnpike, I picked the things up.
