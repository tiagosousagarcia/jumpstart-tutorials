I am in partnership with my mother, Jane Shipley; the prisoner was a porter in my house; On the 28th of September, he came to his usual employment in the shop; I took him up upon suspicion; the constable searched him the my presence, and found three duplicates of articles taken from my shop; I afterwards got a search-warrant, to search his lodgings, and there I found most of the articles in the indictment, in a box locked up, the key of which was in his possession; he gave the constable the key himself.
I am a constable: On the 28th of November, I went to Mr. Shipley's, and searched the prisoner; I found two keys and two duplicates; I went round to the pawnbrokers, and found the tools there; we afterwards went to Marlborough-street, got a warrant, and searched his lodgings, where we found these articles. (Produces a large quantity of tools).
They have all my name upon them, and some few of them have my own hand-writing upon them, my private mark; the compasses I can positively swear to.
