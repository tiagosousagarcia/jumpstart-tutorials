Sarah Page , Thomas Page , and me, are partners; I live in Postern-row, Tower-hill; I lost the things in the indictment on the 10th of March; the prisoner, who is a hair-dresser , at seven in the morning, when he had dressed my hair, being informed by our porter he had some sealing-wax, I taxed him with it; he said nothing; I took 2 lb. of wax out of his pocket; he said nothing. (Produced, and deposed to.) I saw at his house a large quantity of tape, and quills and pens, as in the indictment; they are here; I can swear to several of the articles; they are exactly the sort we use; but the wax is from our manufacturer's.
I am porter to the prosecutors: on the 10th of March, Clack came into the shop; I suspected him, and missed 2 lb. of wax, which was found in his pocket; I believe these are them.
I took the prisoner, and found this property, which the prosecutor owned.
My lawyer is not here; I have no witnesses at present; I did not know of my trial coming on till ten minutes ago.
