I am a carpenter , I was at work at the new buildings, Southampton-street, Pentonville ; on the 13th of August I went to work about five o'clock in the morning, I had left the tools there on the night of the 12th, some laying on the bench and some on the shelf, in the house; I found the top rail broke down, and the shutters very much bent, and the top bolt off, and the shutters were pushed too again.
I am a carpenter, I had left my tools on the 12th in the same building.
I am a watchman, I stopt the prisoner at the side of the Chapel, Battle-bridge, on the 13th of August, just before one, and asked him what he had there? he said, he was a carpenter, and was come from work out in the country, and was going home. I secured him and the tools too. I delivered them to the constable of the night.
I went to Kentish-Town to carry a kit of salmon, and as I was coming back I saw these tools lay in the road, and I picked them up, and put them into my apron.
