I lodge in Rose-street, Soho . On the 31st of October I lost the several particulars mentioned in the indictment. Thirteen pair of stockings, eleven of which were thread, not mentioned in the indictment, and two frocks, two aprons, two shifts, two caps, and four handkerchiefs were lost on the last day of October. I had taken the prisoner into my apartment to lodge with me for a few days. The last day of October she left me, and stole the several things mentioned in the indictment. She was taken up on the 2d of November, and upon her legs a pair of my stockings were found; a handkerchief was found upon her, and a child's cap. She was carried before a justice; there she voluntarily acknowledged that she had sold the other particulars mentioned in the indictment, to a Jew.
I was present at the office when the prisoner was searched, and these things were found upon her.
A great deal she has sworn is as false as God is true. I have no friend in London. I beg the court will be merciful to me on account of my youth. I am not twenty years old; and I am almost seven months gone with child.
