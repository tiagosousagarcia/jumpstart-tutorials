I carry on the business of a glass seller . This servant had been with me eleven months, and a few days: I received some information that induced a suspicion against the prisoner, and directed he should be watched.
You had a partner?
Yes; his name was Henry Janson ; he is dead; I am the surviving partner; Priscilla Harrison , who was the administratrix of Mr. Janson, has married Mr. Thomas Harrison , and so they are in some degree in partnership with my business, and interested in the trade.
I am a servant of Mr. Popplewell's; and was directed to watch the prisoner at the bar; I saw him take a bottle out of a prickle, and step to the door with it; and afterwards Mr. Janson came and told the prisoner he might go home for that time; which he did; and I went after him, and brought him back, and found a glass bottle concealed in his smock frock, as low down as his knees; he had a surtout coat, and under that a smock frock; there was a place, seemingly made on purpose to hold a bottle; he seemed very sorry, and asked Mr. Popplewell a thousand pardons; I have no doubt in the least to it's being Mr. Popplewell's property.
When I came home I directed this man to go; then Brown called him back again, and he took the bottle out of some part of his dress; he, himself, admitted, he took the bottle, but that it was to carry home some liquor to his wife.
I had this bottle to bring some small beer in, as the prosecutor did not like to see a pint of porter brought in, while we were washing the bottles.
Was there any thing in the bottle?
No; it was a new bottle, and nothing in it; it had the bloom on.
