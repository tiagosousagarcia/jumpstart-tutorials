- I am a publican , I live in Castle-street, Oxford-market ; the prisoner at the bar came to my house about ten o'clock in the evening of the 15th of November; he went into the parlour, where there were more company, and called for four-pennyworth of gin and water, and after that he had another four-penny worth, that was all he had; the company which were in the parlour withdrew about eleven, and he staid there till near twelve, or quite twelve, by himself; by and by my wife heard a noise in the parlour, and she called to me, and I directly went in and found the cupboard door had been broke open; the prisoner was hurrying out, and endeavouring to put the candle out; I looked into the cupboard, and I missed three bottles off a shelf; I then hurried out into the passage, where I took him by the collar, and then said to him, you villain, you have broke open my cupboard door, and stolen some bottles from me, my property; he stood with his right hand under his coat in this form, (describing it) and he out with his right hand and said, here, takes your bottle; he gave me the bottle which he had in his hand, and then I felt and found there was one bottle in his left pocket, and another in his right, and the watchman and myself, and another young man, took them from him, (the bottles produced); here is likewise the lock of the door which he broke, it was forced with a screw-driver, I believe; I found a screw-driver and three knives upon him; these are my bottles; I had fifteen bottles, and when I went I found only twelve.
Was the man sober?
I cannot say he was altogether sober, but he made himself worse after he was taken into custody.
I was so much in liquor I did not know any thing of the transaction till the Sunday morning. GUILTY , aged 49 - Confined six months in the House of Correction , and fined 1s .
