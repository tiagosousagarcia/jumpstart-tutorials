I am servant to John Bourne, No. 8, Union-court, Broad-street ; I was in the house on Mon day the 17th of October, about nine o'clock in the morning, in the parlour; Mrs. Bourne was not come down stairs; the prisoner came in and opened the counting-house, the outer door was open, and I saw him go out down the steps with the desk; Mr. Engstrem had gone out about five minutes before, and shut the door; I followed the prisoner as quick as I could; I took it from him, and gave a man charge of him in the street; I am sure he is the same person.
This house is Mr. Bourne's; I have only a counting-house in it; I went out on Monday the 17th of October, and shut the door after me; I will not swear it was latched.
I am sure it was latched; I was at the door a few minutes before.
On Monday the 17th of October, Mr. Engstrem sent for me to take the prisoner into custody; I had this desk of Sarah Jennings . (Producing it).
Is that the desk?
Yes; it is Mr. Engstrem's.
This is my desk.
I was coming down the court, and a young man told me he would give me a shilling to carry it for him to the pitching-block.
