I am a slopseller in Wapping , on the 22d of January the prisoner came to my house after dark, to buy some check aprons, I shewed her two pieces, neither would suit her, I let the two pieces lay on the counter, she said she wanted a pair of black stockings; she bought a pair of two shillings, and a pair of buckles at eighteen pence, she paid for them and went out, one of the pieces of check fell behind the counter, just before she went out I went round to pick it up and it was gone, I called my servant to run after the prisoner, she told me she was going for a pair of shoes, I fastened my door and went after her, I took her, she had not got to the shoemaker's, the check dropped directly from under her cloaths, she begged to go, I took her home, and she offered me the stockings and buckles and eighteen pence to let her go, I would not.
she came into your shop?
No; I saw it fall, the check fell of the side shew, it was thirty-one yards, I thought it was an accident;
How many pieces of check did you shew?
Two.
How happened it you did not go round and take up the check?
I never saw the prisoner stoop, I had no suspicion, she looked a hard working young woman.
How could she take this check without stooping?
I did not perceive her stoop, which way she took it or which way she dropped it I do not know, she touched none of her cloaths.
It might be kicked by her into the street?
No, my lord, she had got near a hundred yards.
How far was the prisoner when she was looking at the checks, from the door?
Half the distance between you and me.
Was not the check loose at one end?
No, it was tied at both ends; my master told me the woman had stolen some check who had been in the shop, I stopped the first woman I met, it was about a hundred yards, my master came and took the prisoner, I saw the check fall from her, I believe it fell from under her apron.
This is a very severe law, the check may be all holes, you may value it under five shillings.
