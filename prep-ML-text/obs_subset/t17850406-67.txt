I live in James-court, Old-street; I am a servant , I was robbed on the 22d of last month, about eight at night, in Old-street ; I had been towards the church, and was coming home from there, and as I was coming along, that there man stood and catched me in his arms, and took my cloak, and put it under his arm and ran away, and I run and cried stop thief.
Did he speak to you?
No.
Had he any thing in his hand?
Nothing that I saw.
How old are you?
Turned of fifteen; I never saw him before to my knowledge; I was near the lamps, it was moon-light, he was taken directly, he ran down Whitecross-street, and was taken in that street; I do not know the gentleman's name that took him, he is here; I was just out of sight when he was taken; the constable has my cloak; it was the cloak of Elizabeth Webb .
I am the officer that took charge of the man; the cloak was then delivered to me; I did not take him.
I heard the cry of stop thief, I was walking up White-cross-street, I crossed the way, and the prisoner jumped right against me; I immediately stopped him, and just before I laid hold of him, I saw him drop the cloak.
I had been after a place, and coming down Old-street I passed this young woman, several people were coming, I heard the cry of stop thief, and was stopped by the butcher; another gentleman came up to the young woman, and says, here is your cloak.
What are you?
I am a gentleman's servant; I believe I have people to speak for me, they have been here three days.
