I am warehouseman to Mr. Bolt; the warehouses are on Dice-quay : On Good-Friday, I had some suspicion of the prisoner, I watched in the warehouse and saw the prisoner and two more; I and another man had each of us a brace and half of pistols; and in about a quarter of an hour I heard a picklock-key put into the door, and they came in; I was on a floor ten feet and a half over their heads; I opened the door over their heads, put the muzzle of the pistol against the door, and told them, the first man that went out I would blow his brains out; I could have shot them both if I had been disposed; I then called out to two custom-house watchmen, and the prisoner at the bar jumped out and ran up the gateway; I shot at his legs; the other ran out, and the man that was with me fired his pistol, and the flash was so near me that it obscured my sight, and they both escaped; we have not been able to take the other man; we took the prisoner the next morning upon Galley-quay; I am sure he is the man; I saw his face several times; he had on the same dress that he has now; I found two bags in the warehouse.
I am an officer:
I believe these to be the same bags.
I am as innocent as the child unborn.
