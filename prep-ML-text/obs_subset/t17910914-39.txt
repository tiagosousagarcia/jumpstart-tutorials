I am a baker , the man went out to serve the customers.
I am servant to Mr. Dron, he lives at No. 18, Minories; on the 1st of September I was going over Tower-hill with my basket of bread, and my wife overtook me, and I asked her to go with me to Grace-church-street , to see if we could find the person that had taken so much bread from me; we went to Grace-church-street, and I left my basket facing Talbot-court, as usual, and went about the city with some bread: I left my wife in the care of the basket, when I returned, I found four quartern loaves gone out of my basket, and could not see my wife; I was going towards home, and coming towards Talbot-court, I saw a mob, and my wife and the prisoner were together in the mob, and the man was in the constable's custody.
I am the wife of the last witness, I was left in care of the basket opposite the Talbot; I saw, about three minutes after my husband went, the prisoner at the bar come and look into it, and then for about half an hour walk backward and forward; at last he went to the basket, and took four quartern loaves, and came right across the street, running to the end of the court where I was standing; I had a little child in my hands about two years old, and I got hold of him by the other, and asked him what he was going to do with that bread; he said what was that to me: I told him my husband had given me the care of the basket, and they were my husband's property; with that he gave himself a fling out of my hands, and I ran after him, and cried out stop thief; and he came to the constable's door, and the constable took him into custody; he was never five yards from me, he carried two loaves under one arm, and the other two on the top of them, and his hands upon that.
I am a constable; I live in Talbot-court, Grace-church-street; on the 1st of September, I heard the cry of stop thief, and I went to the door, and I saw the man with the loaves under his arm; he laid the loaves down at the bench at the door, and the woman said he stole them from her husband; if that is the case, says I, he must not go, I shall take him into my possession; I kept the loaves till the next morning, when I went before the Lord Mayor, and then I marked them.
I had got an acquaintance a journeyman bakers, he pitched his basket in Grace-church-street, and he sent me to fetch four quartern loaves, and I very innocently went to the wrong basket.
