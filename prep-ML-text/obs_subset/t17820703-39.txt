I keep a public-house in the Old-Bailey . On the 21st of June, the prisoner came into my house, and had a pennyworth of beer; a person informed me, she had put a pot of mine into her pocket. I pursued her, and took her in Fleet-lane, and brought her back. I found a quart pewter pot under her apron, and my boy took a half-pint pot out of her pocket.
I live with Mr. Frisbee. When the prisoner was brought back, I took a half-pint pot out of her pocket.
I was very much in liquor: I know nothing of it.
