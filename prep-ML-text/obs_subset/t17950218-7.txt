I am a carpenter .
Do you know the prisoner?
No.
Did you lose a hand saw?
Yes, on Monday morning last, it was taken from the first floor of the Pantheon , where I was at work.
Had you seen it there that morning?
No, I had not been at work that morning, we had been at work on Sunday; our master told us that if we would not work on Sunday we might go about our business, and work being scarce we worked; we left work at five o'clock on Sunday evening.
Who told you to work on Sunday?
My master.
And you did not work?
Yes, I did.
I am sorry for it. What time did you come the next morning?
About a quarter past seven, and the hand saw was gone then.
Have you ever seen it since?
Yes, it was found hid under some bricklayers hair, in a vault backwards, were this labourer was employed to make mortar.
What reason have you to think that he took the hand saw?
Joseph Mumford see him take it and sting it down between the joists of the floor.
I saw the man take the hand saw from the place where the owner left it, and he threw it through some joists among some rubbish, and while I was gone to let my shopmates know, the saw was gone from there to this vault where we found it.
I never meddled with the saw at all; how could he swear to me when several persons were in my dress in particular?
There were none there then only him.
