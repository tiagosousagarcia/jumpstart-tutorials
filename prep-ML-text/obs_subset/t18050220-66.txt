I am a linen-draper , at No. 43, Bishopsgate Without : On the 15th of February the prisoner took from my door a bundle of printed cotton, it was placed on a stool at the door.
I am shopman to Mr. Twell: On the 15th of February, about half past three, or near four o'clock, in the afternoon, a woman called in, and informed me, that the prisoner at the bar had taken the cotton from the door; I immediately pursued after him, and took him with the cotton under his arm.
How far had he got from your shop?
From 150 to 250 yards from the door; I requested him to go back with me, and told him I wanted the goods that he had; he immediately delivered them to me; there was an officer there; I brought back the goods, and the officer brought him back to the shop.
This was hanging up outside of the house?
No, they were on a stool.
Outside of the house?
Yes; persons are not obliged to take them.
Nor are you obliged to put them out in the street.
I was coming along Bishopsgate-street, between three and four o'clock, on the 15th of this month, and the prisoner at the bar passed by me, with this property under his arm; I kept my eye upon him, and in a very short time Mr. Drewett came up and caught hold of the prisoner; I went to his assistance, and he gave charge of the prisoner, and I took him to the Compter; I produce the goods; I have had them in my possession ever since.
Did you ask the prisoner where he got those goods?
Yes, he said a person gave them to him to carry.
Are they your master's goods?
They are the goods that I put out at the door in the morning.
