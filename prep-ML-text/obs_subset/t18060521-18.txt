I am a hair dresser , I live at No. 16, Bear-street, Liecester-square ; the prisoner was my journeyman . On Friday, the 9th of May, I pulled my shirt off in the afternoon, and I missed it the same afternoon; I did not accuse him till the Tuesday, and on Friday, the 16th, I went and took a search warrant, and went to the Duke of Clarence, St. James's, where he lodged; the constable searched the drawers, and the first thing that he found was two razors, the next thing he found was a pocket book with the duplicate of the shirt.
I am an officer; on the 16th of May I went with a search warrant to the prisoner's lodging, and there I found these two razors and the duplicate of the shirt; I produce the razors.
I am a pawnbroker, I produce the shirt, the shirt was pawned by the prisoner for five shillings. (The property identified by the prosecutor.)
I took this shirt with intent to bring it back when I received my wages.
