I saw Mr. Shelton sign it; (it is read.) I was present at the sessions, in December, 1796.
How long had he been in custody before that time, so as to enable you to he certain he is the man?
He was in custody with us for some months afterwards; he had a conditional pardon to serve as a soldier, in the 60th regiment, in the West-Indies; I was not present at the delivery of him, he was sent to Southampton, about six or seven months after his conviction.
On the 6th of May, a little after four in the morning, I saw the prisoner and another person, of the name of Thomas Pursell , that I suspected of being base characters, inspecting all the areas; the prisoner attempted to get into a bakar's yard, in Carbutton street, but was prevented; I took him into custody, he was only liberated on the 1st of May from the House of Correction, where he had been six months upon a conviction, as a rogue and vagabond.
I am servant to the keeper of Clerkenwell prison; I was going to lock the prisoner up, and he told me he was a returned transport; he said, he was tried along with his wife; he said, she was acquitted, and he was convicted, and he desired me to tell Sir William Addington so, which I did.
I was pardoned for a soldier; I went to Southampton, I went on board a transport, I was sent a-shore to sick quarters, at Southampton; I had been out late one night, and was pressed on board the Royal William, at Spithead, and then drafted on board the Albion, and there I remained till she was cast away off Harwich, coming up Swinn, and then I was drafted on board the Sandwich, and then sent on board the Lancaster, at Long-reach; then I was sent to Woolwich at sick quarters, and from thence to Guy's-hospital; when I was discharged from there, I went to Somerset-house, and had my free discharge.
Do you know if this man ever went by the name of William Russell ?
Never.
Do you know any thing of his going by the name of William Russell?
Yes; I have never known him by any other name.
