You are a seeds man ?
Yes.
What do you know respecting the loss of these articles?
The articles were put into the cart, as is the usual way, when the cart was coming into the City and were lost, they were put into the cart last Tuesday afternoon, I directed the parcel myself in the morning, it was packed by myself, or by order, however I was present, the articles were fourteen pounds of carrot seeds, two pounds of savoy seeds, and four ounces of lettice seed.
I am a carman; I put several articles in the cart.
Do you know what these bags contained?
All kinds of seed.
Did you know that that bag was put into the cart?
Yes.
Did you know the contents of it before it was put in?
No.
Who did you receive it of, and where was it to go to?
It was to go to Peterborough; I took it to my masters house, No. 63, in the Strand.
Where was you directed to take that cart and bag to?
To the Horse Shoe, in Goswell-street.
Was it to go by any waggon from thence?
By the Peterborough waggon; it was directed to Thomas Fletcher, of Peterborough.
You had other articles in your cart, which you was to leave somewhere else?
Yes.
What time of the day did you put it in your cart?
Between four and five o'clock.
Did you set out with your cart?
Yes.
Did you miss any thing out of your cart before you went out?
No.
What was the day of the month?
The 18th of this month.
What do you know about losing any thing?
Is that man here?
No. He said if I ran down Aldersgate-street I should meet the person; I left my cart and went after him.
Did you leave any body in charge of your cart?
No.
Why you might have lost all the other things out of it?
I might, my lord.
Then at that time you had not missed the bag yourself from the cart?
I had not.
And was you so imprudent as to leave your goods and the cart? What did you do?
I found this man, the prisoner, with this bag under his arm; I saw him coming out of a court that leads into Aldersgate-street; one of his acquaintance hallooed out to him, he directly jumps down in the street and lets the bag fall, there were two more with him, one of them hallooed out to him a word, boy. I picked up the bag and hallooed out stop thief! a man on the other side of the way catched hold of him by the breast, and held him till I came to him and seized him.
Had you seen him at all about your cart, or following it?
No, I did not take any notice.
How far was it from the place that the bag was dropped, that the man was collared?
Not fifteen yards.
Is the man here who collared him?
No, he is not. The man held him till I came up to him, and I took him into a public house till a constable came, and I gave charge of him, and kept the bag in my hand.
Then you swear you never lost sight of the prisoner from the time that you saw him with his companions, and from the time that he dropped the bag, till he was collared?
Never.
And you are very sure that the man that you took from the public house, was the man that dropped the bag?
Yes.
What became of his companion?
I never see any thing of him after.
Did you see the bag opened afterwards?
It has never been opened from that time to this; the bag was delivered to the officer.
Who has had the possession of that bag?
James Newman, the officer.
Did I make any resistance?
He cried, and said he was ill used.
How was the head of the cart secured?
With the tail board.
Had you stopped any where?
No. The tail board continued up after the bag was taken out.
I am the constable; I was coming up Long lane between five and six Thursday evening, the 18th of this month, one of Mr. Cannon's men told me that the cart had been robbed, and that there was a man wanted a constable at the Coach and Horses; I immediately went there, I found the prisoner at the bar there, Mr. Mynheer's man had him in hold there, the last witness, Mr. Belton, he gave me the bag directly, and gave me charge of the man; that bag has been in my possession ever since, and has not been opened.
Are there any marks on the bag?
I can swear to the directions being my own hand writing, the four ounces are laid long ways, and packed on the two pounds.
I was going down Aldersgate-street, I heard the cry of stop thief! and some hackney coachman held me by the collar, and laid, here is one of them, and they stopped me; I was in custody five minutes before the man came and took hold of me; I said I was very willing to go any where, where they pleased to take me. I never knew any thing about it.
You are very sure you saw the prisoner drop the bag?
I did.
