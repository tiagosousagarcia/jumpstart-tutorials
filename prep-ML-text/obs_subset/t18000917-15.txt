I am an apprentice to Mr. Jonathan Sparrow , ironmonger , in West Smithfield : On Tuesday the 12th of August last, about five o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner was brought into our house, by our porter, with the property upon him; I know the iron to be Mr. Sparrow's property by the mark at the end of it; the smith that made it for us, about a week ago, out it too short, and was obliged to weld it; I can positively swear to it.
I am porter to Mr. Sparrow: I was coming home, about one hundred yards from the warehouse, when I met the prisoner turning up Charterhouse-lane with a bar upon his shoulder; I asked him where he was going with it; he said he bought it at an ironmongers, but he could not shew me where; a constable was sent for, and he was delivered to him. (The constable produced the property, which was deposed to by Wright).
I had been three days without victuals, I could get no work to do; I have no friends, I come from Dartmouth.
(To Wright.) Where was it left?
Close by the warehouse-door, where he could easily put his hand in and take it out.
