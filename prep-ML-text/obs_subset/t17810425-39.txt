I am servant to Mr. Allen; I left seven pair of shoes on a board in the wash-house over night; I missed them when I got up between six and seven in the morning; four pair were my own, a pair my master's, another pair my young master's, and a pair of Mr. Curling's, a gentleman who lives in the house: my master had the prisoner taken up, and he owned before the justice, that he had taken the shoes; he said, he had sold some, and pawned the others.
Was any promise made him, or threats, to induce him to confess?
No; I did not hear any; he owned he had taken them, as soon as it was laid to his charge: they were produced in the office by Edmund Wade .
I took the prisoner up by the information of his master; before he went into the room before the justice, he told me, there were two pair of shoes pawned in Norton-Falgate, at one Dulfour's; I went with him, and found the shoes there.
It is the first time I was ever taken up in my life; before the justice, Mr. Allen said he would give me two guineas to get me a place, and withdraw the prosecution, if it cost him 40 l.
Had he been in Mr. Allen's service?
Yes; he was in it at this time.
