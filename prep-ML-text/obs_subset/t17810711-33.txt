I am master of one of the hulks at Woolwich . The prisoner was on board my hulk. He escaped on the 5th or 6th of February. He had been there better than two years. I have here the certificate of his conviction, which I saw signed by Mr. Selby, the clerk of the peace at Hick's-hall.
How did he get away?
He swam a-shore, about six in the morning, with an iron upon one leg.
I received information that the prisoner had escaped from the ballast-lighters. I apprehended him at the Boot, in Cross-lane, St. Giles's. I took him before the justice, and he was committed.
Are you certain as to the person of the prisoner?
Very certain.
How did he behave the two years he was on board?
Extremely well.
Sir John Hawkins promised me, when he tried me, if I behaved well, he would endeavour to get me off in a few months.
When was he apprehended by you?
On the 4th of June.
