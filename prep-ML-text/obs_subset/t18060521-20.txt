I lodge at Robert Moreton 's house, One Tun-court, St. Martin's. On Tuesday, April the 22nd, I arose from my bed, I went to my box, and opened and looked at my watch to see what o'clock it was, it was then half past seven, I then put the watch in my box again, and went to work; I returned about half past two to dinner, and to clean myself; I went up stairs and opened my box, I found my watch was gone; I then went down stairs, and enquired of the servant maid, Eleanor Russel , if she had seen any thing of the watch, she said no, she said you may depend upon it George Singleton has got it, it is gone like the young man's shirts; I then went up and examined my box again, and found no watch there.
Did you find your watch.
Yes, at Christopher Brown's, No. 2, Panton-street, in the Hay Market.
I live at No. 2, Panton-street, in the Hay Market, I am servant to Mr. Brown. On the 22nd of April, the prisoner pledged a silver watch with me, she described it as her husbands, I lent her twenty-seven shillings on it. (The watch identified by the prosecutor.)
I live servant in this house, and the lodger asked me to pawn it for him, the man being sick, I pawned it for him, his name is George Singleton ; he told me if the pawnbroker asked any questions to say it was my husband's; he now denies he ever gave it me.
