- I lodge in Globe-lane, Bethnal-green : On the 25th of July I lost the things stated in the indictment; the prisoner lodged in the next room; I missed the things out of a trunk, on the 27th I saw them again at a pawnbroker's, and at Mrs. Jackson's, where they were sold.
I am an officer, and produce the petticoats, shift, and other things, which I got from Mrs. Jackson on Wednesday the 27th; when I apprehended the prisoner, she told me she had pawned them, and sold some to Mrs. Jackson.
- I live at Mile-end, and know the prisoner: On the 27th of July she sold me these things, which I delivered to the officer.
- I am a pawnbroker in Whitechapel-road; the prisoner pawned a shift, a white apron, a frock, and an half handkerchief.(The things produced and identified.)
The door is open all night; my husband is a prisoner in the guard-house, being a soldier in the Tower Hamlets militia; I went home late at night, and found the bundle on the stairs, which I pledged.
