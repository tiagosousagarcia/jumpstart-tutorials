I am a housekeeper , I lost a pair of silver shoe-buckles, on the 19th of July, from my parlour, in Penton-street ; I discovered the loss in about three minutes after they were gone, it was about eight o'clock in the morning.
A person told me that the house had been robbed.
I was standing at the parlour window opposite, and saw the prisoner go in, and walk about the parlour, I went over the way, and knocked at the door, and he came out, and I asked him who he wanted, he mentioned some name; he said he lived just by at the corner; I said I did not believe that, and I having a suspicion, told him they lodged up stairs; a gentleman was coming by, and I desired him to stop him, as I thought he had something under his coat; he was taken and brought back to the door, I am positive of the prisoner.
I stopped the prisoner about a quarter of a mile from the house; I did not see any thing taken from him.
I produce the cloak and buckles; I had them of the justice, I searched him, but found nothing but an old knife upon him.
I helped to apprehend the prisoner, I saw him drop a black silk-cloak, and a pair of silver buckles, close to my feet, a quarter of a mile before he was taken; I never lost sight of him.
If I had had a friend, I should have got through this business, that I see, but I am lost for want of a friend; where they have fetched this man from I do not know.
