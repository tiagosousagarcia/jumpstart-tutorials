- I live near the Turnpike, Oxford-road , my husband is a stocking weaver : The prisoner said she was a servant-maid out of place ; she came to lodge with us in the month of June; my husband sent me a parcel in the name of Martin; she said, as you are a poor woman I will go and fetch it; she did, but never brought it to me. NOT GUILTY .
