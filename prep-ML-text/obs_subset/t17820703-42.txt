On the 29th of June, as I was going along the street, I found the prisoner's hand in my pocket. On turning round, I saw a handkerchief in his hand, and saw him drop it. I took him instantly to the Compter. The handkerchief he dropped was my property.
I have not a friend in the world. I hope your Lordship will let me go abroad.
