- I keep the Prince of Wales public-house, in Holywell-lane : On the 4th of January, an officer brought the prisoner and the pots into my house, between four and five in the afternoon.
I am pot-boy to Mr. Campbell: On the 4th of January, I left my pots at Mr. Gant's door in Shoreditch , tied to the scraper of a door with a string; I left two pints and one quart while I went to the turnpike for some more pots; I always the them there; when I came back I only found one pint pot there. I left them at a quarter past four, and did not see them again till half past six, when they were brought to my master's house.
I am brother-in-law to Mr. Clark, a publican: Yesterday was a week I was getting in my pots, and left my strap at Mr. Crosby's door, in Leonard-square; I saw the prisoner unsasten the strap, I came up and asked her what she did that for; and she said, a little boy had done it; but no little boy was near; I laid hold of her right arm, and saw a quart pot under her cloak; I sent for my brother-in-law, and a pint pot was found upon her. An officer was sent for, and I went with him to the prosecutor's, and he claimed the pots.
I leave it to the gentlemen of the Jury.
