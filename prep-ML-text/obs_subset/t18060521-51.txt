I am in the employ of Mr. Brodie, his manufactory is in Carey-street, Chancery-lane. On the 8th of May I saw two iron eye-bolts lay on an iron stall in Covent Garden market, I thought I knew them to be Mr. Brodie's, I asked the price of them, they asked a shilling, I bought them of Martha Oakes , and I acquainted the foreman of the factory.
I am foreman to Mr. Brodie; on the 8th of May, from an information of John Massey , I went with him and the time-keeper to Covent Garden, and bought this eye-bolt for nine pence of William Ray ; from information, I went home and detained the prisoner.
I keep an iron stall in Covent Garden; about a month or five weeks ago, I bought two eye bolts of a woman, I sold them to Massey.
Do you know any thing of John West .
No.
I keep an iron stall in Covent Garden; the eye bolt I sold to John Mutch , I purchased of the prisoner at the bar, I gave him six pence for it.
I received the prisoner in charge, and the property, I produce them.
I believe them to be Mr. Brodie's property.
I leave it entirely to the mercy of your lordship, and the lenity of the prosecutor.
