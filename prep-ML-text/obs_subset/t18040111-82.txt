I live at the Gun and Star, Petticoat-lane ; I know the prisoner; she came to me for a pint of beer; she gave me a shilling; I gave it to my master; he said it was a bad one, and I returned it to her; there was a man of the name of Callaghan with her; she gave me another; my master said that was a bad one; he went into the tap-room, and asked the prisoner if she had any more; I said, I saw her with more; my master sent for a constable, Mr. Gassen; he did not know how to search her, and sent for Elisha Crabb , and he searched her; I gave both the shillings to my master.
I keep the Gun and Star; I went into the tap-room, and asked the prisoner if she had any more of the same sort; I heard some rattle; I took two from her hand, and I found one of them was the first that the boy brought to me; I had rubbed it; I found the other was a bad one, and I sent for a constable; he did not know how to search her, and then I set for Crabb.
I searched the prisoner; I received three shillings from the landlord, and found four more between her shift and her flesh; we took the man before the Lord Mayor, and he was discharged.
My husband lives with another woman; I have three children, and my husband gave me this money to buy shoes for them.
