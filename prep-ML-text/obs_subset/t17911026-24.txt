I lost some lead the day before yesterday from the back gates; I saw it ten minutes before it was taken away. A neighbour pursued the man.
I live within a few doors of Mr. Kendall. I saw the prisoner go by with some lead; he came back, and went to Kendall's yard. I went round, and told his hostler I thought some lead had been taken away; while I was talking, the prisoner came out with another piece of lead. I watched him, and saw him deposit the lead in a house in Ball-yard.
The foreman of the carpenters cut the lead, and sold it; and he sent me another time with another piece, and I sold it for fourteen pence.
