- I am a carrier , and live near Biggleswade: On Saturday the 8th of November, about twelve o'clock, a young lad came and hinted to me there was such a sort of lad about, and asked me if I saw him; he desired me to be careful of the waggon, I was so, and I saw him walking down St. John's-street, and making the best of his way from the waggon, he seemed to have something concealed under his coat, I catched him, and this dropped from him, I know it to be mine.
I am a constable, and took the prisoner in charge.
I was coming down St. John's-street, and saw that lay at the side of the pavement. GUILTY , aged 14.
