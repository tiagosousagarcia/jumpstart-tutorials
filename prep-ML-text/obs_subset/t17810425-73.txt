I am between fourteen and fifteen years old. On Easter Monday, between twelve and one o'clock, I was in the skittle-ground, in Tothill-street, with three coal-heavers; they gave me some drink, and I fell asleep; I saw the prisoner there; I was carried out of one place into another; I waked between two and three o'clock, and my buckles were gone; I saw them again last Saturday, in Mr. Mason's shew glass, who is a silversmith.
I bought these buckles on Easter Monday, about two o'clock, of the prisoner; he came into my shop, and took them out of his shoes; they weighed five ounces; I gave him 20 s. for them. I believe the prisoner is the man. A neighbouring boy said, he knew who the buckles belonged to; I described the person I bought them of, and by that means the prisoner was taken.
I was in the shop when the prisoner sold the buckles; there was not any person with him.
I was with the prosecutor when he bought these buckles, eight weeks ago.
A soldier asked me to sell these buckles for him; he shewed me a place where to sell them; he stood in the street. I went and sold them for 20 s. and gave him the money; I knew him by sight; I do not know where he is; I have never seen him since.
