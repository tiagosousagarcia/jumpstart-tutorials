Did he walk off with them?
Yes, he was gone from the basket about ten or a dozen yards, I took him, and there was a constable just by, and I gave charge to the constable.
But they are laid to be your property?
Because I am obliged to pay for all I take out, that is the rule at our house.
I am a patrole of Whitecross-street, St. Luke's parish. I saw the man take the bread, the basket was standing right opposite Church-alley, in Basinghall-street, he took one loaf, and then he returned again and took another.
Did you take the loaves from them?
No, the constable did.
I was sent for to take the loaves out of the prisoner's apron. These are the loaves, they have been in my custody ever since, I did not see him take them.
There is no particular mark on them.
I was in great distress at this time, I had been out of work thirteen weeks, and had been bad with a fever, and had a little child bad with the small pox, and my landlord when I got a little better, he was going to seize all my goods; I attended the market in the morning, to do what I could, I was almost starved at the time, we had but a two penny loaf between my wife and child for two days.
