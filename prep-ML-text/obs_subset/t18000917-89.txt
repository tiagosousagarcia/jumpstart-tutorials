I live at No. 42, Wych-Street: I am a tailor ; I had a suit of cloaths to make, and it was very late on Saturday night before I finished them; I was afraid the person might want them early on Sunday morning; I took them home, but he was gone to bed; I called in, and had part of sixpennyworth of gin and water, and going along Butcher-row on Sunday morning, about three o'clock, with the bundle containing the cloaths, near St. Clement's Church-yard , I saw a dozen men, or more, in the road; I kept the path, and saw four or five of them single themselves out to meet me, which they did, on the kirb; one struck me down, and the others fell to kicking me as hard as they could, in such a manner, that I was hardly able to get up; I kept hold of the bundle as long as I could, till one got it, and then they all run away; I don't know who it was that took it; it was one of the four or five that took it; I called the watchman, and told him I had been robbed, and that, to the best of my knowledge, one had one up a court; he directly got another watchman, and they went up the court, and found the bundle, I did not go with them; I found that young man pretending to be asleep in the necessary; it is called Star-court, just by Temple-bar, where there is no thoroughfare; he was then taken to the watch-house, nobody else was found in the court, but him, and the bundle; I cannot say who knocked me down, and robbed me, they did it in a moment; the watchman has the bundle.
I am a watchman of St. Clement's Danes: Between three and four o'clock, last Sunday morning, I heard the prosecutor calling out, watch; I immediately crossed the street, and asked him what was the matter; he said he had been knocked down and robbed, and he believed one of them had ran up Star-court, and, I said, if so, he was safe, as there was no thoroughfare; we got a light, and I went up the court, and picked up a bundle, the other watchman followed me; it could not be more than two or three minutes after, I heard the prosecutor call out; after finding the bundle, I went forward, and examined every door, to see if they were open; there was none open, and I proceeded till I came to the necessary, at the end, on the left-hand side, where I found the prisoner, laying at full length, pretending to be asleep; the door was ajar; I told him to get up, which he did; I asked him what brought him there; he said he had been at work for a gentleman, near Spring-gardens, and had finished it that day; that the gentleman had given them a supper, and he had drank rather too much, and had got up there and laid down to sleep; he appeared to me perfectly sober; I have had the bundle ever since.
I was at work at Spring-gardens; we had finished the house of a gentleman, and he gave the tradesman a supper; about half past ten, it was brought on the table; from that time we were drinking till twelve, or thereabouts; I made too free, and, in going along Fleet-street, I went up this court, and laid down to sleep at three or four o'clock; the watchman came and took me up, and told me the same he has here; my master is a plaisterer, in Gutter-lane, Cheapside; I saw him yesterday afternoon, and he said he would attend to-day to my character.
