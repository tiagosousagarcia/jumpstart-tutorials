I am servant to Mr. John Childs .
Did you lose any money in the month of November last?
I believe it was about that time, about thirty pounds; it was in a box in the room where I sleep, in Mr. Childs' house.
Was the box locked?
I cannot say; I found it unlocked when I missed my money. I had never found it unlocked before; I used to keep it locked.
Was it unlocked, or had it been broke open?
Unlocked; my money was gone.
How long before you missed your money had you seen it?
About four days.
Did you count your money?
No; it was in a paper; I cannot say how long before I had counted it.
For days before had you seen the money or only the paper?
The money; I opened the paper. At the time I lost my money the prisoner was flush of money and was changing gold. He was a soldier in the Royal Irish quartered in the house; he changed about three guineas that I heard of; that gave me a suspicion of him.
Was he taken up?
Yes; the serjeant took him up and he was put in the Guard House and kept there for seven or eight days; then he was let out; then he changed more gold and I had him taken up again.
What did he change then?
About three guineas; I don't know what he changed before; we had him before Justice Hayes, who committed him to prison; I can say nothing more against him.
Are there any other witnesses?
Only where he changed some money.
