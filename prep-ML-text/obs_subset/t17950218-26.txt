I live the corner of Bishopsgate-street, and I have a shop on Holborn-bridge , this property was stole from Holborn-bridge; I know nothing of the circumstances, I can only identify the property.
I live next door to Mr. Waithman, I am in the collar way.
Did you see the prisoner take the property?
I will tell you as briefly as I can. It was the 16th of January, between five and six in the evening, near six, it was after dark; I see the prisoner and two in company with him; I see them standing about the shop window, indeed one of my servants told me they were about; I went out and watched them, and I see the prisoner open Mr. Waithman's shop door, put his hand in and draw a piece of linen from the window; he had it about half way from the window, when I caught hold of his hand, and had a scuffle with him, and dragged him into the shop, and there was a patrol coming by at the time, and he was given charge of him.
Describe how this linen was, in a bundle or loose, or how?
It was in the window, as linen drapers generally have for a shew.
Was the whole dragged out?
No, it was not, it was a large piece about ten yards, and only part of it was dragged out.
Can you say from the situation in which you found him, and from the situation in which it was at the window, that every part was removed from the window?
No, I do not believe the whole was removed, the greatest part was.
Were you in the shop at the time?
Yes, I was.
Can you say whether the whole was removed from the window, or only dragged?
I cannot say, I was at the other end of the shop.
