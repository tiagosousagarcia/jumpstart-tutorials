On the 10th of last month, I lost two shirts, a pair of pantaloons, and three pair of stockings; and on the Monday after, I saw the shirt and the pantaloons hanging at the door of a man that is here, his name is John Mitchell ; he said that he bought them; I went on board again, and came on shore again, and Mitchell told me he had got the man; that is all I know of it; I never saw the prisoner in my life before.
I never sold him any thing in my life.
