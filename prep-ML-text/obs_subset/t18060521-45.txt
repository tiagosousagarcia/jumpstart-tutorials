I am a publican , I live at the Rose and Crown London-house Yard . This day week the prisoner at the bar, and three other men, came into my house, and had something to drink, and after they were gone I missed a great coat, I went to my door, and my neighbour told me that he saw a boy go out with a great coat under his arm, I knew the boy belonged to the prisoner at the bar, I found he lived in a court in Golden-lane; the boy went out first and the men went out afterwards.
What is the prisoner.
A waterman to hackney coachmen; I went to the prisoner's room, and the constable found the duplicate of the coat in his room in a cup.
I am an officer; on Monday night, the 16th of May, I went to the prisoner's lodgings, Bell-alley, Golden-lane, with the prosecutor, I found the duplicate of the coat; I took the prisoner in custody.
I am a pawnbroker; I produce a coat pledged by a woman of the name of Mary Olive , on the 16th of May, for three shillings.
That is my coat.
Do you know who took it out of your house.
No more than a gentleman that lived opposite told me he saw the boy take it out of my house, the boy was his own son; the boy said his father gave it him.
I never had the coat so help me god.
