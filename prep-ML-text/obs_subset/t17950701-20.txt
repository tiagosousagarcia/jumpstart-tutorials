This man, Redman, is employed to take care of the property on board of the Cormandel, by Mr. Perry.
I am employed to take care of the property of Mr. Perry, on board the shop, as a ship keeper; I have been these thirty years under his service; this was the 4th of June, about three o'clock, this Benjamin Darling came on board the ship, and went between decks, near the fore hatch ways, there he see this pile of rope, and dragged it from the fore hatch way, about eighteen feet to the fort, there I watched after him, and he looked after me, and chucked it out of the fort on the land, on the side of the wharf, then immediately I went and took hold of him, and asked him what he did with it, as he did not belong to the ship, and had no right there? he abused me very much.
What is he?
He came in the capicity of a rigger's labourer , not belonging to Mr. Perry, there were riggers on board, rigging of the ship.
Did he give you no reason for taking it?
None at all, only abused me very much.
To Larkin. Are you employed by Messrs. Perry?
Yes, John Perry , senior, John Perry , junior, and Philip Perry . The Cormandel lays in the wet dock under their charge, they are answerable for every thing on board of her.
Where is it, at Blackwall ?
Yes. Prisoner. I was on board the ship, lending the men a hand to turn the stopper, in a ring on the deck, what we made fast the cable to; and the man came up and said that I chucked the rope out of the ship, which I never see the rope at all.
To Redman. What was the quantity of this rope?
Twenty-nine fathoms.
Has it any thing to do with the stopper?
Nothing at all, he had no business on board the ship at all, not did he lend the men a help at all, not was he employed by any body.
