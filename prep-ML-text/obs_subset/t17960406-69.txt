I am a seed and hop-factor : On Monday the 28th, about five o'clock in the afternoon, I delivered 100lb. weight of clover seed to the prisoner in a sack; he was to take it to the Catherine-wheel-inn, in the Borough; I employed him to carry it there; I had two single 100 weights for him to carry; he was to take that and come back for the other, but he did not return; and I went over to enquire if it had been left there; I described the man, and they said there had been no so such person there, nor the goods; I saw nothing of the prisoner again till the 31st of March, when I saw him by the water side, on one of the wharfs between the Custom-house and the Tower; I went home to get a person to go with me; when I returned, I saw the prisoner learning over the rails upon Tower-stairs, looking towards the river; I desired him to come with me to my warehouse, which he did; I sent for a constable, and charged him with it; I asked him what he had done with the seed; he said he did not know any thing of any seed; he went with me very quietly.
Had you ever employed him before?
No.
Are you sure he is the man?
I am perfectly sure of it.
All I have to say is, that I don't know any thing at all about it; I never received any seed from the gentleman.
What might the value of the whole of this be?
7l. 1s.
If you had seen another soldier dressed in the same way like him, you might perhaps have thought it was him?
It was holiday time, and I saw 40 or 50 soldiers when I saw him; he said he did not know any thing of the clover seed, and he told the person with me that he did not know any thing of me.
