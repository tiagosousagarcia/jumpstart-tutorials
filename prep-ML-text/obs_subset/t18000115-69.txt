I am gate-keeper of the King's tobacco-warehouses upon Tower-hill , employed under the Commissioners of the Customs; the prisoner was employed as a cooper : On the 30th of December, about half past three in the afternoon, the prisoner came up to the gate from the cooperage; I searched him, as it is the custom, every time the labourers leave the warehouse they are searched; I searched the prisoner, Alexander Grey was close by me; I searched him and found some leaf-tobacco concealed inside his waistcoat, and some in the crown of his hat withinside the lining; he begged very hard for me to let him go, and I would not do it; and I put him into a little lodge that I had till I could get a constable.
You always search the men?
Yes.
No man could think of escaping?
Impossible.
Sometimes the merchants leave samples, and they do not put them into the cask again?
Not always; but no samples are offered to be taken out without a pass, and he had none.
These samples are the property of the merchants, and not the labourers?
Yes.
I am warehouse-keeper of the King's warehouses upon Tower-hill; I do not know the prisoner; I have the custody of all the tobacco that is lodged for the security of the King's duties.
You are all jointly responsible for this property?
Yes.
There is the surveyor, the comptroller, and yourself?
Yes.
They are jointly responsible with you?
There never has been a case of that kind.
They are under your custody as warehouse-keeper?
Yes.
The prosecutor has spoke very false; I can bring witness to prove that I had no lining in my hat.
