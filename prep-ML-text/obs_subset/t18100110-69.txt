I am shopman to Benjamin Marshall, linen-draper , 316, High Holborn . On the 9th of January the prisoner came into the shop, he asked for a quarter of a yard of callico, I served him; he went out and came in again in about ten minutes, and asked for a quarter of a yard of finer callico; I was serving a customer, I perceived him getting some print under his waistcoat; I was going to speak to Mr. Marshall about it, and before I got to him the prisoner ran out of the shop; I pursued him and stopped him in Southampton-court; he went down in a cellar; I said hold him, I never lost sight of him. He pulled the print from under his waistcoat and threw it behind a screen; I brought him back to the shop, Mr. Marshall pulled off his hat, these was a yard and a half of callico in it; I knew the print; I would not swear to the caliico; I supposed it was ours. I picked up the print and delivered it to the constable.
If you please to forgive me this time I will never be guilty of the like again.
