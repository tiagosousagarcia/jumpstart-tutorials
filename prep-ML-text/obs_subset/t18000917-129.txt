I am servant to David Pitcairn , baker , in Guildford-Street, Foundling-hospital: On the 9th of this month, I put down my basket, and went a little distance to deliver a loaf; when I came back, the prisoner was brought to me with four loaves of bread.
I am a baker: On the 9th of September, I saw the prisoner run across Guildford-Street, with four loaves from a basket; I put my basket down, and ran after him; I told him to put the bread back to where he took it from; he said, he would, if I would not meddle with him; he then said, he would not carry them at all, and he threw them down.
The loaves that were shewn me, were my master's property; they had his name upon them, D. P.
I took charge of the prisoner.
I saw these four loaves standing upon a step, and I took them; Mr. Longden can give me a character.
I have had him seven times in the House of Correction for running away from his master.
