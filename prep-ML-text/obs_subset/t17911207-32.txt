I lost a linen gown, and two half cotton shawls; a pair of linen sheets were lost off the apprentice's bed; I had seen them an hour before they were stolen; I saw the woman go down stairs with them; I ran after her, and catched her in the next street; I never lost sight of her; she said that a young man had sent her for the sheets to wash; she had them loose in her apron; I can swear to all the articles.
