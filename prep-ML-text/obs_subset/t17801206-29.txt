The prisoner brought two baskets of wood to my house on the 26th of October, about a quarter after five in the evening; he brought them into the front room and set them down; about three or four minutes after he was gone out of the house my wife called me down stairs. I missed two silver watch cases and one tortoiseshell with silver edges, which had been lying upon the dresser. They have never been found.
The prisoner came to our house with wood on the 26th of October, I let him in. Immediately after he went I missed the watch cases; I had them in my hand when I was cheapening the wood, and had laid them down on the corner of the dresser. I missed the cases before any other person came into the house; when he was in the room with the wood I turned my back to go to the bottom of the stairs, but I was never out of the room while he was there. I went to the prisoner's house and waited for his coming home. Upon being charged with this matter he persisted in his innocence.
