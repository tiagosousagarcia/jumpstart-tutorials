I lodge at the Ship, in Finsbury-place , I am a coachman ; On the 5th of October, I lost my half-boots out of my bed-room; the prisoner was at work as a bricklayer's labourer upon the roof of the house; in a day or two after, in consequence of information, I went after the prisoner, and took him with my half-boots upon his feet. - (The half-boots were produced, and identified by the prosecutor.)
Did you sell him those boots?
No; the prisoner was my labourer; I was at work at the house.
I am a servant out of place.
What do you know about these boots?
I saw the prisoner pay for a pair of boots at a public-house, where I was having a pint of beer.
When was it?
I cannot rightly say what day.
What month?
I really cannot say.
How long have you known the prisoner?
Near twelve months.
Did you live with him?
No, he lived about three doors from me.
Did he live there the last twelve months before he was taken up?
Yes.
Which of those two men was it?
I think I saw the further one (the prosecutor) sitting there drinking; I don't know the other man.
I have known Ballantine for twenty years.
Is he a likely man to perjure himself?
I should think not.
