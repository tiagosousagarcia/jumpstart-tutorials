I am a labouring man at a potter smiths ; I know the prisoner; I live at Norton Falgate ; I lost the things mentioned in the indictment on the 7th of December; there were four men lodged in the room where they were, so I cannot tell which it is; I cannot tell all their sirnames; I know their Christian names; the prisoner was one; they all came home but Raisbeck, some about seven, and some about eight; on that Friday evening he came, not that night; I missed the things in the morning after they went out.
I am wife of the last witness; I missed the things on Friday morning before Christmas; all the other lodgers came home but him; and he came in a fortnight for a shirt, and I told him I should take him before Justice Wilmot, and he owned where he had pledged them; he sent his master, who is a taylor, for his shirt and stockings that I had to wash, and I would not let him have them unless he came himself; so that made him come; I told the master I had lost some things, and wished to see Raesback; and his master said, he would go and fetch him; he came with his master; he said, would I hurt him if he owned to them; I said, I would not hurt him; he promised to come on Saturday, and did not; and my husband gave charge of him on Sunday; I found the things by his owning them.
