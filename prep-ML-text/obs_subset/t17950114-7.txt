I am a coach-maker ; I live in Whitechapel . I know the things were taken out of pawn.
When did you see them last before they were stole?
I suppose not for a month, they were kept in a drawer.
Are you a married man?
Yes.
When had you seen this property the last time before it was stole?
I had not seen it for some time. The waistcoat my husband very seldom wore it; I suppose I had not seen it for a month or five weeks.
Who found the duplicates?
The patrol.
Was the prisoner at the bar in your service?
Yes, but she had left the service about seven months.
Did you miss these things after she left your service?
Yes.
You did not examine her box when she left your service?
She had none.
I am a patrol; I took the prisoner in a house in Whitechapel, Mr. Shellard's, a stocking shop. I searched her at the watch-house, I found nothing then. The next day in the morning, I found two duplicates in the watch-house.
Had there been any other prisoner there, besides the prisoner at the bar?
I cannot tell that.
You found two duplicates there?
Yes, of two flat irons and a shirt.
I am a pawnbroker.
Do you know the prisoner at the bar?
I cannot say positively; I have seen her at the shop more than once or twice; I cannot positively swear to her, that she pawned these things.
