On the 28th of April, the deceased ( John Weir ) and I went on board the Bombay-Castle ; James King and his father came on board: after that, I heard the deceased say to King, What, gallows! King said, What, York! - Weir being a Yorkshire-man. I took very little notice till I saw the deceased strike at King's legs, and set him down on his backside on the quarter-deck; it appeared to me to look serious; I took more notice; King got up, and they both took their jackets off.
Did you hear any thing before King got up?
Yes; I saw him strike him a slap on the face with his open hand: upon that they instantly stripped, and went to fighting.
Did Weir return the blow before they stripped?
I can't be positive, whether before or afterwards; they stripped instantly, and sought; King fell down; he rose, and they made several closes; I cannot say how many; there were several bouts, and several falls.
Which appeared to have the better in the fight?
I can't say which had the better; King fell three or four times, and Weir fell three or four times; the last fall, they went both down together; I don't know positively which was next the deck.
Did they fall over any thing?
No; on the flat deck. Upon the last fall, I put my hands round Weir to take him up; he put his head back, and gave one single groan, and departed.
In what manner did King behave, upon that?
He appeared to be very serious, when he saw what the circumstances were like to turn to.
Was he a good deal concerned?
Yes.
Was he much hurt?
I don't know upon my word.
