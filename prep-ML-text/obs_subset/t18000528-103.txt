I keep the Nag's-head at Enfield ; the prisoner was quartered in my house; and on Friday night, the 25th of April, between nine and ten o'clock, he went away; I know nothing of the loss.
I am one of the patrol belonging to Bow-street: Between twelve and one o'clock at night on the 25th of April, I was standind at the corner of the Angel at Islington, when a man came past me with a bundle in his right hand, and these three plates upon his left arm; I ran up to him and stopped him; I asked him, what are you doing with those plates; he said, they are my own; I asked him how he came by them, and he said he bought them of a man at Enfield; I asked him who, and he could not tell me.
These are my plates; they are marked J A C, and J M C.
I was quartered in Mr. Clarke's house; I belong to the Tower Hamlets militia; I bought these plates of a man that was there; and having heard there was to be no parade the next day, and as I have a family, I came to London to do a day's work, as I always do whenever I can; and I was stopped at Islington.
