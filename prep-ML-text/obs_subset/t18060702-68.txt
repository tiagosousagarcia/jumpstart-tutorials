On Sunday evening the 8th of June, about half past nine o'clock, I felt something at my left coat pocket, I immediately put my hand round and caught hold of the prisoner.
Where was his hand.
In my coat pocket; I took him to Bow-street, he had not taken any thing out, my handkerchief was only half out.
