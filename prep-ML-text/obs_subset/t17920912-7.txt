I am servant to Mr. Fitzhugh, we lost four silver forks and two spoons, on the 4th of September, they were in the pantry, I saw the prisoner take them about twelve o'clock, I shut the door upon him, and took him, he took them out of his bosom, and laid them on the table.
I was going to see an acquaintance who lived at next door, and I mistook one area for the other, and this young man came, and shut me in; I never saw the spoons.
