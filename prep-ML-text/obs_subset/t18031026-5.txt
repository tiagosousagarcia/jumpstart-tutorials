- I am a labourer ; I was employed at the Bank by Mr. Nelson, a stone mason, the prisoner was employed by him also, and has been for some years: In consequence of suspicion, on the 6th of October I watched the prisoner; the labourers were coming out of the Bank, facing Founders-hall-court, in Lothbury; I followed him, with Smith, a constable, up Basinghall-street, across Fore-street, into Moor-lane, where there is a back-door to an old-ironshop, in Grub-street; he went in there, and Smith and I followed him in, and found a lump of lead in his breeches in the back room, it weighed 23lb.
I am a constable; I went with the last witness from the Bank to Grub-street, where the prisoner went in by a back-door; I went in, searched the prisoner, and found under the waistband of his breeches 23lb. of lead; it was then quite warm; the prisoner tried to prevail upon me to go home with him, and he would settle it in a better manner.
I am a labourer; I was employed at the Bank.
I found the lead in Lothbury, in the Bank-buildings.
