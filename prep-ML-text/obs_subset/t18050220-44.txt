What is your husband's name?
John Rawlins ; he lives in Maidenhead-court, Aldersgate-street ; he keeps a clothes shop .
In that shop were there any lines across the window?
Yes, several, with clothes hanging on them.
Was there a brown coat hanging on one of these lines?
Yes, on the 15th of this month, I was sitting in the parlour; I was alarmed; I thought I heard a rumbling in the shop; my husband was sitting along with me; I got up, and went into the passage; I saw a person go out with a bundle.
That was not the prisoner?
No, I saw the prisoner in the shop, with the coat in his hand; when he saw me, he dropped it down on the chair, and came out of the room, and I caught hold of him in the passage; I called for my husband; then he was taken into custody, and taken before a Magistrate, and brought here; the other man had gone away with a variety of articles.
You are the husband of the last witness?
Yes; I came to her assistance, and saw her have hold of the prisoner; I produce the coat; it is my coat.
Is that the coat you saw the man drop?
It is.
Had he ever offered to purchase the coat after he was detected?
He said nothing at all about it.
