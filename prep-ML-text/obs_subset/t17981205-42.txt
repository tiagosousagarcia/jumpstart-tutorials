I live in New Peter-street, Westminster . Two months ago last Monday, I let the prisoner a lodging up two pair of stairs for four weeks; I let them to her by the week, at 2s. 6d. a week; she quitted the lodging at the four weeks' end, and out of the four weeks she paid me three; she went away clandestinely on the Monday, and I did not find her till the Thursday following; I then made her come home with me and open her door; I then missed the things mentioned in the indictment, I found them again at the pawnbroker's.
I am a widow, left with one child; I hope the pawnbroker will shew me a little partiality.
