I am a preferable watchman belonging to his Majesty's Board of Customs: On the 19th of August I was upon duty at Freshwharf ; between seven and eight o'clock in the evening, John Worsham , a watchman belonging to the India Company, called to me, and in consequence of his information, I went and took the prisoner; I found him sitting upon a bag of cotton; I brought him forward, and a police-officer was sent for, and he took a quantity of cotton out of his breeches.
Whose was it?
The merchant is unknown; I had it in charge; it belonged to different merchants.
I am a labourer belonging to the India Company: On Tuesday, the 19th of August, about half past seven, I saw the prisoner taking the cotton out of a bag upon Freshwharf, and putting it in his breeches; I called to the watchman, Todd, and he came and took hold of him; I charged him with it, and he said he had got none about him, till he was searched, and part of it taken out, and then he denied that he had any more; we found a quantity more upon him, and then he was secured, and taken to the Compter.
I am a constable:(Produces the cotton.)
I was starving, and very much distrest; I never did such a thing before; I have not a farthing in the world; I did not know what to do with it when I had got it.
