- I am a shoemaker , in Holborn : Between two and three o'clock on the 24th of July, I lost four pair of shoes; I was crossing nearly opposite my own door, and saw my wife following the prisoner; she and I came nearly up to her at the same time, and I took these four pair of shoes out of her apron. (Produces them) ; I asked her no questions, for I saw the shoes in her apron; I took her before a Magistrate; they have my private mark upon them.
I was so much in liquor, that I did not know what I was doing.
Did she appear to be in liquor?
I did not think she was.
I am the wife of the last witness; I was in the adjoining room to the shop, and saw the prisoner come into the shop; it was nearly three o'clock in the afternoon; she took three pair of shoes first, and put them into her apron; she took them from the inside of the window; she then took a fourth pair, and ran out; I followed her, and Mr. Byrne came up; I told him the woman had taken them; he took them out of her apron, and brought her back into the shop, tied up the shoes with a string, and went with her to Bow-street.
Was she in liquor?
She might be; I did not take particular notice; but I do not think she was.
