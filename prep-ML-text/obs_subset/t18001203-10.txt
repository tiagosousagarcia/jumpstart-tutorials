- I am a mercer in Bread-street : The prisoner was recommended to me by a country correspondent to get him into a situation, and from the extraordinary character that I had of him, I was induced to take him to feed at my table; he has been with me about three weeks; I did not see him take the property; but in consequence of some suspicions and information from my servants, on Saturday the 22d of this month, I challenged him directly with having robbed me of a yard and a half of florentine silk; upon my charging him with it, he denied it, but I persisted in it, and made use of some threats.
You must not tell us any thing that he said after that?
I saw the property at the pawnbroker's afterwards.
- I am servant to a pawnbroker in Watling-street; here is a shawl that I took in of the prisoner on the 18th of November, and a yard and a half of silk, (produces them) he told me he had bought the silk to make him a waistcoat.
Are you sure of the prisoner'sperson?
Yes. Mr. Sampson. The shawl I cannot attempt to swear to; it is an article that no man can swear to; the piece of silk would be in that situation, but unfortunately for the prisoner, it is cut away, and the piece that is at home corresponds exactly with this.
Did you miss a shawl?
It would have been impossible for me to have missed twenty dozen if they had been gone; it is of the same resemblance and make with other goods that I have in the house.
My Lord, if gentlemen of respectability to speak in my behalf, could be of service to me, I could have had them to-morrow, but to day they are not here; every person with whom I have had dealings would give me the most irreproachable character; and if other pieces of silk were cut away, they might tally with Mr. Sampson's, as well as this; my friends are three hundred miles from town, and are, I am proud to say, of the, first respectability in their neighbourhood; I served my time regularly in the county of Cornwall, and had a liberal education. NOT GUILTY .
