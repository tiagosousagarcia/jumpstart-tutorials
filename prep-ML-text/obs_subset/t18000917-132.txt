I am clerk to Messrs. Dixon and Son, both their names are William: On Monday last, in consequence of information, I went out into Foster-lane , and called out stop thief, upon which I saw the prisoner run, and throw the boot down; I pursued him into Horse-shoe-passage, close by where he was taken; I saw the boot picked up by the apprentice of a shoemaker in St. Martin's-le- grand, and given to another person, by whom it was brought back.
I am servant to Mr. Dixon: I saw the prisoner drop the boot; Mr. Meadows's apprentice picked it up and delivered it to me; I gave it to Mr. Morris, and it was delivered to the constable.
The poor fellow was a little the worse for liquor, was not he?
I cannot say whether he was or not.
I had been drinking a little, and was very sick; I turned into the court on that account, and this gentleman came and challenged me with taking the boot.
Examined by Mr. Alley. I was executor to the Will of the prisoner's father; I had paid him his legacy that very day, about half past eleven o'clock.
Was he sober?
He did not appear to me to be intoxicated; we had three shillingsworth of brandy and water among five of us, and he had had something at the public-house before we met; the prisoner is a shoemaker, and has borne a good character all his life.
