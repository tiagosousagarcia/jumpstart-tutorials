Where is your house?
Where did you find it at last?
In her pockets; I found the muslinet in one pocket, and this piece of printed cotton in the other; her pockets were put back behind her shoulders, she had two long great pockets; I know the cotton by the pattern, and I know the muslinet by the shop mark; it is Mr. Craig's property.
My sister and I went to this place, to buy a couple of muslin gowns, to the first thing that she bargained for, was a bit of muslin, and a bit of callico to make a petticoat, and she told me when she got change that she would buy them, and pay for them; on that account when I see her paying for the gowns, I took them up and put them into my pocket.
Did the sister pay for what she had?
Yes, and carried away what she paid for; I believe this to be a very old offender.
