I am clerk to John and Abraham Atkins . On the 6th of October, Mr. Saxton and the officer called upon me, in consequence of which we went on board the ship Sarah, and upon examination found 12lb. deficient in one box, and in another 38lb.; it was marked and labelled in the same manner as that which was found upon the prisoner. I saw it at the office afterwards.
How many pounds of powder were found?
Ten pounds.
You don't mean to swear that that is the powder you lost?
No.
And it was four or five days after you had shipped it, before you missed it?
Yes.
The prisoner was at work for me, on board the ship, all that day, the 5th of October.
I put twenty boxes of powder on board the ship Sarah.
On the 5th of October, going up East Smithfield I met the prisoner, he crossed the way, and I followed him and took the powder from him.
This was at noon-day?
Yes.
It was not at all concealed?
No.
