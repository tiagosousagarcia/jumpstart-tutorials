I am a widow, I live at Chelsea ; I lost the things mentioned in the indictment, (repeating them;) I lost them out of my back room; on Thursday the 13th of February, when I came home to dinner at one o'clock, I saw my gowns hanging up, and I left them there when I went out again to work at two; I came home between five and six in the evening from my work, I found the key on the outside, and the door locked; I had left the prisoner in the room; she had lodged with me from the 9th; I opened the door, and immediately missed my gowns, and the other things from my drawers; I never saw her again till I took her myself under the Physic-walls, and delivered her to the constable, his name is Grubb.
I am a pawnbroker in Brydge's-street, Covent-garden, (produces a black silk clock, and a cotton gown;) I took them in of the prisoner, in the name of Ann Friday ; I am not certain that I had ever seen her before, but I saw her twice that day, they were pledged separately; I produced them at Queen-square Police-office, and there I saw her again, she said they were her own property; I lent her nine shillings on the cloak, and five shillings on the gown.
I took the things.
