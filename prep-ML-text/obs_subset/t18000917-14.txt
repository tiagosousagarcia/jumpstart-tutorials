I manage the business for James Gascoigne, Thomas Dawson, and James Dixon , the proprietors of Porters-Quay , they are the lessees of the wharf: On the 28th of August. I was in the accompting-house, I heard an alarm, I went down upon the Quay, and found one of our gangsman with the prisoner in custody; at the time that I saw him, he had five feet of iron chain, with two can-hooks, upon him, belonging to Messers. Gascoigne, Dawson, and Dixon; I know them by the mark, and by the make of them, they were marked P K for Porters Key; I can swear positively to them.
I am a gangsman at Porters-Quay: On the 28th of August, I saw the prisoner come out of the warehouse, I thought he had something upon him; he walked a little way with something under his jacket; I went up to him and asked him what he had got there; he said, nothing; I told him I would see what he had got; he was very loth to me, but I opened his jacket, and there I found the chain; I then took him to Mr. Lacey, the constable, and gave charge of him; I delivered the chain with him.( John Lacey , the constable produced the property, which was deposed to by Chapman).
A man engaged four of us to go to a job, and sent me back for a pair of canhooks; I saw them lying at the warehouse door, I took them up, and put them under my arm, and this gentleman laid hold of me; I had no intention of stealing them.
