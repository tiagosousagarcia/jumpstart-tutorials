- I keep the Whitebear, Piccadilly , the prisoner was in my service, and had been about five or six months: On Saturday, the 8th of November, I missed two shillings out of the till; on the Sunday, I missed another shilling; and in consequence of that, I marked some silver in the till; I marked 2l. 13s. in shillings, and two half-crowns; I put them into the till again; on Monday I examined, and they were all safe; I put them in again on Monday evening; I found them right again on Tuesday morning; on Tuesday, about eleven or twelve o'clock, I put them in again; on the Wednesday morning between nine and ten, I took them out and counted them, and found five shillings deficient; I sent to Bow-street for an officer; Mr. Miller came, and searched first the waiter, there was nothing found on him; he then searched the prisoner, and out of the money that was found upon her, I picked out four of the shillings that I had marked, they are marked upon the edge, with the top part of the letter R. I have no doubt of their being mine; Miller also found upon her a key, which opened the till and locked it again; and when I had locked it with that key, I found it exactly in the same way that I had found it after I had been robbed, for the right key required to be turned again before it would open; it is the key of her box.
I am an officer belonging to Bow-street: On Wednesday, the 12th of November, I apprehended the prisoner, she turned out the contents of her pocket, and out of the silver, Mr. Clemmitt picked out the four shillings that he has produced; I tried a key that I found upon her, which unlocked the till in the way that he has described.
I have nothing to say, but to claim the mercy of the Court.
