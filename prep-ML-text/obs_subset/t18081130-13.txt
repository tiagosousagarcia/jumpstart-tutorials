I am a servant to Mr. Martin, at Enfield . On the 14th of October, I left my watch in my breeches, hanging up in the stable; I locked the stable door, and left the key in the door, at about half past one; I returned at about half past four; I missed my watch. On the 20th of October, when the prisoner was apprehended, I saw him deliver it to the constable.
The watch that the constable shewed you was the watch you left in the stable on the day you have been describing
It is.
Were you sent for to apprehend the prisoner
Yes; I apprehended him at his master's stable; the prisoner went with me to his room, he unlocked the box himself; I found this watch in his box; I asked him how he came to steal the watch; the prosecutor told him it would be better for him to confess.
Then do not tell what he said
I took him to Enfield; the lock was off the watchhouse door, I took him to the Nag's Head; he sat very quietly with me; as soon as the smith had put the lock on and brought me the key, I took him out to put him in the watchhouse; he broke from me as soon as he got out of the public house door; he kept away for five or six week; he was taken last Saturday; he is the same man, he has a wife and two children.
Were you in Mr. Martin's house on the 14th of October
I was at work on the premises; the prisoner came there with a load of straw. I found the prisoner in the stable; the waggon was drawn up to the stable door.
