I live with Mr. James Swallow , hatter , No. 62, St. James's-street : On Monday, the 25th of February, my master left me in care of the shop; about six o'clock the prisoner stood lurking about the door, and looking at me, but I did not think he had any intention of taking any thing; in a few minutes afterwards the prisoner came in, and asked me for a penny lace for his boot; I told him we did not sell any; seeing him a poor boy, I thought I would give him a bit of old hat-binding, and save him his penny, which I did; he thanked me, and went out, and I went on with my work again; a few minutes afterwards I thought I heard somebody come within the step of the door, and I thought I saw the prisoner's hat through the window of the door, as if he was looking to see if I sat there; that gave me some suspicion that he wanted to take something; I dropped down on my hands and knees on the finishing-block behind the door; then the prisoner came creeping in slyly, and caught hold of this hat from the counter, and was carrying it off.
How far was he carrying it off?
About two yards from the place where the hat was, he was still in the shop; I got up, and caught hold of him by the collar, and asked him what he was at; he dropped the hat, and began crying; I called out to Miss Swallow, my master's sister, who was in the next parlour; she locked both doors, and went up stairs to call a gentleman; at the time she was gone, he asked me to speak as well as I could for him; I held the boy till the gentleman came down; then he secured him till I went and fetched a constable; I am certain that is the boy, and this is my master's hat.
I went in for a penny lace; he told me he did not sell any; with that he called me back; he said, as I looked like a poor boy , he would give me a bit of hat-binding, and he gave me a little better than half a yard; I went in again with the penny in my hand, and said, if you please will you give a little bit more of that binding for a penny; he jumped up to get it, and knocked the hat down; I picked it up; then he came and caught hold of me.
Are you sure you saw the boy take the hat from where it was?
I am sure I saw him take it.
