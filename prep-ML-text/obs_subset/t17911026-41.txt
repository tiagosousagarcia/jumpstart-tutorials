I was alarmed of the robbery, I went to the door, I could not see any person, I turned back to the window to see the state of it; I had not been there more than a minute before a mob of people came back with the prisoner, in custody of an officer and a runner.
I saw the prisoner take the ribbon from the basket where it hung over the line for shew, he took away one piece. I am sure to the prisoner.
I am one of the patrols, I took the prisoner with the ribbon, he was walking fast.
I had been on some business for my father and mother, and they took me; the man run by me, and had liked to have knocked me down, and that good man picked the ribbon off the ground.
