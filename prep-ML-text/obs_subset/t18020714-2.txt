I am gangsman, at Galley-quay , in partnership with the other persons named in the indictment, (repeating their names;) on Friday last, the 9th of July, I was landing some elephant's teeth from a ship, called the Union; after having landed a quantity, we placed them at a distance from the scale, and set a man to watch; I did not see the prisoner take it; the weigher saw the prisoner go up the gate-way, with a tooth, and followed him.
Are you, as gangsman, responsible for these elephants' teeth?
We are; I saw the prisoner brought back by the weigher, with the tooth.
I am weighter at Galley-quay; I saw the prisoner take up the tooth, put it under his jacket, and walk away up the gateway, towards Thames-street; I followed him, and caught hold of him, he immediately threw it down; I saw one of my partners take it up, he is not here; it was given to the constable, Mr. Green.
I am a constable, (produces the tooth;) Green is ill, and could not come; he delivered this tooth to me about two minutes after the robbery; I have had it ever since, there is a mark upon it that the gangsman can swear to it by.
This is the same tooth, it has the ship mark and tvhe number upon it.
I was at work at the Customhouse, and after being paid off, I was going up the gateway, and was counting my money, when he said hold of me; I never had the tooth in my possession at all.
