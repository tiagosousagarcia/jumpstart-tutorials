I am the wife of Philip Baldwin. Last Thursday I lost the things named in the indictment; I left them in the house for a quarter of an hour, and when I came back again, the prisoner was gone with the property.
I saw the prisoner go out with the things about three o'clock, and I followed her across the fields; I desired her to stop and throw the things down, she said she had nothing, and I followed her till she did throw them down.
I did it from necessity and want.
