I am the wife of James Elliot , baker , Bostock-street, Old Gravel-lane : The first time I ever saw the prisoner was the 27th of April, I saw him come out of the next house; and on the 29th, a little after four o'clock, I saw him come out of my house with his hands in his bosom; I came home immediately, and missed my handkerchiefs; he went off; my husband was in the yard; I had left the handkerchiefs upon the table about a quarter of an hour before; I left nobody in the room when I went out; I saw the prisoner again about half an hour afterwards; I told him he had taken my handkerchiefs; he said he had not; I said he had one of them round his neck, and he took it off and gave it me; (produces it;) he said he had pawned the other, and gave me the duplicate of it; this handkerchief I know to be mine, by a hole I tore by a pin.
She said she would send me to jail if I did not give her the handkerchief.
I did not say any such thing.
I am servant to John Mashiter , a pawnbroker, No. 16, Ratcliff-highway: On the 29th of April I took in this handkerchief from the prisoner for three shillings; this is the duplicate I gave to the prisoner.
This is my handkerchief, I know it by the hem; it is my own work; here is some of the silk that I left upon it; I am positive it is my own.
How far is it from the prosecutrix's to your house?
Five or six minutes walk; not more.
I was coming down Ratcliff-highway; I met with a sailor ; he said, shipmate, where are you going; I told him I was going on board my own ship; he said he was going to Portsmouth, and he would give me a pot or two of beer if I would go to the pawnbroker's, and pawn this handkerchief for him; I told him he might go him self; he said he did not like to go into a pawnbroker's shop, there were always so many women there; and I bought them of him, and pawned one of them; I gave him the money for both of them.
