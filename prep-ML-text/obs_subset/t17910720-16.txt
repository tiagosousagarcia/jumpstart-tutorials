I lost two dimity petticoats and a pair of cotton stockings out of a garden just by the house where I live, at Highgate ; they had been put in about an hour before I missed them; I did not see them taken away, but I saw a person going out of the garden, and sent Thomas Robinson after her, and they brought her back; I had seen the person sitting in the road for two hours before, near the garden; the things were hung up on a line. I missed the things, and saw her going, in a quarter of an hour she was brought back, and taken to the constable, with the property upon her.
Last Thursday week, about one or two o'clock, I was called to run after a woman who had robbed Mrs. Collingbridge; I found she was stopped, before I came up, by Mr. Prosser; I took her to the constable, and he took from her the things; she had the things wrapped up in a blue cloak before her.
I was crossing the road and saw Mr. Robinson running, and heard him say, stop the woman, and I turned her cloak on one side, and saw the things; I took the things from her, and gave her, when Mr. Robinson came up, into his custody.
I am the constable; the prisoner, and two petticoats, and a pair of stockings, were delivered to me on the 14th of July, and have been in my custody ever since.
As I was going along tired and hungry, looking for my husband, who left me ten weeks ago, being tired and hungry much, I could not get on, and one of these men came up and asked me what I sat there for; I told him; he told me he would give me some victuals, and he came back to take me to his own house, and put an handkerchief round my neck to hang me; and he did his best to get the better of me; and he said, if I would not let him do it, he would put me into a tub of water and drown me, and so I bawled out, and he gave me these things into my apron; and those people ran after me.
