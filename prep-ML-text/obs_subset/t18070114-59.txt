I am a fruiterer and green grocer , I live at No. 6, White-lion street, Whitechapel. On the 8th of December, between the hours of ten and eleven o'clock at night, from information I went to the end of the street, and round the corner, about thirty yards, I saw the prisoner standing at the end of the court, I did not perceive any thing with her at the time, I heard some water spill, I immediately ran to her and caught her by the shoulder, she immediately dropped down the tub and the oysters before her; she exclaimed, you wicked man, she said there is the man, he ran before me and dropped the oysters, I said, there is no person ran before you, there is no person nigh; the tub was close to her. It was my tub, I valued it at one shilling, and the oysters at three shillings.
Do you know any thing of this prisoner taking the tub and the oysters.
Yes, I was fetching three or four pails of water, I saw a woman take the tub and the oysters. I went over directly and told Mr. Ballance. I saw the woman afterwards, it is the same woman.
I am an innocent woman, I never saw the oysters in my life.
