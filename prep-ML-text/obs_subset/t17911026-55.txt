I am a carpenter by trade, I lost a toilinet waistcoat, the 17th of October, from my lodgings; I saw it there the evening before; I did not miss it till the evening, when I came home to bed; I accused the prisoner of it, and he owned it; he lodged with me, he staid one night after; I said nothing to him to induce him to confess. The duplicate was found in his pocket, I was present.
My father is a pawnbroker, the prisoner pledged this waistcoat with my father.
I told him of it, and he said I might.
