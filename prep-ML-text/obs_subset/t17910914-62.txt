Last Monday was a week I lost a little boy, and went out to look after him, and when I came back I met Mary Hughes coming out of my entry with a gown in her apron. I live in Crown-court, Short's-gardens . I charged the constable with her, and the gown being wet, I had it to dry, and have kept it ever since; I had thrown it over a line to dry.
I know nothing about it.
This woman gave me charge of the prisoner.
