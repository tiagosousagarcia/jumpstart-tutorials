I am a bookseller , No. 1, Long-lane ; I have a shelf at each of my windows fastened into the wood work: On Thursday last, between six and seven o'clock in the evening, I saw the prisoner loitering about the window; having repeatedly lost books, I had a suspicion of him; I got right behind the partition in the shop, which had a window in it; I saw him make a push; I went after him; he had got about ten or a dozen yards; I laid hold of him, and took from his bosom two books, which I knew to be mine; they were both printed bound books, one of them was an Abridgement of the History of the Bible, the other was a Prayer Book; they were both marked two shillings and sixpence with a pencil, with my own hand; I had put them out at the door myself in the morning; they were fastened with a string; they could not have been taken out without the string being removed.
I was going along to work; I saw these two books lying; I thought I might as well have them as any body else; I picked them up, and put them in my bosom; my poor mother has been blind these six years; I have worked very hard to keep her as well as I could; I never did such a thing in my life.
