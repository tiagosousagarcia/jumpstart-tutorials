I am a watchman employed by the London-Dock Company, the prisoner was one of their labourer s: About six o'clock in the evening of the 31st of October, I saw the prisoner come out of the coffer-dam, and about one hundred others; I stood as near them as I could, to see they took nothing out; the prisoner and another came up abreast of one another; I suspected them, and gave them in charge to Burton, and they were taken to the watch-house; the prisoner was searched, and an iron bolt and dog were taken from him; the bolt from between the waistband of his breeches and under his waistcoat.
Was the dog fixed to the building or not?
It is moveable, but is driven into the ground; it is crooked at each end, to brace two logs to keep the piles even as they are driven down, and is moveable from one pile to another.
I searched the prisoner, and found this iron on him, one on one side, and the other on the other, under his waistcoat. (Produces them.)
I am store-keeper of the London-Dock Company; these irons have the Company's mark.
I have nothing to say.
