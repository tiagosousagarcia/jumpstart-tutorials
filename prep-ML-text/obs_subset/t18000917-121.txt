I am the wife of Abraham Mottier : I keep a public-house in Brewer-Street, Golden Square ; I employed the prisoner at the bar, as a chairwoman , for about nine months, and, at different times, missed a great quantity of wearing apparel, and household linen; I had not the least suspicion of the prisoner; I discharged two maids, not telling them what I discharged them for, in order to find out the thief; on the 11th of September, I accused the prisoner with taking my property, and on her person I found, in her pocket, tea, sugar, salt, and an apron; I immediately sent to Marlborough-Street, for an officer; I gave charge of her, and went with the officer to her lodgings, where I found a pair of stockings with my mark upon them, that she had taken away the day before, they were wet, a clout, three knives and three forks, and seventy-nine duplicates, which led to the discovery of the property in the indictment; the pawnbrokers delivered me a great quantity of things at Marlborough-Street, that are not in the indictment.
This poor woman, I believe, up to this time, has maintained a very good character?
Yes.
I am a pawnbroker, servant to Mr. Turner, in Panton-Street, (produces a table-cloth and a shirt); I took them in of the prisoner at the bar: I have known her pledging and redeeming things for twelve years; I never heard any thing amiss of her before.
I live with Mr. Charino, pawnbroker, Broad Sanctuary, (produces two sheets, a table-cloth, four pillow cases, and a handkerchief); I took them in of the prisoner.
They are all marked with my own name.
