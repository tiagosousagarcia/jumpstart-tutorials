I am an upholsterer and cabinet-maker , No. 24, Dover-street . On Wednesday, the 16th of this month, I stopped the prisoner in Dover-street, about a quarter past nine; he had a bundle under his arm; I asked him where he was going; I knew him; he said, to the washerwoman's with foul linen; I laid hold of the bundle, and found it weighty; and I desired him to come back with me; he accordingly came back to my shop; and he shewed me the half hundred weight wrapped up in his foul shirt; I had him taken into custody; the prisoner is my servant as a porter; he has lived with me about seven months; it was about twenty yards from my own door, where I stopped him; the weight was in my shop: (the weight produced): I had no other lead weight but this; the prisoner acknowledged the fact as soon as he came into the shop; I had made no promises or threats; I had lost things before, and I was determined to watch.
You swear to it by a hole?
Yes.
Do not you know that this man had taken this weight to throw with another person for a bet?
No.
You had a good character with him?
Yes.
What is the value of the weight?
I have valued it at six shillings; I never doubted his honesty before.
I did not tell my master I stole it.
