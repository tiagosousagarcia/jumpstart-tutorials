I live in Rosemary-lane , I sell bacon : Last Saturday was a week, between seven and eight o'clock, I saw the prisoner come into the shop, and put a piece of bacon under her cloak; I called out stop thief; Mary Barrett was shutting the shop window, and she stopped her with the bacon.
I was fastening the window, and heard Mr. Burke cry, stop thief; I took hold of the prisoner, and brought her back; Mrs. Burke took the bacon from her.
I took the bacon out of her apron; it is our bacon.
I had been three days and three nights, without breaking my fast, and could not get any thing to do.
