- I am a wine-merchant , in Savage-gardens , in partnership with Charles Dickinson , and James Brett ; the prisoner was employed by a servant of ours to assist in bottling port wine.
I am a victualler, in Cooper's-row, Savage-gardens: On Monday afternoon, the 24th of this month, I heard something fall in the passage, between the outer door and the inner door; I opened the door, and saw the prisoner with two bottles in his hand, and two on the floor, one broke and one not broke; I asked him what he was doing, there was no wine to come here; he said it was an accident; he put the bottles in the window by the bar, and went out at the door; I called a servant to pick the pieces of glass up, and sweep the place out clean; he had been gone but a few minutes, when I heard somebody at the door say to the servant, d-n you, stand out of the way; I went to the door, and observed the prisoner with five bottles more in his hand, he wanted me to let him pack it up; I said he should not pack it there; he then went up Savage-gardens, stopped at No. 22, and spoke to the cellar-man; in about half an hour he came back for the other bottles of wine, and I refused them; he came again, and I still refused them; about seven o'clock Mr. Morgan came to my house, and said his servant had been robbing him of some wine; I told him I had five bottles left with me, which I would not part with till I knew who they belonged to.
I am a cellar-man: I employed the prisoner, on the 24th of this month, to help me bottle a pipe of wine; I was obliged to go out, and when I returned, I thought he was rather in liquor and incapable of packing; I desired he would go, and leave packing, left there should be any misfortune in breaking them; when he went away, I thought I heard the rattling of a bottle; I went after him, and saw him with a bottle on the stairs, which I took from him; the bottles were placed nine in a row, and I missed one row.
This man discharged me, saying I was in liquor; I had a bottle of wine in my hand at the time, and he took it from me.
