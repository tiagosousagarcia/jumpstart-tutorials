I keep the Fish and Crown in Swallow-street : my house was broke open on the 28th of January, on a Thursday, much about half past seven; I was at home, and in the bar.
I am the niece of the prosecutor; I had occasion to go into the parlour to see the fire on the ground floor; and I saw the shade of a man's leg in the back of the house; it opens into the Mews; the curtains were gone, and the sash thrown wide up; they were linen curtains; they were fixed on a line which draws.
When did you last see this window?
About a quarter of an hour before: this was about six o'clock; there was no fastening besides the sash; I only saw the shadow, not the man himself.
I live with Mr. Angle as a servant: I was in Beek-street, on Thursday night, the 28th of January, about a quarter past seven; I saw three men standing; I stood a little while, and saw the curtain in the prisoner's right hand; I never saw him before; I told him he had got my master's curtain, upon which he ran off, and I ran after him; and as he was running, he made a stop, and dropped the curtain in Beek-street; then he ran again, and I followed him till he was taken: soon after the curtain was found in a snuff-shop passage; a woman brought it, and put it into the bar, and away she went directly; it was a red and white curtain; it had figures on it of men, women, and children.
I have one thing to ask him, whether he saw me drop the curtain?
I did not: I turned my head, and found it was out of his hand.
You are very sure he is the man that had the curtain?
Yes, I am.
Going along Beek-street, the boy came up and said something, and I walked on; and they came up and laid hold of me, and took me back to the public-house; but I was never there before.
