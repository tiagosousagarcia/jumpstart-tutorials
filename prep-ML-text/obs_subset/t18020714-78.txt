I am a carpenter and joiner ; the things belong to me, but I know nothing of the stealing them.
I am a carpenter: On the 5th of June I was going to my work in the morning by Mr. Hardingham's door, and saw the prisoner in the area which leads to his shop; I asked her what she did there; she said she went there to make water; while I was discoursing with her; the wind blew her clothes aside, and I saw a plane behind her against the wall; I took it up, and desired her to go away, which she did I opened the window, and put the plane into the shop; I knocked at the door, but could not make any body hear; on my return, I called and told him; he then said he had lost a great number of tools.
On the 5th of June, early in the morning, some planes were pledged at our house in Westminster-bridge-road, by the prisoner, to the best of my recollection; four shillings were lent on them.
On the 5th of June, about four o'clock in the morning, as I was loading my cart, I saw the prisoner go by with a sack on her back, and had rather a suspicion of her; she is an old rag and bone picket in the street; on my return to breakfast. I heard of the robbery, and knowing where she lived, I went to her place, and searched the room, where I found this mallet and gimlet, (produces them) ; I said, old girl, what did you do with the rest of the tools you had in the sack this morning; she said, it was paper; I searched her, and she took something out of her pocket; which she wanted to put into her mouth, but I stopped her, and it appears to be the duplicate of these planes; she wears breeches, and in her breeches pockets I found this book and other duplicates.
As I was going over Westminsterbridge, I asked a man for work, and he said, he wished I would pawn the planes for him, and he would give me 4d. which I did; I went down the area for the purpose the man has stated, but never touched a plane.
