I am a gangsman, a ticket-porter ; the persons named in the indictment are my partners; we are jointly responsible for the goods under our care: On Tuesday the 3d of October last, about four in the afternoon, I detected the prisoner coming out of Chesler's quay with some raw sugar; I detected him, and carried him back to the warehouse door; there might be five or six pounds, I cannot say; he had some in his apron, and some in his hat; he was not employed by me, nor there was not any body at work at that time in that warehouse; the only excuse he made to me was, that he was in liquor, but he did not appear to me so; there was a hogshead standing at the loop-hole, that had the head broke in, and it corresponded with that which he had about him.
I am a constable upon the quays; I was sent for to take charge of the prisoner.
I had no property about me.
