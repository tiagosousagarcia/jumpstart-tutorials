You are a carpenter , and live in St. John-street, Clerkenwell.
Yes, the prisoner at the bar was my journeyman .
Did you on the 27th of May miss any tools.
Yes, I obtained a search warrant, and went to his lodgings in St. John-street, Clerkenwell, and there I found the articles in the indictment, he said before the magistrate he was induced to take the things for the one pound note I refused to let him have.
I am an officer; I searched the premises of the prisoner; I found the property mentioned in the indictment, except a saw pledged at Mr. Page's for five shillings.
(to prosecutor) He applied to you for the loan of a one pound note, and you refused it.
Yes.
I worked with this gentleman above a twelvemonth with my own tools; his tools and my tools I carried all in one in my apron sometimes to my apartment, and as we wanted them we fetched them. we used each other's tools, his tools were nothing to me, I did not want to sell them; he called me from the shop, and this gentleman took me; he said, he had found some tools in my room; he knew at the same time some must be in my apartment; I have done very imprudent, owing to his not lending me the one pound note.
