I am servant to John Britt , a broker : On Thursday, the 8th of this month, between eight and nine in the morning, in consequence of information from Mr. Brown, I followed the prisoner, and overtook her in Leicester-street, with a mahogany table of Mr. Britt's property; I took it from her; she said, take the table, and let me go; I took it; and my master came up, and took her into custody; I had seen the table at my master's.
I keep a grocer's shop in Lisle-street; my house is near the prosecutor's: I saw the prisoner take it on the 8th of July, about nine in the morning.
I am a broker; I followed Sarah Tyler , and took the prisoner; she had my table; I had not sold it to her.
