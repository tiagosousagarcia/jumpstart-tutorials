I live with Captain Bartlett , in Gower-street. I was robbed the 1st of this month, between twelve and one in the day, in Pall-mall ; I was coming along, and staid to see the Welch people come by, and wanted to get out of the way, and this chap here, and two more besides himself, the prisoner caught hold of me, and shoved me against the door, when I found him standing by me, he took out my watch directly, and the other men were behind; he quite involved me, and looked me in the face, and pulled out my watch; I caught hold of him directly and kept him; then all three began beating me, and almost broke my jaw; I cried out, and he was taken. I never saw my watch again; the other two escaped; it was a silver watch gilt.
On the 1st of March, about a quarter before one, we were going with the Welch Society , and I saw the prisoner striking Bartlett, and Bartlett said he had his watch; and I secured him.
I saw no more than Cridland; I searched the prisoner, and found three shillings and sixpence, and a small knife, and twopence farthing; I put him into the watch-house, and then he told Bartlett he should be glad to settle with him concerning the watch, to get his liberty; and so he told me the next morning.
I was coming down Pall-mall, and saw the prisoner strike the black man; that was all I saw; there were three or four people with him; the prisoner said he had a wife and a child or two, and would give him any thing to settle it.
I was coming along, and the black man ran after me, and said I had his watch; he struck me several times, and I shewed my resentment, knowing myself to be innocent.
I am an optician. The prisoner has worked for me upwards of twelve months, he was always an honest, just, true servant; I have often intrusted him to receive small bills.
