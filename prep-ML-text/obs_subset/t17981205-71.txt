I am a carpenter: On the 29th of October, between the hours of one and two, I saw two men plundering a hogshead of sugar up Trigg-wharf , which belongs to Mr. Bolt, they had their hands in the head of it; I drove them away, and Mr. Humphreys, one of the clerks, was standing there, and he brought the prisoner back, who was one of the two, with this quantity of sugar in his coat pockets, (Producing it); I took it out of his pocket, and put it into this bag, there is about four pounds of it; it was loose in his pocket.
I am clerk to Mr. Bolt; I met the prisoner coming up the lane, I suspected he had some sugar about him, and I stopped him; I felt outside his pockets, and finding he had some, I brought him back.
I know nothing of the loss; it is impossible for me to swear to the sugar; I understand he has worked for me several times upon the wharf.
My wife was very ill, and I met a man on the wharf that gave me this sugar; I accepted it, thinking it would be of service to my wife.
