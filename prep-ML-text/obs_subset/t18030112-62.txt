- On the 11th of December , as I was coming up King-street, Drury-lane , I overtook the prisoner at the bar, and knowing he had been transported, I took him into custody.
Was he at large?
Yes, he was walking up King-street; I took him before a Magistrate, he did not give a satisfactory account how he came at large, and Mr. Kirby identified him. - Here is the certificate of his conviction, (produces it) I saw Mr. Shelton sign it. (It is read).
Do you know the prisoner at the bar?
Yes; he was tried here in September Sessions, and ordered to be transported; I delivered him on board the Captivity bulk, I think, on the 9th of October last.
I have nothing say; I am guilty. GUILTY , Death , aged 17.
