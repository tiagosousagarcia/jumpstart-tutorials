I live in Oxford street .
When did you lose this lead.
On the 12th of January it was taken off a place that projected off the house, about ten or eleven feet high.
I am a watchman. I was going my round, and just opposite of this gentleman's house I found this lead, I then looked up to the house, and there I spied the prisoner. I sprang my rattle, he jumped down from off the place; I was not so far from him as I am to you; I pursued him. As soon as he came nigh another watchman he catched him, I never lost sight of him. I told King to mind the man, and I went and fetched the lead; we matched the lead with the place, it is exactly the same.
How did he get up.
I do not know how, I think he must have help. We went back to the place where the prisoner was upon, we found his hat and his knife; the next morning he said the knife and the hat were both his.
I heard the other watchman spring the rattle, and I stopped him.
It was about eleven o'clock when I was coming from my sister's house, when I heard the rattle spring; somebody jumped off from the top, and the lead knocked my hat off.
