I went up in the garret, and saw the prisoner there, on the 1st of February, in the front garret, about nine in the morning; the men came to work in the morning, about six: the door opens by a latch with a brass nob: I do not know whether the door was shut or open; the prisoner said he came to look for his brother: he was standing with his back towards me; I saw him in the glass; he was doing nothing: he ran down stairs; and I called stop thief: the bundle was tied up, but whether he had tied it up, I do not know: there is five worsted and cotton curtains, a pair of Manchester curtains, and some vallences; they were all in the drawers, except the Manchester curtains, which were in a chair, loose.
I am son to the last witness: Mrs. Hand called me to bring up a hair broom; as I was going up I heard her cry stop thief, and I stopped the prisoner at the bottom of the stairs, and kept him till the constable came.
I am constable: I took the prisoner and the things, which I have had in my possession ever since.
I went up to look for my brother, who worked for Mr. Jones; and the prosecutor came up and cried stop thief, and they took me.
