My father keeps the British coffee-house, in Cockspur-street : On Thursday, the 14th of June, I was sent for by Mr. Dean, a watch-maker, in Oxford-street; I went there, and saw a spoon that we had lost; I waited there till the prisoner came; I saw the prisoner receive the spoon from Mr. Dean; I gave him in charge to a constable, and he was taken to the watch-house; Mr. Dean is not here, the constable has got the spoon, it has got marked upon it, \"the British Coffee-house.\"	"s
You know nothing about the spoon, except what Mr. Dean said?
No.
Why is not Mr. Dean here?
He is very ill.
You have lost a great many spoons?
No, we have not.
You have a great many servants?
Yes.
And the prisoner was not a servant of your's, but a stranger?
Yes.
Who gave the spoon originally to Mr. Dean you do not know?
No.
Are you in partnership with your father?
No.
Nor your brother?
My brother derives a share of the business, but he is not in partnership.
They live in the house together, and live on the profits of the business?
Yes; we all live on the profits of the business.
Your brother has a regular share in the profits of the house?
Yes.
Therefore your brother is answerable for the losses of the house, in proportion to the share he derives from the profits?
No, he is not; he has only a certain salary out of the profits of the house.
I am a constable: On the 14th of June, as I past Mr. Dean's shop, he called me in, that was the way we got to the knowledge of the spoon; I let Mr. Morley know where it was, and his son went up to Mr. Dean's to see the spoon; I went with him, in the evening, to Mr. Dean's, and he returned the spoon to the prisoner; then Mr. Morley gave charge. Mr. Dean said, in the hearing of the prisoner, that he had offered him that spoon for sale, and he refused buying it. I then took him to Marybone watch-house; as we were going to the watch-house, he said, the spoon was not his, he had it to sell for his fellow servant.
The spoon was returned, in your presence, to the prisoner?
Yes.
What time of the day was this?
About a quarter past eight in evening.
Do you know, of your own knowledge, whether he was not to have called in half an hour, and been paid for them?
I do not.
Do you know a man of the name of Richard Worrall ?
No.
But there was a fellow servant of the prisoner that had had access to your house?
Yes.
The prisoner had no access to your house?
Yes.
In what capacity was he at your house?
He used to fetch away the hog's wash in the morning.
And therefore had an opportunity of robbing you, if he had so chose?
Yes.
Have you ever sold any table spoons?
No.
I believe there was another man, a fellow servant of the prisoner taken up?
Yes, and was taken before a Magistrate.
So that the man who had access to your house, escaped before the Magistrate, by throwing it upon the prisoner?
Yes.
How came Worrall to be discharged?
Because the spoon was not found upon him.
I got it from my fellow servant.
I am a fellow servant of the prisoner.
Do you remember at any time giving a spoon to the prisoner?
No further than one day when we brought the wash home, we found a spoon at the bottom of the tub.
You had been at the Coffee-house, and got a load of wash?
Not to that house in particular, I had been to two or three other houses; we found the spoon at the bottom of the wash, but did not know where it belonged to; my partner said, he had been to the house two or three times and they never gave him a pint of beer, and if he found any thing he would keep it.
