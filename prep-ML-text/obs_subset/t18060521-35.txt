I am groom to Mr. Baring; his stables are in George yard, Piccadilly .
Did you lose a bridle of your master's.
Yes, on the 2d of May; I saw it in the stable about nine o'clock on Friday morning; I did not miss it till Saturday about the middle of the day.
Now look at the prisoner at the bar, do you know him.
I saw him on Friday afternoon in a stable close to mine.
I am a pawnbroker. On Saturday the 3d of May the prisoner offered this bridle to pledge, he said it was his own property, it was given him by sir James Perryman, with whom he lived lately; I told him I believed it was very unusual for gentlemen to give their bridles away, particularly when it was such a good one; he said he had no further use for it, as lord Foley had bought his horses; I suspected the story, and had him taken into custody.
I am an officer of Hatton Garden; I took the prisoner in custody with the bridle; I saw the sadler's name on the bridle, I went to North Audley-street, and the moment they saw the bridle they told me who it belonged to.
On the 2nd of May as I came along the street I picked it up.
