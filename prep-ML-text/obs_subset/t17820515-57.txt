I am warehouseman to Messrs. Palling, Mather, and Palling. We had two porters, who lodged and boarded in the house. On the 1st of this month, James Connor , one of the porters, called me a quarter before six o'clock; I gave him the keys, to open the warehouse; I came down in about five minutes after, and saw the prisoner going out of the back door with a bag of pepper; I instantly went to the door, and called to her, but she would neither look back, nor speak; I went and laid hold of her; then she said, James gave it me.
Who was James?
One of the porters; the man I gave the keys to, to open the warehouse. After I had stopped her, I told her, You know James has no right to give you any thing out of the warehouse; and desired her to bring it in. She put it down under the sky-light; I looked at it, and saw it was black pepper. I bid James go and call Mr. Palling, and desire him to come down directly; he went on the stairs, but never called him. As I thought I must be on my oath about the pepper, I took it to the scales, to weigh it; James Connor came to me, under a pretence of seeing the weight of the pepper, and the prisoner ran out into the lane; I went after her, and took her again. By that time, Mr. Palling was come down, and I left the prisoner in the care of the footman, while I went to seek for a constable. There were 60 lb. weight of the pepper. We sent her to the Poultry Compter. When Mr. Mather came home, we sent for another constable, and took the porters up, and sent them there also; but, not having any positive fact against them, the Lord Mayor discharged them.
I only appear here as prosecutor; I was not at home when the robbery was committed.
I leave my defence to my counsel.
