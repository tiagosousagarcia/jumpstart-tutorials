I am wife of Edward Harrold ; I live at No. 22, Lambeth-hill ; I was in the upper part of the house where the robbery was committed, about three in the afternoon; I had locked the door and taken the key in my pocket; I was speaking to a neighbour in the upper part of the house; she informed me of a woman going out of the house, with some things in her apron; I have only one room in the house; I was not in my own room, I was moving out; upon that information I came down stairs, and found my doors open, and part of my things gone; my door was not broke, but had been undone with a key.
What did you miss?
I went out, about 100 yards off, I saw a woman with some things in her apron; I caught hold of her and brought her back, and a man came up to my assistance with the alarm of the neighbours; there were in her apron, two pair of sheets, two cloaks, one tablecloth, one apron, two child's frocks, and one child's coat; that woman was the prisoner; I am sure of it; the man secured her, and took the apron with the things of her, and took her into the publick house, and examined her; the man has the things here.
On the 10th of March there was a cry of stop thief; I was directed up the Old Change, and this prosecutrix had got hold of the prisoner, charging her with taking her things; she ned found to me, and let some of them said in the dirt; so I drew her apron strings, and tied them all together; I took her to the publick house, and in her pocket I found a bunch of picklock keys, about a dozen, and a chissel.
What is your husband's name?
Edward Harrold .
You was in an upper room?
Yes, speaking to an opposite neighbour; I pursued the prisoner, in about ten minutes after, I saw her in the Old Change; she dropped some of the things and stooped to pick them up; I never lost sight of her from the time I saw her to the time I took her; I found the things in her apron.
