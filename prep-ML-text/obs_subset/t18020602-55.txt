I am a sailor ; I live at the Brown-bear, East-Smithfield : Last Tuesday night, a little after ten, I came home, and found my chest broke open, and my clothes gone; the landlord of the house had stopped the prisoner with them, and there was a pair of breeches gone out of my chest, belonging to John Peake.
I keep the Brown bear, East-Smithfield, Johnson lodges with me: On the 1st of June, the prisoner came and asked for lodgings, he had slept in my house two nights before; I told him he might; after a little while, he pretended to be in liquor, and asked me to let him lie down; I told him he might, he went up and staid about twenty minutes, and then came down again; I thought I saw something round his waist, he went out, and I called him back, he went backwards in the yard to the privy, and shut the door, I went after him, and found these things upon him.
There was a soldier lodged in the house, of the name of Mills, and he asked me if I would sell some things for him, I said, I would, he desired me to conceal them; he said, he owed the master of the house some money.
There was a soldier in the house, but he is gone away.
