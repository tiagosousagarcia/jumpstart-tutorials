I am the wife of William Thompson . The prisoner came to my room about three weeks ago, a little before three o'clock. She stood there about an hour; then went away. There was a linen gown in a box, in the room, which was shut, but not locked. I had seen it a little before the prisoner came in. I missed it in ten minutes after she was gone. I had been down stairs three or six minutes, and had left her alone in the room.
I found the gown at Mr. Trip's, a pawnbroker.
I am servant to Mr. Trip. This gown was pledged at Mr. Trip's, on the 15th of June, I don't know by whom; but the prisoner came afterwards with a duplicate, and asked for the gown she had pawned. I shewed it to her, and she desired a duplicate of it; which I gave her.
She lent me the gown to pawn, to raise some money.
Is that true?
It is not.
