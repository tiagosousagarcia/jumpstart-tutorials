I am an Irishman. I was a stranger in this place; I had just come from sea, and wanted a lodging. I was sick and sore; I belonged to the Minerva. I was paid off. The prisoner picked me up, and took me into her lodgings in Church-lane , and shewed me the bed. She went out directly.
Was you sober?
Yes. I was very sick and lame. She came into the room again in about a quarter of an hour; I had not been asleep. She went to the tester of the bed, where I had laid my clothes. She took down the clothes and the breeches, and as she was laying the breeches on a chair eight guineas fell out of them on the floor; it was in a brown paper, and there were about ten or fourteen shillings dropped on the ground; she stooped down and took the gold up, and an half crown, and made off. I was not able to follow her, as I was sick and in bed at the time. The people told me she was a lodger there; there was nobody else in the room at the time she took down my clothes. I had no money left to bear my expences home to my native country. I have never got any of the money again.
He was leaning over a post; I was coming out with small beer in my hand; he said can't you afford more than small beer? I said no, if you will give me strong do. So I went up stairs; there were two young women there. He followed me. He was in the room three hours, and he got himself in that time much in liquor. I know nothing of his money.
