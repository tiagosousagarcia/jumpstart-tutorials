I am Lady's maid in Sir Alexander Crawford 's family. The prisoner lived servant with Sir Alexander Crawford three months. Having missed several things, I got a warrant to search her box. I found a pair of stockings, and some other things not mentioned in the indictment. The stockings belong to Sir Alexander's eldest son, who is twenty-one years of age. The prisoner's sister had a handkerchief belonging to Lady Crawford. When she was taken up, she said that she had found the handkerchief; afterwards she said it was given her.
I am a constable. I found the handkerchief at the prisoner's sister's. The prisoner opened her box very readily, and said the stockings were a pair of cast-off stockings; that she thought they were worth nothing.
I had an handkerchief from my sister. I lent her one, to put a lettuce in; and she left this handkerchief. It was my sister's own handkerchief; it had been given her by her mother. I had before that time taken notice of that darn, a little distance from the oilet hole in the corner.
I had lost one of my lady's handkerchiefs; she sent me to the prisoner's sister's, to see if I could get it. It is marked I. C. 36 in the middle of the handkerchief, and an oilet hole in the corner; it is easy to see the I. C. has been picked out: my lady's six handkerchiefs are all marked so
My mother had the handkerchief of one 'Squire Gates, in the country, and she gave it me.
