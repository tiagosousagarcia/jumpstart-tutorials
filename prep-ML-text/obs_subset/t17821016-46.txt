I am a servant , I was coming from my place, No. 133, Upper Thames-street; and this box was lost out of the coach on the 5th of October; there were two or three boxes put in, and one was taken out; the box I lost was opened at the Mansion House.
I was coming over London Bridge , and I saw the prisoner put his hand into the coach, take out a box, and call to a man by the name of Will to come and take it, I said Will shall not take it, and the prosecutrix came and claimed it: the prisoner said, if he ever got clear he would do me for it.
I know nothing of it.
