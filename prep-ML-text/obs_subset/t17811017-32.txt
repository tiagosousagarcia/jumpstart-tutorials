On the 8th of October, I was in a phaeton, in Holborn: I turned up Leather-lane : just as I was entering into it, Mrs. Bascombe received a blow in her face. She screamed out. I stopped instantly, and missed an umbrella, out of the head of the chaise. I saw a man run: I pursued him, and called, Stop thief, but I lost him. About a quarter of an hour after that, I was in Holborn, in the phaeton: I saw a mob; I went to know what was the matter. I found the prisoner in the custody of a constable. I went up to the prisoner, to look at him. He turned about, and said, Sir, they say I have stole your umbrella. I was informed the umbrella was in a shop in Holborn. I went and saw it.
As I was coming down Holborn, on Monday night, the 8th of this month, at the end of Leather-lane, a man came running down Leather-lane, and crossed Holborn, to Middle-Row. The prosecutor called out, Stop thief. Upon that I followed him, and took him by the collar. He had an umbrella under his coat, under his arm. He said he had got nothing. I said, Yes, he had got it under his coat: he gave himself a fling round, and dropped it into the kennel. I took the umbrella to a shop. It was never out of my sight. I am sure it was the same the prisoner threw into the kennel.
On the 8th of October, I had been to see a relation in Brook-street; crossing the way, I picked up this umbrella. This man came up, and said, it was stole. Upon that I threw it down, and said, If it was stolen, I had nothing to do with it. I had found it.
