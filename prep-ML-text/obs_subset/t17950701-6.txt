I had an information that this woman had been tried for stealing of pots, which made me watch her. I keep a public house in Little Britain ; she came in on the 11th of June, and had a glass of gin, and set down, and in the course of half an hour conveyed that pot into her pocket, how I don't know.
Where did she sit down?
In the tap room; and the pot was standing on the table; while she was sitting I missed it, and as she went out I followed her, and about three doors off I tapped her over the shoulder, and told her I should be glad to speak to her, I thought she had got some of my property about her; and she went to take the pot out of her pocket, I laid hold of her hand and stopped her from taking it out of her pocket; I told her the constable should take it out. I sent for a constable, and he took it out of her pocket in my house, in my presence.(The pot produced.) This is the pot that was taken out of her pocket, it was marked directly afterwards; here is the mark on it now.
Is that the pot you took out of that woman's pocket?
Yes, it is; immediately I took it I made a mark on it; it has been in my custody ever since.
I was very much in liquor, and had half a quartern of gin, and I never see the pot till I see it at Guildhall.
Court to Prisoner. What is your husband?
A carpenter.
