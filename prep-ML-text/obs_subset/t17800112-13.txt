I am a coachman; I put a basket behind my coach into the basket in Chisswell-street, on the 8th of January, at eight o'clock in the morning; after I had driven the coach about a quarter of a mile, keeping my eye round me as I saw people I suspected, I saw a man at Shoreditch running from the coach behind a waggon, and saw another man on the other side with a basket under his arm; a man called out to me to know if that man had any right to the basket; I said no; the prisoner was stopped and brought up to the coach, and from thence he was carried before a magistrate, where that basket was opened, and all the things mentioned in the indictment taken out of it.
How do you know it to be Mr. Chressey's?
There is a direction upon the basket to Mr. Thomas Chressey ; I don't know it otherwise; I have not informed Mr. Chressey of it.
It was lying along side a broad wheeled waggon when I took it up; I was coming from my work when it happened; there was no other man with me.
