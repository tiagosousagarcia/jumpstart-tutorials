I am a gardiner , near the Three Tuns, Kingsland . On Wednesday, the 17th of October, I was robbed; I went out at six in the morning, and returned at nine to breakfast; I went out at half past nine again; I left nobody there; I fastened the house by driving a large nail in the shutter; it is a cottage; I locked the door, and staid till ten, when I was called home, and found the window broke open, the nail broke in two, which I have in my pocket, and the pots of mirtles broke; there were the marks of patten rings all over the floor; there is but one boarded floor: it was a wet day: I found nobody in it: my neighbours were with me: the window was very low: I looked in my box, and missed a man's hat and a shirt, and a velveret waistcoat; the key was in the lock of the box, which was unlocked; I saw the prisoner go by in the morning, between six and seven, with a brickmaker, to a publick-house; I took the prisoner in the road going to Ball's Pond Turnpike, about half a mile from my house, about four in the afternoon; I took two duplicates from her; I gave them to Mr. Harper: I found all the things at Mrs. Pepperall's, a pawnbroker at Hoxton; the value of the hat was two shillings or half-a-crown; the waistcoat was almost new, worth two shillings and sixpence; the shirt is worth one shilling: my wife is not here.
I am a pawnbroker at Hoxton town: (produces the things) the prisoner came with them to me on the 17th of October, between eleven and twelve, and pledged the things in the name of Martha Marshall : I knew her before: I gave her three duplicates; I should know them again; she said they were her husband's.
I produce the things which I had from the pawnbroker's; I shewed her the duplicates, but I have since mislaid or lost them; the pawnbroker's is about a mile from Mr. How's house.
A man asked me to pledge them, and gave me a shilling; he told me to put the duplicates into my pocket.
