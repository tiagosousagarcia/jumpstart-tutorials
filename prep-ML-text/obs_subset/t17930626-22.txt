I am the clerk of St. George's, Hanover-square: I produce the certificate of the marriage of John Moran and Elizabeth Elliott in June 1792.
You don't recollect the person of Moran?
I do not.
I know the prisoner at the bar.
Do you know Elizabeth Elliott ?
I do, I was present at their marriage.
How long ago is it that you have seen Elizabeth Elliott ?
Within three weeks or a month from this time.
How old was Elizabeth Elliott at this time?
I don't know.
How long had you known her?
Not above a month before she was married.
Was she of age at the time she was married or not?
I cannot say.
Did not you hear that she was under the age of twenty-one?
I cannot say any thing about her age.
I was married the 14th of last February to the prisoner at the bar, at Hodnet, in the country of Salop, I lived with him four months before I found out he was married.
Who carries on this prosecution?
My friends.
You have an uncle?
I have.
Is not he at the expence of this prosecution? you are a servant girl I believe?
He has carried it on hitherto, he has been at the whole expence.
This prosecution would not have been carried on, if your uncle had not instigated you to it?
Certainly, I would wish to do as the law permits me to do; I could not do it myself.
I apprehended the prisoner and took him to the sign of the Hole in the Wall, by Bloomsbury-square, in this county.
