I am a watch-case maker ; I have lost a vast quantity of turnings within these three months: the prisoner worked for me, with six other men; he was about some work which produced a large quantity of turnings. I sent to Hatton-garden for an officer, we went up to his apartments, where none of the other men that work in the shop can go, and in searching his box, we found, inside a pair of breeches, some silver turnings; and when he was taken to Hatton-garden he said he had never taken any before; he had lived with me about three years; knowing him to have bad parents, I took him in out of charity, he lived with me two years as an errand-boy, and in consequence of his good behaviour, I took him apprentice.
On the 6th of this month, when I went to work, I missed a quantity of turnings from my lathe, I told Mr. Gooch of it and he searched the prisoner's box.
I searched the prisoner's box; I found these turnings in a pair of breeches, wrapped up in a glove.
These are the sort of turnings that are produced in our work.
My box was always open; I don't know how they came there.
