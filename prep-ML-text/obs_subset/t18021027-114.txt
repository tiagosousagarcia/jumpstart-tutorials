I am a horse-keeper , at Uxbridge , and lost a coat out of the yard.
On Saturday, the 23d of October, about a quarter before nine, the prisoner brought me a coat, and offered to sell it, saying, he was much distressed; I bought it, and soon after met Serratt looking after the man who stole it; I said I had bought it, and the man was just gone out of my shop.
I bought the coat the same morning for 1s. 6d. and finding it was not good enough to wear, I sold it for 2s.
