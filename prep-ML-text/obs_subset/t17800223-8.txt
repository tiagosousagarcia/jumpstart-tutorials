On the 30th of January my wife and I went out in the evening and left the prisoner, who was our servant , at home; when we returned she was gone.
What time did you return?
I believe a little after eight o'clock. My little girl informed me that a person had called on the prisoner, and that they both went out together. I missed the things mentioned in the indictment (repeating them.)
Had you seen them before you went out?
I do not recollect that I had seen them for several days, perhaps weeks before.
Have you found any of them again?
Yes, in Grub-street; I went the same night to the girl's mother to acquaint her that the prisoner was gone away, and asked if she knew where I could find her; she said she did not know of but one place where it was likely to find her, that was in Grub-street. I went there and found her and the things; the things were tied up in a sheet. I said they were mine. There was an old woman and her daughter in the house with her; I took them and the prisoner to the watch-house.
I am a constable. Mr. Arnold sent for me to Grub-street; he claimed these things (producing them) as his property; I took the prisoner, and the woman and her daughter before the Alderman; there the prisoner confessed she took the things.
Was any promise made to her to induce her to confess?
None at all that I heard.
Was there any threat made use of to her before you went or when you were before the alderman?
No, not a word that I know of.
I confessed more out of fear before the alderman than the truth.
She always behaved exceeding well; I respected her as a servant. I think she said when she was before the alderman, that the young woman took part of the things away, and she took part of them.
Was any thing said before you went before the alderman to frighten her?
Not by me.
Did you hear any body else say any thing?
No.
My husband and I went out and left the prisoner in care of the house. I saw some of the things that away, she would come in the evening and help me.
