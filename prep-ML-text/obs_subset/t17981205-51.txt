I am clerk to Mr. Bolt, wharfinger, at Dice-quay: On Saturday last, I was standing on Smart's-quay, which belongs to the same proprietor; I saw the prisoner take some block tin and put it under his coat; I saw a young man, of the name of Palsrey, run after him; I immediately pursued him and stopped him with the tin upon him; Palsery laid hold of him, and he immdeiately dropped the tin from behind him.
Whose property was it?
Mr. Bolt's; it was upon his wharf.
I watch upon the Quays: I saw the prisoner take up this block-tin and put it behind his coat, he carried it part of the way up the gateway, off the Quays; I pursued and took hold of him by the waistcoat, and said, my friend, where are you going to carry that to; he directly turned round and dropped the tin; he said, d-n your eyes, what is it to you; and then struck me, and knocked me up against the wall; then we took him till we got a City constable, and gave charge of him.
This is Mr. Bolt's property; it is worth ten-pence a pound.
I had been shipping rums off all day, and was a little tipsey; I saw a man on the wharf that asked me to carry it for him, and I had not carried it the length of this place, before this man stopped me; he pulled out his sword, and cut me over the temple; one of the men that helped to take me was the man that desired me to carry it for him, and he would pay me, but they have not brought him here.
