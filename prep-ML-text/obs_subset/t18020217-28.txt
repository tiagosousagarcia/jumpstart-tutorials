How old are you?
Fourteen: My mother lives in the Strand, she takes in washing : On the 6th of February, about seven o'clock in the evening, I was carrying home a bundle of linen to a lady of the name of Seymour; and, as I was going through Swallow-street , a man snatched the bundle from me.
Do you see him in Court?
Yes, that is him, (pointing to the prisoner) I had it on my left arm, he snatched it from me, and ran away.
Did you see him before he snatched it?
No; I had him in sight all the time till he was brought back; I did not see the bundle again till a quarter of an hour after he was taken.
On the 6th of February, I was in Conduit-street; the girl passed me and ran very fast; I saw a man run down the middle of the street, he was stopped by Mr. Lees; I did not see any thing about him, I saw the bundle found about twenty or thirty yards from Swallow-street, it was given to the girl; I went with her to Marlborough-street, where the bundle was delivered to the officer.
On Saturday the 6th of this month, I stopped the prisoner in Conduit-street; he was among the foremost of several people who were running towards me; I did not see the bundle till afterwards; I saw it picked up.
I took charge of the prisoner at the office.
I received the bundle from the girl, at the office. (Produces it.)
I am the mother of the first witness; I know these to be the same things that I sent by my daughter.
I know this to be the same bundle.
Did you take particular notice of the man who snatched the bundle from you?
I observed nothing but his coat; I kept my eyes upon him from that time till he was stopped; I never lost sight of him.
What sort of a night was it?
It was not very light.
The charge that is laid against me is false.
