I am wife of William Matthews ; the articles mentioned in the indictment were hanging on the line, in the lower room, in the parlour, in the room we live in, in Brook-street , facing School-house Lane; between eight and nine in the morning I saw them there; on Friday morning the 28th of September, I saw them again brought to my door by Henry Bridges , very soon after; I saw him coming out of the premisses, and asked the prisoner what he wanted, he made no answer; I am sure it was the prisoner, I saw him coming out of the door.
I am a journeyman baker; I was in my own house and heard Mrs. Matthews say, some person had been in her house; I ran after the prisoner, and took him not far from the house, and he took the bundle from his left side and threw it over his right, down School House Lane; I had not lost sight of the bundle or prisoner. (The bundle produced). Here is a cotton frock, a linen apron, a cotton pinnafore, and a linen shirt.
I would wish to ask where I was taken?
He was taken at the bottom of School House Lane.
I was taken by a butcher.
A butcher coming along threw a wet cloth over his face while I took him.
I was coming up from Black-wall, when I was stopped by a butcher; presently after this man came out of School House Lane, who was passing by me, and the butcher called to him and said, this is the man, and he took me, and afterwards a man came and brought this property, and said I stole it.
