I keep a public-house in Chandler-street, Grosvenor-square ; I went out for some pots; when I returued I heard there were some pots stolen.
I work with my father, who is a gun-maker; I was chopping some wood in the back yard, and saw the prisoner put three pots under her apron; I told Mr. Barker's maid of it, and she took them from her.
I leave myself to the mercy of the Court.
