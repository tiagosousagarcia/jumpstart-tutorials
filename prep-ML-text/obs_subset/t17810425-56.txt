I am a jeweller in East Smithfield . My shop shew-glass was robbed on the 31st of March, about half after eight in the evening. I was at the next door; I heard the cry of Stop thief! I saw the mob picking up some of the goods the thief had dropped; I saw the prisoner in custody.
I live opposite the prosecutor. I heard the glass break, and saw the prisoner take the things out of the shew-glass, and run away; I called out Stop thief!
I heard the cry of Stop thief! a person seized the prisoner, and delivered him to my care: all the things mentioned in the indictment were taken out of his pocket.
I heard the cry of Stop thief! I ran after the person; I fell down; this man came and picked me up, and said I was one of his companions: the gentleman took these things out of the fire place, and said I had them in my pocket.
