I am a bookseller ; I live at No. 143, High Holborn , I lost the books from a shew-board on Tuesday the 25th of June, between five and six; they were entitled Peregrine Pickle. I saw them at the Justice's about a fortnight afterwards.
On the 26th of June, between five and six, I saw the prisoner go by my door with some books in his hand, which he was putting under his coat; I supposed he had stolen them, and cried out stop thief! he ran and dropped the books; I picked them up; they are duodecimos, called Peregrine Pickle.
My Lord, I found the books in the street, two or three yards from the door, scattered about.
