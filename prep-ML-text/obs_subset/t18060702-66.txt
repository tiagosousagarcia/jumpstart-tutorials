I live in the Minories, I am a haberdasher. On the 26th of May last, about nine o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came to my shop and asked me for half a dozen of buttons, she looked at them and said they were good ones, she would have a dozen of them; she tendered me a shilling, I told her I knew it was a bad one, I asked her how many more of these shillings she had, she said she did not know what I meant; that moment I heard something fall, I went round and picked up a paper with a bad shilling and sixpence in it.
I am a constable; on the 26th of May I took the prisoner in custody, I searched her and found ninepence three farthings upon her; Mr. Dimes gave me this plain shilling, and one shilling and sixpence.
(to Dimes) What did the buttons cost.
Sixpence.
Will you have the goodness sir to look at that money.
This is a counterfeit one, it is newly coloured and has the grease upon it to make it look as if it had been in circulation, the other shilling is also bad, and the sixpence is bad, they are of the same kind.
I did not drop the shilling and sixpence in the shop, but I offered him the shilling.
