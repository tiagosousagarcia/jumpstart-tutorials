I am a cheesemonger in Bearbinder-lane : On the 11th of December, I was coming home, I met the prisoner at the bar with a cheese under his arm; I stopped him; he threw down the cheese, and ran away; I pursued him and took him, I never lost sight of him; I know the cheese to be mine by the mark, I think it is 9l.
I am the wife of Joshua Bewley: On Wednesday, the 11th of December, about six o'clock in the evening, I was drinking tea in the accompting-house, I saw a man take up a Cheshire-cheese, and run out with it, it was upon the floor inside the shop; I immediately holloaed out, stop thief, and went out at the door; I saw the cheese lay at the corner of the court; the cheese was of the same size, there were one hundred and fifty of them at the door, and it appeared to me to be one of the same.
The court is nearly opposite to me; I had seen the cheese there not five minutes before, when I went out.
I heard the cry of stop thief; there were several people running, I ran, and Mr. Bewley laid hold of me, and accused me with stealing his cheese.
