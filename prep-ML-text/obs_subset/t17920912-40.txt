I am a whitesmith : on Saturday the 7th of July, in the evening about eight o'clock, I lost my watch; the maker's name is Wontner. The prisoner was my servant .
I am servant to a pawnbroker: I produce a watch; I took it in of the prisoner, on the 7th of July; I gave him a duplicate; he pledged it in the name of Samuel Johnson , for 12 s. It was in the evening, about half past eight o'clock.
The prisoner told me if I would excuse him he would work it out; I told him no, justice must take place.
