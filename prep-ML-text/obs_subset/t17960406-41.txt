I live in Northumberland-street : On the 6th of March, I returned home in the evening, about eleven, and I was told that the prisoner, who was my servant , was gone to bed, which led me to some suspicion; and I enquired if the plate was where it ought to be; Mrs. Parker immediately went down where the plate ought to have been, and I discovered that there were twenty spoons missing; some table spoons, some gravy spoons, and some tea spoons; I went up stairs to where he was in bed, and asked him where the plate was; and he told me, after some enquiry, that it was pawned; I desired the watchman to be called, and he to dress himself; and I sent him to the watch-house; he said, that his sister had pawned it.
Did you make use of any threats or promises?
No; I did not.
Was his examination taken in writing?
I cannot say; I went to the house in which, he said, his sister lived; and it was then past twelve o'clock; the house was knocked up, and I saw the sister; she produced some duplicates.
How long had the prisoner been with you?
Very near a twelvemonth.
How lately before this had you looked over the plate?
I never looked over it myself.
You cannot pretend to say but these various articles were taken at different times?
They might; it happened that we had had no company for three weeks; and if we had not the four spoons at the corners of the table, I made no enquiry about it.
I believe a spoon is the largest article you have lost?
Yes.
And that is not worth 40s.?
No.
I am a pawnbroker; I took in several articles of plate, and a coat, (producing them,) f one Sarah Nicholls .
These articles are of the description of what I lost.(The prisoner did not make any defence).
