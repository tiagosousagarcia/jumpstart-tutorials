I am a journeyman coach-maker , in King-street, Westminster . I lost a surtout coat out of the house, last Tuesday. I had it on about nine o'clock in the morning. I took it off, and put it in a back room, and went out. I returned in the afternoon about six o'clock. I saw it the same night at the rotation-office in Litchfield-street.
Thomas Cherry is my son; he lodges with me. On Tuesday when he went out in the morning he left his coat on a chair in the back room. The prisoner came into the house and pretended she wanted to make water. I took her to the back room. I was in the shop while she was in the room; when she was gone I missed the great coat. I made enquiry after it and found it at a pawnbroker's.
I am a pawnbroker. I took in the coat in pawn of the prisoner on the 9th of January. In about half an hour after that the prosecutor's mother came and said the coat was stolen from her.
I was going along; I met a young woman. She asked me to pawn this coat for her. She said she would give me sixpence, and treat me with a pot of purl.
