I am a drayman to Messrs. Bell and Combrune, in Golden-lane . I was ordered to go with three butts of beer; after I had done, we laid our tackle down, as we usually do; we then put them on the dray, while we went in to have a bit of victuals, and when we came out the rope was gone.
I am a headborough. I went to the prisoner's room, on the 8th of February, in the morning; he was in bed; it was about eight o'clock, on Monday; I asked where he got this rope? he said, he found it, he picked it up in the street: on the next day I found the hoop at an old iron shop, in Turnmill street, hanging for sale.
I keep an iron shop in Turnmill-street; and this iron hoop was brought for sale, but I cannot say by whom.
I am a headborough. On the 8th of February, I went to Hyson's room, and it was padlocked; we broke it open, and brought this rope from out of his room.
Can you swear it to be the rope of your master's?
I cannot; I can swear to the hoop.
