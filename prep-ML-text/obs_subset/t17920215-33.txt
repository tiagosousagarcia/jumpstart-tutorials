On the 9th of this month, I had been to the Old Hats, on the Uxbridge road; returning home, one of the mail-coaches overset us, and broke the chaise, so that we were obliged to walk; the officers of Bow-street lent us assistance; I sent next day for the chaise, and the knee-boot was lost, it had been cut off; the accident happened on Wednesday, and on the Friday they sent for me to Bow-street.
On Wednesday evening, the 8th of February, about eleven o'clock, I stopped the prisoner; he had this bundle tied up in a handkerchief; he said they were his clothes; I took him into the turnpike-house, and found it was a knee-boat; he said he found it; two of my partners presently came up, and said a stage was broke down on Shepherd's-bush common ; I went there the next day, and met the people; Mr. Wildman had sent for the chaise; we went to Islington on the following day, and ripped off the remainder of the leather knee-boot, and on comparing them they matched exactly.
All that my partner has said is true; I know no more.
I am very sure it is the same.
I had been in the country for my tools, and on my return I saw two men making off over a field; I saw the bundle lying in the road, and came up to this turnpike, and there they stopped me; I did not say it was my clothes, I said it was probably clothes.
