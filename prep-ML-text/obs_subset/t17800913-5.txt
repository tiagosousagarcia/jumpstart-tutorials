I am the wife of James Fisher . On the 22d of August I locked my door and went out about five o'clock; I returned home at seven in the evening. Then I missed the things mentioned in the indictment (repeating them) I never saw the prisoner till I saw her at Sir John Fielding 's.
I saw the prisoner go into the house where the prosecutor lodges, at about six o'clock. I was in my room, which is just opposite, in Great Wild-street . I saw her in Mrs. Fisher's room. I saw her take something white off a chair, and put it into her apron, then I saw her come out of the house. I did not see her take the things out of the drawers, but I saw her go to the part of the room where the drawers were. She was in the room for about ten minutes.
Before she came out I called up Mr. Burford, my landlord's brother, to see her stripping the room. When I saw her come out, I shewed her to Mr. Burford. He went after her and secured her.
I came down stairs. Mrs. Wright shewed me the prisoner; she was in the street; she said that was the woman who had robbed the lodging. I stopped her, and found these things in her apron. I took her to the house where Mrs. Fisher lodges and sent for a constable.
I live in this house; when the prisoner was taken I saw her drop these false keys from under her petticoats (producing them) One of them opened the room door very easy.
I went to this house to buy some tea; the woman was not at home; a woman came down stairs and asked me if I would pawn these things for her at Mr. Richardson's, and she would give me a shilling for my trouble. I took the things to carry to pawn. She said she would come after me. This gentleman stopped me. I never was in the room, nor near it.
