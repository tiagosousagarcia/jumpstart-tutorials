On the 16th of October, between eleven and twelve, I was in the parlour, I observed a man going out at the shop-door, I went out and saw the prisoner walking towards the Adelphi, and I thought his arms were in a position as if he had something carrying before him; I immediately went after him, and when he came to the corner of the Adelphi he ran across to Bullen-court, he was then putting them into his pocket; I asked him what he had got there; he said, some paper; I opened the paper, and found sixteen pair of boys beaver gloves in it, which I myself had taken down about twenty minutes before to serve a customer with, (produces them) ; I have had them ever since, they have my marks upon them.
It is the first time I ever did such a thing in my life, and beg the favour to go to sea.
