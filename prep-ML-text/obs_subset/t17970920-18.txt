- On the 28th of July last, the prisoner was in the tap-room; I went down to draw a pot of beer, when I came up I missed two papers of halfpence; the prisoner said, he was very willing to be searched, and I said, I would not search any body, I would send for a constable, and have every body searched; and he told me he would tell me where they were, if I would let him go; I told him I would not let him go; before the Magistrate, he said where they were; we found the halfpence in a crevice in the necessary, very high up.
- I found these halfpence in a crevice in the necessary, the prisoner told me where they were; I asked him why he did not tell what he had done with the halfpence; he said, if I searched that crevice in the necessary, I should find them.
Were they in that paper when you lost them?
Yes; and when I asked him what he was doing at the bar, my brother had told me that he saw him reach over the bar, and he said he had reached over for a case-knife, to cut his nails.
I only reached over for a case-knife; I know nothing at all about the halfpence.
