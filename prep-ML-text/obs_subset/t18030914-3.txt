- I live in Crown-court, Cheapside , I am a silk manufacturer : On Monday the 18th of July, the prisoner was stopped by a pawnbroker, he was a clerk in our accompting-house .
I am a pawnbroker, at London Wall; on the 18th of July, in the evening, the prisoner offered me twelve silk handkerchiefs to pledge, and from his manner, I suspected they were improperly come by; I asked him where he lived, he told me, in St. Mary-axe; I told him, I should send and see whether he did or not, upon that he ran away out of the shop, I followed him and he was taken; I took him to the Compter, and learnt that he lived with Mr. Clay.(Produces the handkerchiefs.)( Thomas Gabell proved the handkerchiefs to be the property of William Clay and Richard Smith.)
I throw myself on the mercy of the Court.
