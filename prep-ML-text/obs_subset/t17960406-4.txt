I am a smith and ironmonger , in Wapping : On the 24th of February, I was told the prisoner had robbed me; I sent for an officer, and as he went out of the shop he was taken and searched; I found his pockets filled, all of them, with nails, the weight of which was twelve pounds, the officer has them.
I am a constable; I took these nails (producing them,) out of the prisoner's coat pockets.
They were taken out of his pockets loose; I cannot swear to them, except that others nails of the same mould, that I have in the shop, correspond with these.
Can you tell whether there was such a quantity missing?
I cannot.
