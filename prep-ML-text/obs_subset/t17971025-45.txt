I am an upholsterer in St. Paul's Church-yard ; the prisoner was a weekly porter with me; I employed him to remove some old lead from the top of the warehouses, that were under repair; I missed the lead, and afterwards saw it in the cellar, I desired my clerk to mark it, and keep watch; I saw the prisoner go in at the door, I collared him and found it upon him. I sent for a constable, and he has got it; I told him I was astonished at his doing so, for he was a very good servant. It was a cistern-head of a gutter.
What character has he borne?
A very good one up to this time.
I marked some lead, at the request of Mr. Oakley, which was afterwards found upon the prisoner.
I was in liquor, and did not know what I was doing.
