On Wednesday last, the 16th of October, about eight in the morning, I saw the prisoner at the bar coming out of a warehouse at Botolph-lane , which belongs to the company of wharfingers , Buggin and Co. I observed his breeches stuck out behind, I susspected he had something he should not have, and I followed him up to the gate that leads to the street; in Thames-street I stopped him, he said he had been up at work, and he said they had given him three half-pence for what he had done; I said, what for filling your breeches with sugar, and I brought him back to the counting-house, and I found a bag of sugar concealed in his breeches, weight eleven pounds; the sugar is my property, as it is under my charge and the rest of my partners.
This sugar I found in the passage under the gateway, behind the gateway; as I went into the street, he did not stop me till after I had found it.
