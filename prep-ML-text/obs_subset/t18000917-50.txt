I am a gangsman at Cox's Quay; I have eight partners, (names them); I saw the prisoner take a quantity of leaf tobacco out of a hogshead from the gateway in Cox's Quay , and put it into the waistband of his breeches; I stopped him, and took him into custody.
I am an officer belonging to the Customs: I took the tobacco from the prisoner; it was part concealed in the waistband of his breeches, and the remainder part in the crown of his hat. (Produces it).
I picked it up under the gateway; there is short straw and filth among it.
(To Phillips.) Are you sure you saw him take it out of the cask?
He took it out with his left-hand. GUILTY . (Aged 26.)
