I live in Whitechapel . I keep a shoe warehouse . On the 26th of April, about nine o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came into my shop, he asked for a pair of shoes; I opened the glass case, he had his hand in the case immediately, and took out this pair of shoes; but I was not certain whether he had not put them in again. I said here is a pair of shoes, will these suit you; I told him they were seven shillings and six-pence, he said will you take five shillings and six-pence, and drawed towards the door; I had a suspicion he had the shoes, but I was not certain; I said let us see your money. He took these shoes out of somewhere about him, but from where I cannot tell; he said these are a better pair of shoes than them; I said them are my shoes, he said he knew they were my shoes, he did not want to rob me of them. I called for the patrol and secured him.
On the 26th of April, in the evening I went into that gentleman's shop, and enquired for a pair of shoes, he shewed me a pair of round toed shoes, I told him they were no good to me, I was a seaman, I could not get them in between the ratlings; he asked me seven shillings and six-pence, I said I could buy a pair of slop shoes for five shillings and sixpence; but I would rather have a pair of his making; that pair of shoes laid on the prosecutor's desk; I said these are a better pair than those you asked me seven shillings and six-pence for; he said they are my shoes, I said I know they are; he then said if I let you have them for five and six-pence, you will treat me with a drop of gin, if you will not treat me, I will not let you have the shoes; he sent for an officer. I had none of his property about me. I never robbed a man of a penny in my life. I never offered to go out of the house.
