I am an assistant elder in the East-India Company's warehouses at Horslydown ; the prisoner was employed as a labourer : On Friday, the 16th of December, about two o'clock, I informed the prisoner I suspected he had some of the Company's property about him; I told him I must insist upon his stripping, and searching him particularly; he saved me that trouble, by confessing that he had them; he said, it is true I have, and gave me some galls out of his waistcoat, I suppose about three pounds, they were in a small canvas bag; I took him to the accompting-house, in Billiter-lane; Rigge, a constable, was sent for, who searched him again; another bag of galls, very similar to the one I had taken from him, was found; I saw it about a minute after it was found, they were of the same quality with those in the warehouses.
I am a constable of Aldgate ward: I was sent for to Billiter-lane on the 16th of December last, about half past two o'clock, to take charge of the prisoner at the bar; I went, and searched him; I found in the after-part of his small clothes this bag of galls, weighing three pounds six ounces, (produces it.) I then went to the prisoner's lodgings in a lane in Horslydown-court, where I found pepper, indigo, borax, loose galls, and a number of other things.
(To Mr. Matthews.) Those are the sort of articles that would be in the India Company's warehouses?
We have articles of that description; these are blue galls, and correspond exactly with the galls in the warehouse; he was at work close by this heap of galls; I took him to be a very honest man till this time.
