What are you?
An ironmonger .
Where do you live?
At Messrs. Downer and Sandys, in Fleet-street: On the 27th of August, Saturday afternoon, about five o'clock, I was going from our house towards the Strand ; I saw a mob collected near Mr. Birkett's, the chymist; I ran up to see what was the master, and found a man in fits; I remained there a few minutes only, during which time an alarm was given,\"your pocket is picked,\" or, \"there is a pickpocket,\" I cannot say which; I turned round immediately, put my hand to my pocket, and found I had lost a pocket handkerchief, which lay about two yards behind me; Mr. March collared the prisoner, and secured him immediately, with my assistance.
I suppose there was a press upon you?
Yes, there was a crowd upon me.
I am a fishing-tackle maker: I was going up Fleet-street about five o'clock, and saw the prisoner at the bar take a yellow handkerchief out of Mr. Owen's pocket; I called to Mr. Owen, laid hold of the prisoner, and he dropped the handkerchief.
- I was sent for, and took charge of the prisoner. (Produces the handkerchief.)
There is no mark upon the handkerchief; I cannot say that it is mine.
The handkerchief that the prisoner threw down, who picked it up?
Mr. Owen.
