I am the wife of the prosecutor. In June last, I let a room in our house, in Little St. Andrew's-street, Seven Dials , to the prisoner, by the week, and with it the goods mentioned in the indictment. I went up into the prisoner's room, and missed all the goods I had let to her with the room. She said they were at an acquaintance's in Long-acre. I told her if she would let me know where they were I would contribute something towards getting them out of pawn; she refused to inform me. I sent for a constable and gave him charge of her.
The prisoner pledged these things with me.
My husband went away and left me with two small children. I was greatly distressed; I meant to get them out of pawn on Tuesday and restore them, but they took me up on the Monday.
