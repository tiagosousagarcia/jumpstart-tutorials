- I keep a house, No. 25, Angel-court, Princes-street, Westminster : I let the prisoner a lodging, furnished, on Monday the 5th of September, at four shillings and sixpence a week, she slept one night in the house; on Wednesday I went and knocked hard at the door, no person answered, I opened a closet next the door, and saw the key, and opened the door; when I missed the things, I went round to the pawnbrokers, where I found them. I found her at Mr. Murdock's the next Sunday; a great many duplicates were taken from her.
I keep a broker's shop; On the 8th and 9th, the prisoner sold me a bolster, a quilt, and a pair of sheets; I gave seven shillings for the bolster, six shillings and sixpence for the quilt, and six shillings and sixpence for the sheets; she said they were her own.
I am an officer: I took the prisoner into custody; she shewed me the shop where she sold the things.
I took them from distress, and leave myself to the mercy of the Court.
