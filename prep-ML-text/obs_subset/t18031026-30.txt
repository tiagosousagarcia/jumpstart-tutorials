I am a surveyor and builder, in Berkeley-square: On Friday evening, the 21st of this month, a person of the name of Ellis gave me some information.
I am a constable: On the 21st of October, between seven and eight o'clock in the evening, I was at the bottom of Essex-street, Strand, under the arch-way, I saw the prisoner come out of the house of Mr. Plowden, he had a parcel wrapped up in a dirty sheet of white paper; I had a suspicion, and followed him to an old iron shop in Shire-lane, he was there about two or three minutes before I followed him in; when I went in, I saw the lead in the scale, which is here to be produced; I asked him what he had got there, he first said, it was his own property, and at the watch-house, he said, it was the property of General Bulkeley ; I searched him, and found in his pocket a key that opened Mr. Plowden's door; I then went to General Bulkeley 's, and from thence to Mr. Harrison's, whom I found to be the prisoner's master; the lead does not match to any thing; the prisoner slept in the house, it was repairing, and the key was the proper key of the house.
Mr. Plowden's house belongs to General Bulkeley, his name is Felix, he is the landlord of it; I don't know that the lead belongs to General Bulkeley; the prisoner has worked for me four or five years, I always found him very honest.
I am foreman to Mr. Harrison; I know there was lead on the premises, but I know nothing of this lead, I did not miss any.
I picked up the lead in coming up the street.
