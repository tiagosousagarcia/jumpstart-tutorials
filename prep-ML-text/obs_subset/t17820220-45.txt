I went there with a young woman, I slept there, but not with the prisoner; she never quitted the room till day-light, when she went but with an intent, as she said, to fetch purl in half an hour I missed my buckles; the prisoner was found at ten at night in liquor; my buckles were left in my shoes and knees of my breeches, on the bed side, the other girl did not go out of the room, after I went to bed, I found her at ten o'clock, on Thursday night, the 14th, at the Magpye, on Saffron-hill, much in liquor; I found the buckles the next morning at Mr. Pearson's, the corner of Stonecutter's-street, a pawnbroker.
