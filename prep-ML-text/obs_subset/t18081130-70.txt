I am a victualler ; I live in Tash street, Gray's inn lane ; I saw nothing of the transaction.
I am servant to Mr. Exton; the prisoner came in and ordered a pot of beer, and change for half a crown; my mistress gave me a pot of beer, two shillings and a penny piece; the prisoner did not give me the half crown; she took the pot of beer from the and the change for half a crown, and told me to go back for a pipe of tobacco; when I came back with the pipe of tobacco she was gone.
I saw the woman come into my passage. No. 45, Tash street; I was there. She went out in the street; she came in again, I asked her what she wanted; she said she did not want any thing. I went to the door and watched her; she met this little girl in the street and took the pot of beer from her and some money; she put the beer down next door to me and went off down Gray's Inn lane.
That gentleman who has witnessed against me, and said I was the person before the magistrate, he said I had a long sleeve gown on, and that is a thing I was never in possession of in my life. In the next place, he told the magistrate that he saw the woman give me two shillings and a penny in my hand. When the magistrate asked him again if he was sure - he said, no, he saw some money; he said it was half after seven in the evening, then it was dark. It is very odd he should come and swear against me in such a manner. I would sooner go to a prison immediately than take a false oath.
