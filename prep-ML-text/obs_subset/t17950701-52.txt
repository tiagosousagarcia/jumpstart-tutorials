What relation are you to Joseph Shaw?
His wife; he lives in St. Martin's Le Grand . In about half an hour we missed three pots, and I suspected the prisoner, and I catched this one on her half way down the stairs where the pots stood; the pots were in the house on the stairs; I forced it from her; she would not come up at first, but I forced her.
I was drinking with my brother, and the smoaking tobacco overcame me, and I took the pot and went down the cellar to get a little water.
