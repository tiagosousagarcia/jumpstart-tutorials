I live at No. 5, in High-street, St. Giles's . On the 19th of January, I was robbed of four pair of horse scissars; I was in the cellar at work; I know nothing of the transaction.
I am sister to the prosecutor. On the 19th of January, I came to the door with a bunch of greens, about eleven o'clock. The prisoner was on the step of the door, coming out; and I made room for him to pass; I came in, and my brother came out of the cellar, and said, how came the glass open? I said I did not know; I told him; I went after him; I knew the colour of his coat; I overtook him, and collared him; I told him he had stole some scissars; he delivered them to me directly; he gave me no rough usage; he said he was sorry for what he had done; I told him I did not want to hurt him, if I had my property.
I lived with Lord Monson's family, and they are out of town; I have nobody here.
