I am an acting lientenant . On the 26th of September, about eleven o'clock in the day-time, passing through Fleet-street , I felt in my pocket and missed my pocket-book; I was stopped by means of a horse and cart standing in the way; when I missed my pocket-book I turned round and saw the prisoner the next person to me: Mr. Rhodes, who is a witness, said, that is the person who has picked your pocket; and I caught hold of him; it was not found upon him, it is in the possession of the beadle.
I observed the prisoner pick the pocket of that gentleman in Fleet-street, the corner of Silver-street; I did not know the prosecutor before; the prisoner had a pocket-book in his hand when he turned round to make off, upon observing me looking at him, he threw the pocket-book into the street, I immediately collared him, and he said he picked it up; but I was conscious of his guilt; I seized him and holloaed to a boy in the road, who picked it up.
I am an officer; I took charge of the prisoner and the pocket-book;
This is my pocket-book; I had a two-pound note in it, and some other papers, which are in it now.
Is your name written in that pocket-book?
No.
Perhaps you only know that it was a pocket-book like that you lost?
I have every reason to believe it is the same book; I had had it but a few hours in my possession, and therefore I am not so positive of it; but I have no doubt of its being the pocket-book.
