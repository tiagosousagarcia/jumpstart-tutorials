You I believe were ill.
Yes, I was ill of the dropsy, and I was attended by that woman at the bar as a nurse, about a year and a half ago; this was on the 19th of June 1805.
Do you know a person of the name of Sarah Mumford .
Yes; I had previous to my illness, deposited in her hands four pounds. I desired the prisoner to go to Mrs. Mumford for one pound only.
Had you said any thing to her that she had no more.
Yes, I said that I had four pound in her hand.
Did you ever get any money of her.
No, not a farthing; I never saw her till she was taken up this day week.
I am a widow woman, I live in St. Martin's street, Leicester Fields.
Do you know John Lisle .
Yes, I have known him for these forty years; he had placed four pounds in my hand. The prisoner on the 19th of June, came to me and asked me for four pound for Mr. Lisle. I said what does he want with four pound, she said that they had began to lay on the water in his house, and she supposed he wanted it to pay for it; I had no suspicion of any fraud. I gave her the money, a two pound note and two ones.
Did you ever see the woman again.
No.
How soon did you discover this fraud.
The same night; they sent to me to know whether she had been or no,
In the month of June 1805, did you see that woman.
She came there to the poor house, she said that she had a fortune left her, and that she had got this four pound to convey her in the country. She came in a coach, and she changed n one pound note to pay for the coach.
I had a drop too much on that day, I was very sorry the next morning that I had done it, and I thought I should have broke my heart.
