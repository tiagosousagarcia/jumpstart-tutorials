I am a coppersmith; the prisoner at the bar was servant to the house of Thoytes and Co. warehouse keepers and in the brush line ; he had the care of the warehouse, he lived there, there was some little offence or dispute, and he was turned away, he went away on Saturday, the 16th, and on Friday the 18th information was brought me of what he had done; I know nothing of my own knowledge; I appear here in behalf of Thoytes and Co. whose property it is.
I went to Mr. Thoytes and ordered thirty one pounds of copper tacks, this Cripps procured it for me; in the course of the day I had a bill delivered to me for the money, he first told me it was on his own account, and then afterwards he made out the bill in Thoytes and Co's. name; our clerk did not like to pay the bill, he then wrote out a fresh bill. Mr. Slater and Jackson, bought of George Cripps . The whole is that I bought some tacks of him, and he sold them on his own account, and I had two different bills.
I sold the goods to Thoytes and Co. I believe they are the goods in question, and he used to sell for Thoytes and Co.
