I was in my masters', Messrs. Anstie and Worstead's warehouse yesterday morning, between seven and eight o'clock. I turned my head round, and saw the prisoner walk out of the shop. I immediately went after her, and took her about three or four doors off, and found the loaf of sugar under her cloak. It is my master's property.
