I am a hackney coachman : I lost eight shillings on Monday, the 8th of October, between one and two in the morning; I was waiting at the Piazza Coffee House, and was asleep in my coach; I was quite sober; I had been sitting some time, and I felt something go out of my breeches pocket; I jumped up, and the prisoner got out of the coach; I never lost sight of him, and pursued him: I charged him with the watch; he was searched in the watch-house; nothing was found upon him; my breeches were cut.
When this man was searched there was only three pence found upon him?
I don't know.
Did not you offer to let him go about his business if he would give you eight shillings?
I asked him for my money again.
I am a watchman in Covent-garden; the prosecutor gave me charge of the prisoner, and I took him to the watch-house.
I leave it to my counsel.
