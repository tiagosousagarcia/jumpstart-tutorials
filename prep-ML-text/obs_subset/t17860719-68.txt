I am a widow; on Wednesday the 12th of June last, I lost seven yards of thread lace, about four or five in the afternoon; I had been robbed the week before; the same thieves that robbed me before, came to me again; I lost it in Rosemary-lane , at the front of Mr. Collins's house that I rent; the prisoner came up to my place where I sell my goods, which is out in the street, and he took the lace, I had hold of the end of this very lace, and he ran away with it; and he took five yards; he snatched it away from me; I ran after him; I was determined to die before I would let it go, and running after him with it, he put his hand in his bosom and drew it out; there was a multitude of people about us; I had seen the prisoner before, and had a notion that he had robbed me; there were two or three women came up with him; I saw his face while they prevented his going off; I had no lace but what was my own; he was committed.
Did you see me pick it off the stones?
No, I saw him open it.
Did not you say it was the woman in the brown gown that took it?
No, that was another man.
I had been into the fair, and bought this coat and hat, and I found the lace on the stones, the prosecutor came up to me and said it was hers, and I gave it to her, and she went to the stall and stood there a few minutes, and came back again and seized me by the wrist, and said it was taken by a woman, and I must know the woman, I had no man or woman with me.
