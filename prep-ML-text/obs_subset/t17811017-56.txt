There was a bale of stuff sent down to my wharf, which was stolen.
I packed up a truss of stuff that contained nineteen pieces, at Messrs. Story, Alder's, and Co. in Lawrence-lane. I marked it E. Coulson, Hull. It was to go to Mr. Coulson, at Hull. I carried it down to Dice-key , and delivered it there to the wharfinger, and gave him the sufferance and the wharfage.
I am wharfinger of Dice-key. About two or three o'clock, in the afternoon, there was a truss came down for the Hull ship trader, marked E. C. Hull, that is, For E. Coulson, Hull. I saw it put upon the wharf. About ten minutes after, I was informed, by the ship's company, that it had been cut open, and plundered. Two pieces were found behind an hogshead, close to some hops. I had those two pieces taken up, and carried, with the remainder, on board the ship.
I am a carman. I passed by the prisoner, when he stood upon the keys, with another man, and his back against this bale. I went on board Capt. Johnson's ship, who was going to Hull. When I came back, while I was tying the rails of my cart, I turned my head, and saw the prisoner, with one or two pieces of green stuff in his hand, within two or three yards of the bale. I jumped out of the cart, to secure him, and he made a run. I turned round, and saw two pieces more, that lay behind the hogshead. The prisoner got clear off, and I don't know when he was taken. I am sure he is the same man.
I have proof I was at home at the time this man says I was there; but they are not here now.
