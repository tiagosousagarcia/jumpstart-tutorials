I am a green-grocer and poulterer , No. 37, Greek-street, Soho : On the 29th of May, about a quarter before ten o'clock, I was standing in the shop, I saw the prisoner come up to the basket, I thought he wanted to buy some eggs; I went to the door, and saw the prisoner running down the street with the basket of eggs; it was a wicker basket containing one hundred and fifteen eggs; I never lost sight of him, I called to him not to throw them down, I was just behind him, and when I came up he immediately threw them down and broke most of them; I knocked him down, and then he threw me down upon the kirb, and hurt me very much.
I was passing by, and this man laid hold of me, and said I was one of the party; he knocked me down, and kicked me till I was not able to stir myself; I lost an entire new hat off my head. GUILTY .
