I am servant to Mr. Joseph in Goodman's-fields : It being a hard forst, the prisoner took up the pails which were in a yard, and asked me if he should fill them with water; I said, no, and bid him put them down, but he would not; at last, I told him to make haste, and bring it; he went away, and I never saw him till a fortnight after, when I met him, and asked him if he recollected me; he said, no; I asked him if he recollected the pails; he d - d my eyes, and said, no; I called for assistance, but he said, if I dared to call out, he would stick me with a knife, which he drew out of his pocket; then he said if I would go with him to a public-house, he would give me the pails; I went, and he bid me wait at the door, but I would not; he then run through the house, out at the back door; the landlady told me where he lived, and I had him taken up the same day.
I went to fill the pails, and going along I met a ship-mate, who said to me, you are loaded with cold water, will you have some hot purl; I went into a public-house with him, and left the pails at the door; when I came out again, they were gone.
