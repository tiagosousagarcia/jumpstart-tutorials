I am a washer-woman in Mitre-court, Limehouse ; I lost a shirt the 1st of this month off from the line; I hung it up to dry; it belonged to Richard Smith ; it was found in the prisoner's custody between seven and eight o'clock in the evening.
I am a silversmith and slop-seller. On Thursday evening, I believe three weeks to-morrow, the prisoner came to my shop, and asked me to lend some money on the shirt; I told her, I took in no pledges, but I bought outright; with that she asked me, if I would buy it? On this, she took the shirt from under her arm, and opening it, I found it was wringing wet. I told her, it was not her's; she said, her husband was a rigger of a ship, and if I did not like to buy it, to give it her again. I asked her, what she asked for it; she said, three shillings. I told her, I should have liked it better if she had asked three crowns. So I sent out to a neighbour, who is an officer, and we took her to the magistrate's, and I have kept the shirt ever since.
I never offered to pledge it; and because I would not take three shillings for it, she sent for a constable. And the way I came by the shirt, a young man met me, and asked me if I would go with him; and he had no money, but he said he would make me a present of that shirt.
