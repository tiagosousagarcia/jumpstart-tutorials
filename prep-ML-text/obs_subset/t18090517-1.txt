I am a boot maker , I live in Jermyn-street. On Sunday morning last, about three o'clock, I met the prisoner near Exeter-change, at a public house door; she asked of me a glass of peppermint to drink; we went into the public house and had a glass a-piece; she took me home to her lodging in Dyot-street .
Were you sober
Not quite sober; I remember every thing I did; we went to bed together. In a short time I fell asleep; I had taken off my clothes and my handkerchief off my neck, and my watch was in my pocket.
Where did you put your breeches
I put them on the bed with the watch in them; I awoke between seven and eight o'clock in the morning, the prisoner was gone; I searched my breeches pocket; my watch, and my handkerchief I took off my neck was gone. I had a seven shilling piece and some silver; the seven shilling piece was gone; four shillings had dropped on the floor.
Did you ever find your property again
Yes. I found the watch at the pawnbrokers; I went to all the pawnbrokers I could, I gave them the maker's name and the number, for them to detain any person that offered to pledge it.
Are you certain the prisoner is the woman
Yes.
I am apprentice to Mary Ann Franck Rochfort , pawnbroker, 34, Jermyn-street, St. James's; this watch was brought on Monday at one o'clock by the prisoner; by an information that I received from the prosecutor, I stopped the watch and the woman; she told me that a man had asked her to bring it to pledge, and she was to have seven shillings for her trouble, with which she was going to take a gown out of pledge.
When the pawnbroker asked me where I had the watch from, I told him from a man in a leather apron, he gave it me to pledge; he stood at the corner, I went to the door to look for him, he told me not to go out; I came back and told him not to send for a constable, I would go with him any where and fetch the man; I came with him from Kingsland.
