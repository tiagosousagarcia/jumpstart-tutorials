I am a tobacconist , in Grice's-alley, Wellclose-square : The prisoner lived servant with me nine months; she had eloped for a week, and in the course of my enquiries after her, I learned that she was in a miserable situation, dreadfully diseased; I got her into the work-house, and my own doctor attended her; she sent for some clothes out of the box, when the things were discovered.
I found in her box an old pocket, a piece of cotton, a prayer-book, and the other things named in the indictment.
I am an officer, the box was opened in my presence, she herself said it was her box; these things were found in it, (produces them) . They were deposed to by Mrs. Curtis.
The prisoner said she was very sorry for it, she said, she had taken a great deal of tobacco, and given it away.
