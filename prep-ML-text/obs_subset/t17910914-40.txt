I live in Newgate-street , I am a mercer ; Mary Smith came into my shop on the 25th of July, early in the morning, about nine o'clock, and asked to see some black lace; my boy shewed her, she asked to have some measured, and while he turned his back to get the yard to measure it, he suspected she stole some lace; she had that however, and paid seven pence halfpenny for it, in the mean time I came into the shop and asked him for some muslin, and she had so much as came to sixpence; she went out of the shop, and my boy told me that he suspected that she stole a card of lace; he ran after her, and brought her back.
I am shopman to Mr. Weightman; this woman came into the shop about nine o'clock in the morning, and asked for some lace; I asked her to walk in, and she bought about a yard and a quarter; I turned round to measure it: and when I turned again I suspected her, she having her hand in her pocket-hole; my master came in, and she had six pennyworth of muslin, and went out, and I told my master, and I went out after her, and overtook her in Pye-corner, and told her my master wanted to speak to her; she said my master might come to her; she came down half way Giltspur-street, and went back again, and went to a house in Pye-corner, and attempted to knock at the door, but did not; and I went to her and followed her down Cock-lane, where I told her what I thought of her; and then she told me she would turn back, and see if master could find any thing on her; with that when I got into Giltspur-street, I went to walk behind her, but she would not let me; so I continued to walk before her, till I got to the New Compter, when there was a woman that came with a basket upon her head, and she appeared to cling close to her side; and just as I came to the corner, she pulled the hand out of her pocket, and threw the lace down in the street, and I picked it up.
I took the woman into custody, I was sent for to the shop, and the woman and the lace were both there, and she said she was sorry for it, and acknowledged she had taken it.
I know nothing of it; I never confessed I took it.
