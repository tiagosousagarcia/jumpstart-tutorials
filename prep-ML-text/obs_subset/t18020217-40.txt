On Thursday the 28th of January, I was going to the Public-office, Worship-street, between five and six o'clock in the evening, I saw the prisoner, and another, standing with their backs towards the next shop to Mrs. Hocknell's, in Shoreditch ; I saw the prisoner draw this piece of ribbon through the screw hole of the window, I did not see what he did it with; the boy that was with him had a hook, but I did not see it; the prisoner ran across the road with it, and in running away with it he fell down in the road; I crossed, picked him up, and brought him into the shop, with the ribbons upon him. (Produces them).
I know these ribbons to be my property, I have no particular mark upon them; I am positive I put such ribbons in the window in the morning, I had left the shop about five minutes before, and had removed these ribbons about an inch from the screw hole.
I work in the brick-fields; I was going along, and met another boy, and while I was speaking to him this gentleman came up, and said I had stole the ribbon.
