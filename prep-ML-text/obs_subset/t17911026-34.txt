I live in Broker's-alley, Drury-lane ; about eight in the evening on the 4th of October I sent out my little daughter to order some beer, and I sat on the stairs to watch the door till her return; she shut the door after her, and in about a minute the door began to shift a good deal, and a man put his two hands under the door, and wrenched it open, and he took it in his arms, and put it on the spring again, and turned into the shop. I immediately got assistance, and secured him. About ten I found this parcel, but I did not see him throw it down: it contains a lanthorn and a tinder-box.
I am daughter of the prosecutor, I am turned fifteen, I fastened the door by the spring, I am sure of that; I saw the prisoner at the top of the court when I went out, I am sure it was him, I never saw him before, it was a dark night.
I shut up the shop in the evening, and left all the property secure.
I took the prisoner, I searched him, and looked about the shop, and found nothing,
Coming into Broad-street, St. Giles's, a man said he wanted to sell his room of goods, and desired me to call on one Johnson in Broker's-alley, I went to the prosecutor, and the door was open, and they took me into custody.
Court to Sarah Tunstie . Was the prisoner with any other men at the end of the court?
Yes, two more.
