I am foreman to Mr. Richard Cooke: On Saturday, the 12th of June, we had a quantity of coffee upon Bear-quay ; about five o'clock in the morning, I received information that one of the bags of coffee was cut; I went down to the quay, and found the prisoner in custody; part of the coffee was in the watchman's apron, and the other part was in the prisoner's hat; that part, which was in the prisoner's hat, I put into my apron; I delivered it to the officer; it was raw coffee, of the same quality with that in the bag; it was very indifferent coffee, what they call exportation-coffee; I had trusted the prisoner with a great variety of goods, and always found him very honest till this time; he was not under the employment of Mr. Cooke when this happened.
I am a watchman: On the 12th of June, between three and four o'clock in the morning, I was going round, and saw a bag of coffee cut; there were about a hundred bags one upon another; I then saw the prisoner concealed between a bag of coffee and some casks; I pulled him out, and searched him; I found a quantity of coffee in his breeches, and in his trowsers, and different parts about him; he then begged of me to let him go; I took him into custody, and delivered the coffee into the custody of the street-keeper.
This is the same sort of coffee that was in the bag.
This coffee was given to me upon the wharf.
