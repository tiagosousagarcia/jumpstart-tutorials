You are in partnership with Charles Lancaster as pawnbrokers .
Yes, No. 42, Old Compton street, St. Ann's Soho . I reside in the house, Mr. Lancaster resides elsewhere.
Has the prisoner for a short time past lived in your service.
Yes, she came on the 15th of December.
On the 7th of this month, in consequence of any thing that occurred, did you go up stairs to search her box.
I did, Mrs. Barker and one of my journeymen went with me. I asked her for the key of her box in the parlour, before I went up stairs; she said that she would take me up stairs and open the box herself. When I got up stairs she pretended that she had left the key in the kitchen, she went down stairs and came up again, and said that she could not find it, she must have left it in the room; she went away again, and took me to the bed room twice.
Where was her box.
In the bed room. After she had been in the kitchen a second time, she said she could not find the key, she desired me to break the box open with the poker, which she took from the kitchen in her hand; after a great deal of hesitation she put her hand into her pocket, took out the key of her trunk, and likewise the key of my warehouse.
Where was she then.
In the kitchen; this was the duplicate key, we have two keys to the warehouse, they are kept in a secret place in the shop.
Had she any business either in your shop or in your warehouse.
No. When she gave me the key she opened the box, and this kerseymere pelisse laid at the top, it is an article that I took in pledge, with a muslin gown; these two articles were missing. I found this shawl in the box, and this cloak I believe to be an article that was in the warehouse; this silk cotton handkerchief was in the box, and four duplicates of things pawned at other pawnbrokers; on these things being found in her box she begged for mercy and went down on her knees, and hoped I would forgive her, and attempted to run away, and said she must have been in liquor when she took them. She said that she had taken the pelisse the evening before I had detected her.
Your partner's name is Charles Lancaster , is no other person interested in your business.
No.
I am a constable, I produce twenty-eight duplicates.
There are only four of them applicable to this charge, were these four found in her box.
Yes.
