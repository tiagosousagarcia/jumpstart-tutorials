The prisoner was my servant : she had lived with me about four months, at South-gate, in the parish of Edmonton . The first thing I lost was a bit of Brussels lace, which was about two months ago. The other things were lost about six weeks ago: they were lost at different times. She found means to open my drawers, and take out three guineas and a half.
How came you to suspect her?
Her having so many new things: I knew she had no way of getting them, but dishonestly. I sent for a constable; I searched her box when she and the constable were present; I found this apron in her box (producing it) and some other trifling things. I charged her with taking the apron: at first she denied it; but afterwards she did confess that she took it out of the wash.
Did you say it would be better for her to confess?
No.
Did you threaten, if she would not confess, that you would put the law in force against her?
I threatened she should be punished; I made no agreement with regard to shewing her any lenity.
What do you know of her taking the money?
We found a false key in her pocket, which, upon trial, opened my drawers. She confessed she took three guineas and a half, which was the sum I missed: I had taken out all but that. She said she had laid out a guinea and a half upon herself; that she sent the lace as a present to a woman that received goods from her, with two guineas of the money. She said the woman had threatened, that, if she did not get some money or something for her, she would kill her.
What age is the prisoner?
About seventeen.
I am not sixteen till next Michaelmas. They drawed it out by main force: my master and mistress promised to forgive me: my mistress said she would make me suffer for it, if I did not tell her. I know nothing at all of it.
Had you a character with her?
Yes; from a person she lived a very short time with.
