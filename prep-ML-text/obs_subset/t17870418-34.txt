I live at No. 1, Hanover-court, Grub-street ; on the 26th of February I was at home; at seven in the evening, Elizabeth Drake , a lodger of mine, and my wife went out and left me at home; about five minutes after, a little boy of mine came in and said, daddy, there is a man in the passage; the child is about twelve years old; accordingly I went down stairs, and put the child out of the door, and bid him go to a neighbour's opposite and stay there; the prisoner was on the outside of the door then; the door was open; I withdrew and went to the further end of the passage, and I no sooner got there, but the prisoner came in and tried a key to the parlour door about a minute; he then went out and came in again immediately, and repeated that four or five different times; he tried the key each time; I was not six feet from him all the time, and I think the fourth or fifth time that he tried, Mrs. Elizabeth Drake came to the door and stopped him; then I took him.
I went out with Mrs. Ninns, and shut the street door after us upon the latch, and latched it.
Are you sure you shut it after you?
Yes.
Who shut it?
I did.
You pulled it to?
Yes, very hard indeed; I went away directly.
I went out with Elizabeth Drake; she pulled it very hard, and I said, have you shut the door? and she tried it; and I looked back and saw her try it.
She does not say that, we cannot take more from you than what she says herself.
You did not try it yourself?
No.
I was sent for by the prosecutor to take charge of the prisoner; and the prosecutor gave me this key, which he said he found in the parlour door; I took this other key out of his pocket, and this bag, a large bag, and nothing in the bag; the key I found in his pocket is a fair key, but the other is not.
I took that key out of the parlour door.
He found no key in my pocket.
What o'clock was it?
It was exactly two minutes after seven when he came into the entry; I looked at my watch; there was no day-light; it was quite dark before that.
