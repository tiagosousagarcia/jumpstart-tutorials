I am an auctioneer in the Piazza, Covent Garden . I lost a cornelian seal, set in gold, out of an iron safe, out of the counting-house adjoining my house. The prisoner is a carpenter ; he with his master had been at work four days; the prisoner was left alone. I left my key in the iron safe, and went out. I saw the seal a month before. I saw the seal at the office before the magistrate; Mr. Heather had stopped him; it is a white cornelian seal, set in gold; I have no doubt it is mine; it is a very remarkable seal; I had it engraved myself.
I live in Long-Acre; I am a pawnbroker. The prisoner brought the seal, and said, he had found it two days before at Temple-Bar. I told him, I would go to Sir Sampson, and see if it was advertised, and if there was any reward, he should have it; and going through Broad-Court, he made a sudden stop, and said, he would go no further. I then suspected him, and took him to Bow-street; he said there, he had found it. I have known the man several years; he has worked for me; I had no suspicion he had stolen it at first. He has a wife and four children. Mr. Robins was sent for, and owned the seal. I have had it in my custody ever since. This is the seal.
I am very sorry for what I have done; I never was before a magistrate before.
He is an old man, my Lord; I wish to recommend him to your Lordship and the Jury as an object of mercy.
Your offence has been attended with some circumstances of aggravation; for a man who is employed in the manner in which you was, though not a direct servant, it comes very near to it; and it is very difficult to guard our property against persons that are let into our houses; and the Court would have been disposed to have treated your case very seriously, but we flatter ourselves it is the first time; the sentence of the Court therefore is, that you be confined one month in Newgate , and he fined one shilling .
