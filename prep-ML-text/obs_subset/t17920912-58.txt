I am servant to Joseph Miller and George Wright ; they are in business together; they keep a button warehouse, and silk manufactory ; on Friday morning last, the 14th of September, the silk was taken from the warehouse of Miller and Wright, in the dwelling house of Thomas Wardale; between seven and eight in the morning the prisoner came into the warehouse, and asked to look at some sewing silk; I reached down a large wrapper of sewing silk; he then looked out some for me to weigh; while I was weighing it, I perceived the prisoner put his hand in the wrapper, take out some silk, and put it into his right-hand pocket; I then told my fellow servant, John Elliott ; then I sent for a constable to search the prisoner; I saw him searched, and out of his right-hand pocket, the constable took some silk; and out of his left pocket he took some; in all it was one pound three-quarters; we sell it at 18 s. a pound, we value it at 40 s. the prisoner said it was his own property, he had been several times in our warehouse; that silk in the right-hand pocket, which I saw him take, is not separated from the other which was in the left-hand pocket, I do not swear to.
