On the 18th of September, about a quarter after seven in the evening, at the bottom of Snow-Hill , I saw a boy take a box from the basket of the Southampton coach, and give it to the prisoner, who ran away with it; the boy got out of the basket and also ran away; the prisoner ran down Fleet-market with the box; I followed him; when he saw me follow him he turned aside, and asked me what I wanted with him; I said he had got a box which did not belong to him; the prisoner said it was his own. I attempted to lay hold of him; he crossed over to Mr. Langdale's buildings; just then Mr. Wilkins came up, and stopped him with the bundle.
How came you not to stop the coach?
I called out to the coachman, but the coach was driving on, and he did not hear me.
On the 18th of September, in the evening, standing at the corner of Plumbtree-court , Holbourn-Bridge, in consequence of something I was told by a Mr. Hastings who is not here, I saw the prisoner and followed him; the prisoner had a deal box on his shoulder; I stopped him and carried him to the Three Tuns, and delivered the box and him to Mr. Green, the constable; the box is directed to Mr. Jennings, No. 85, Watling-Street.
I am book-keeper to the Southampton coach, Mr. Collier is proprietor of it; an enquiry was made for this box, and it was not forthcoming.
A gentleman asked me to carry the box for him; being an hard-working lad I was willing to earn a shilling; the gentleman followed me up Fleet-market; Mr. Harper stopped me, and said the box was not mine; the gentleman ran away; I told Mr. Harper that it belonged to that gentleman.
Did he tell you about any gentleman to whom the box belonged?
No; he said it was his own property.
