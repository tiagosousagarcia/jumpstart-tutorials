I am the wife of Samuel Chandler ; the
23d of June the prisoner came to one Mrs. Chapman, who is a witness here, I employed her to wash the things mentioned in the indictment, and these things were in the bed room of a young man that lodges with me; I saw the prisoner go up stairs to Mrs. Chapman's door, from the back room, and I saw the things just before I gave the prisoner the handkerchiefs to take into the back room to wash, and she hung up the shirt there herself.
I lodge in the two pair of stairs; I remember the prisoner coming to our house, she came up stairs, and brought a handkerchief; when I saw her in the gaol, she said she put the other things in the back cupboard; we went and searched, and could not find them; she never produced them afterwards.
I never touched the handkerchief nor apron, nor took them out of the place; my husband keeps another woman in Ratcliff-highway, and I went after him, and he advised these people to take me up, and to put me into the Tower gaol.
Do you know any thing of this?
I never saw the prisoner's husband till I saw him on the Wednesday morning; he said I must not seek to him for any recompence.
I have not a friend in the world, nor I have not had a bit of any thing but a bit of dry bread.
