On the 4th of December, I called at the public-house the sign of the Conduit, the corner of Conduit-street, Swallow-street ; I had a goose, four turkeys, and a side of mutton, and three cloths in a basket; I took a goose into the tap-room to shew the landlord, the landlord and I could not agree; I put it into the basket and went back, and called for a pint of beer and left the basket with the property in the passage, and when I went into the tap this Savage was there; he came out unknown to me, and when I came out, my basket was gone, with the contents.
I am a painter, I was at work at this public-house at the time this man missed his basket, I went with two more to find him; we went from this house in Swallow-street to Berwick-street, we found his wife down in a cellar in Peter-street, we asked if that was Savage's; she said, yes; we asked for some oysters, we wanted to have them in the cellar, she refused us going down into the cellar; I fled down, and crossed to the bed-room in the cellar, and undeneath the bed, I pulled out the basket, with three turkeys and two quarters of mutton; I said to my friends, we do not want oysters, here is enough; there were only two cloths, one cloth was gone with the turkey and goose; we sent for a constable to take the woman to the Magistrate's, she was committed for re-examination; coming from the office we met Savage, and we took him there, and the Justice released the woman and put Savage in her place; the property was given to Powell, as the goods were perishable. (The basket produced, and identified by the prosecutor.)
I did not take them: On Tuesday, the 4th of December, I was out cutting of wood, as I had no work to do at home; I was not in my stall at all; I am a shoe-maker, and about four o'clock I went home to shut my place, being dark, and there was a coachman in Bond-street waiting for a pair of shoes that I had to mend; I was going with them to his stable-yard, two men followed me; they took hold of me, and said, I must go along with them; they said, they had got the old b - h.
