I live in Trump-street, Honey-lane Market , I am a butterman and cheesemonger ; on Monday week the 12th instant, about twenty minutes before nine o'clock in the evening, I was in Milk-street, Cheapside, I had not been gone ten minutes before I was sent after, and was informed that I had lost a quantit
I am servant to Mr. Hubbard, poulterer, a neighbour opposite to Mr. Thomas: I was at my own shop, I saw this here prisoner take the flat of butter up.
What time of the day was it.
About twenty minutes before nine o'clock at night; he walked gently down the left hand side of Trump-street with it, I walked after him, hearing his shoes, another behind whistled, as soon as he heard the whistle he dropped the flat of butter, I hallooed out Stop thief; soon after he was taken.
Did you lose sight of him.
No, he was brought back and the butter too, there was no soul in the street but him and another man.
I think he is swearing very false.
I am a constable; on Monday, the 12th instant, I was sent for by Mr. Thomas to come to his shop, the prisoner and the butter was in Mr. Thomas's shop; I produce the flat and the cloth. (The property identified by the prosecutor.)
I have just come from Ireland, I have been out of the kingdom twelve years, I have been in Egypt and every where, as I was going down this street, when the word Stop thief was cried out, I ran as well as the rest; this boy swore that he never lost sight of me, he said to the alderman that he lost sight of me for ten minutes, and that I had a white coat on; there were two hundred people in the street besides me.
It is a short street, there could not be two hundred people at that time of the night.
This boy will swear any thing.
