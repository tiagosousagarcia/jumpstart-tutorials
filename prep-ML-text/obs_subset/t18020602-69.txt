My husband, Thomas Surguy , keeps a shoemaker's-shop , at No. 12, Old-Tothill-street, Westminster : on Sunday morning, the 16th of May, between nine and ten, the prisoner asked me for a pair of shoes; I reached two or three pair down, and she said none of them fitted her; she was sorry she had given me the trouble, as she was going out of town: A gentleman, who stood outside the door, watched her, and saw her put a pair under her apron; he told me of it, and the apprentice and I followed her; I took them from her, and they were the first pair I had shewn her.(The constable produced the shoes, which were identified.)
As I went past the shop, I took the shoes off the step; a gentleman said they were his; I said they were not, and walked on; then he went in and told the people of the shop.
Were any shoes at the door?
No; they were the shoes I had reached down, and I took them from under her apron.
