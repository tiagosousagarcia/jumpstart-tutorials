I am a pewterer , at No. 61, Whitecross-street ; the prisoner was a labourer to me for upwards of seven years: On the 7th of December, he was detected with the pewter.
I am a journeyman to Mr. Hodge, and had a suspicion of the prisoner; I marked a pewter plate, and put it on the drawers in the shop at watering time; I staid to watch, but it remained till next day; I did not stay to watch that day, but when I came back to work, I missed it; one of my shop-mates came to me, and we informed my master, and after work we hustled the prisoner as he went out, and felt the pewter; he fell down on his knees, and said, O Lord, O Lord, what shall I do? The plate was found between his waistcoat and shirt, and a quantity of small pieces in his breeches, above nine pounds; we found at his lodgings a piece of metal in a closet, melted in a frying-pan.
