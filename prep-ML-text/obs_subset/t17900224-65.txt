On the 24th of February I was on the wharf, and saw the prisoner at the bar coming out of Lion's-key, Loop-hole , which at the first leads into a cellar, where are many casks of sugar, all under the care of our gang, which is twelve: I went to him, and found his hands appeared sugary; I then took hold of him, and asked him what he had been doing? he said nothing; I told him he must be doing something; I found in his breeches a bag of sugar, concealed; on that I took him along the key; and the constable, Samuel Allen , came up, and I gave him to him; the constable and I, after we had took the man, took some sugar out of a hogshead, whose head had been knocked in, and it matched; I had never seen that hogshead before I went in to examine.
How far is the Loop-hole from the cellar?
About a yard and a half; he seemed to wish to conceal himself by it: after he had got to the counter he said, that a cooper told him to go in and take this sugar.
I am a constable. I was a walking along the keys, and Mr. Vantris give me the charge; and he gave me the sugar out of his breeches; and I took more sugar out of his pocket, which was loose; and it is in this handkerchief.
I have worked for Mr. Vantris six or seven years; and he knows nothing of me before this, but that I was very honest; and I should not have done it, but I was drunk.
