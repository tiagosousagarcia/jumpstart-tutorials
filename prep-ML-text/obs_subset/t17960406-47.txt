I know the prisoner at the bar; I was present in December sessions, 1794, when he received sentence of transportation; he is the man, (produces the certificate of his conviction, signed by Mr. Shelton, the officer of this court. It is read)
I am a carrier: on the 18th of February, I was up with my waggon in Bond-street; I left the boy feeding the horses; when I came back there was a man had taken a box out of the waggon; I went after him and took him, and he cut me with a knife, very much, and two or three more; but we secured him; he cut my hand all across, and my head, very much; I almost bled to death; and one of the witnesses has lost the use of two of his fingers.
