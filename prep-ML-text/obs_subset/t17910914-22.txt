The prisoner took my one pair of stairs back-room at three shillings and sixpence per week; she was backwards and forwards for three weeks, I missed nothing till after she was gone; we missed the things in the indictment, we found them at the pawnbroker's.
I am a pawnbroker; in June, July, and August last, the prisoner pledged the things in the indictment at my house. (The counterpane produced and deposed to.) One of the sheets was pledged the 16th, another the 20th, and the counterpane the 23rd of June.
I am the constable, I took her, she acknowledged that every thing that was produced was Mrs. Vyse's.
I did it through distress, my husband was very bad in the hospital, he is dead since I was here; I have no witnesses but myself and God.
