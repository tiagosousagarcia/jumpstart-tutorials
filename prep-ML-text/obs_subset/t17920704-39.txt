I lost a bridle and saddle on the 27th of February; I got them again from Lucas.
I found Mr. L'Homme's bridle and saddle at Calne; I had it from Mr. Burgess.
That man, Jack Jones , brought a bridle and saddle to my mistress's house; I gave him 15 s. for it; I sold it to a farmer for the same money I gave for it. I know the prisoner; I knew him when I came into court; I never saw him before that time.
I have had the saddle these three years.
On the 27th of February, the prisoner Jones, and Bath and I, broke open the stable of Mr. L'Homme, and stole one horse, a bridle and saddle, and rode the horse into the country, and sold it to one farmer Pellit.
Did you always swear in that kind of way?
I always swore the same.
It is not feasible that I should go to steal things without see or reward.
