I keep a lodging house for seafaring men at Wapping Dock street. I met two men in Nightingale lane ; the prisoner gave the other man that was with with me a blow; he run away and cried out murder; then he turned to me and lifted up a blow at my head; I turned my arm up and kept the blow off; the other man, with the prisoner, took my hat off, and the prisoner ran away with it.
Where was his hat
He had his hat off.
Had you any quarrel with him before
No; I never saw him before. He was taken with the hat.
You went to a public house in Nightingale lane with a friend
Yes.
The sailor was there with his friend
I never saw him in the house.
Did not the prisoner say, when he was charged with this, he took this hat up for his friend's hat
No.
It was so dark that a man might have mistook the hat, and not have known it was your's
Yes. I cannot say.
I was going home on that night, about half past nine, I stopped under the gateway; I heard the cry of murder in the street; the rattles sprang in all directions; at that moment the prisoner came by me and went up a court with this stick and a hat, they were concealed under a large jacket, which sailor's wear; he endeavoured to hide himself behind some carts; I catched hold of the stick. When the watchmen came by, I said, you must be the man that they are looking after, and this is an unlawful weapon; then a scuffle ensued between him and me, I still kept hold of the stick; he ran; I cried out stop thief; he was stopped immediately. The prosecutor owned the hat.
So that stick you call an unlawful weapon - do not you know that is a common stick for a foreign sailor to have
That is for the judgment of the court.
What altercation had taken place before this you do not know
No.
That old hat is not worth a shilling
I do not know that it is.
I have been three weeks in this country. When I came out of the public house we had a few words together, and we had a scuffle; I took the hat for mine as I was in liquor.
