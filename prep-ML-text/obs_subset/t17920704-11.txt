I keep the Fountain in Shire Lane . The prisoner came in, and called for a pint of beer; I asked him to sit down in the bar; he came in, and had another pint, and I asked him to have some tea; and after that he had another pint. During the time he was there, I had recourse frequently to the bag in which the bank-notes and cash were, to give change, which was kept in a drawer. After some time the prisoner went out, and said he would come in again and pay for his beer; he did not return. I saw him about six weeks afterwards; I asked him what he had been doing with himself all that time; he said he hoped I would forgive him. I saw him first at Union Hall, and afterwards at Bow-street. (The confession produced.) William Perry signed it, and so did I.
