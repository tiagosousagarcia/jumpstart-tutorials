I am shopman to Mr. Potter, Bishopsgate Without, No. 40 , grocer and tea-dealer . On Wednesday, the 20th of July, about nine in the evening, I was serving a person, and the prisoner at the bar was walking by the door in the street, upon the pavement, for some time, and when I had served the customer, he attempted to take a loaf of sugar that was standing on a chest of tea about two yards in the shop; after that, just as I had served the woman, he came and took it off the chest, and ran out, and I ran after him, and I apprehended him immediately. He just ran round the window, and got up a passage, and a person stopped him with the loaf, and he threw it down, and the person marked it in my presence; I saw the loaf of sugar on the ground close by, but it was rather dark in the passage; I did not see him drop it, it was about six yards from our shop, up Catherine-wheel-alley. I am certain to the boy.
I produce the sugar I received form Mr. Rose.
