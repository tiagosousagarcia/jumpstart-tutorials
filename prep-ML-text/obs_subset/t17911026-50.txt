I was at the Marquis of Granby, Piccadilly , with Smith, at twelve o'clock at night, he was a little tosticated, I heard him abuse a young man, he struck a young man in the face without any provocation; he fell sick, and went out to puke at the door; the prisoner said, how can you be so dirty? then Smith followed him into the road, and struck Bromley. I took the deceased into the house, about four o'clock the prisoner came into the house to eat some bread and cheese, the deceased took up a shovel, and said d - n and b - st you, I will cut your bloody head; the prisoner then went and fetched a broom, with which he gave the unfortunate blow, it was a long hair broom.
I am pot-boy, the deceased was at our house the 18th of October, he used very bad words, and beat the prisoner; I did not see any blows pass, I was about my master's business, and did not mind.
I am servant at the Marquis of Granby, I let the prisoner in, he quarrelled with one George, and struck him, he was in liquor. When George came in he called for a pint of beer. I did not see the prisoner strike him; about four o'clock the deceased went out of doors, and the waterman (the prisoner) said, what are you nasty for? the deceased was taken to the hospital.
I am surgeon at the hospital, I received the deceased, the fracture was the cause of his death.
The deceased abused and struck me several times; I said, Smith, I will not be struck and knocked about so; he would not desist, I turned my hand, laid hold of the broom, and gave him the unfortunate blow. God knows my heart did not mean to kill him.
