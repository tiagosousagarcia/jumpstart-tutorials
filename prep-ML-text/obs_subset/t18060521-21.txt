I live in Oxford-street, I am shopman to Charles Price . On Saturday the 17th of this month, I saw the prisoner standing close to our window.
I suppose you have linen drapery goods hanging about your window.
We have; she went suddenly from the window, I went after her on suspicion, I found a piece of printed cotton under her arm under her cloak, I brought her back to the shop, and Mr. Charles Price sent for an officer.
You took the printed cotton from her.
I did, I knew it to be my master's, we measured it over, it measured twenty-five yards.
You say that she suddenly went off, you do not mean to say that she ran off.
No.
When you came up to her I believe that she told you that she had it given to her.
She did.
You charged her with the property, she without being confused admitted that she had it.
I did not say she was confused.
How long before had you seen this property at the window.
I cannot tell, I had not seen it that day.
Although you were attending to her you did not see her take it.
No.
You say you venture to swear to this property, if you had gone into any place whatever, and you had seen this cotton produced, could you have ventured to have sworn to it.
If it had my employer's mark on it, if I had known that he had not sold it.
Therefore you cannot be confident of what is sold but by yourself, other persons sell in the shop as well as yourself.
Yes.
You can only swear that you did not sell it, but you cannot swear that any other person might not have sold it.
I cannot.
The other shopmen are not here.
They did not see any thing of the transaction.
That you do not know, nor whether they had sold it you do not know.
No.
I took the girl in custody on Saturday the 17th of May; the cotton was delivered to me by William Price ; I produce it. (The property identified by William Price .)
