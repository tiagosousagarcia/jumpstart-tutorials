I was the wife of Abraham Shuttleworth, he has died since I lost these things; I was in service, I came out of place and went to lodge with the prisoner, I knew her before: On the 7th of July, I went home about half-past eight in the evening, and found the door locked; I had left these things hanging in the room, at five o'clock; the prisoner went by the name of Scales there, she never re turned afterwards; I broke open the door in the presence of the landlord, and missed my things; I went in search of her, but did not find her till the Sunday week following; I took her at her mother's place in Swallow-street; she directed me to three different pawnbrokers, where I found the things.
