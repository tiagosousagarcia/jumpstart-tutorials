- I was in the late 24th regiment , and missed my shirt of the 5th of December, from my quarters, at the Three Crowns in Chelsea ; the prisoner lay in the same room with me; I never found the shirt, but he acknowledged to having taken it, and gave the duplicate to a black man, which we have here.
I took the prisoner into custody, and produce the duplicate.
- I am a pawnbroker, the shirt was taken in of a woman.(The shirt produced and identified.)
I bought the duplicate of a man who lodged in the house, and gave him two shillings for it.
