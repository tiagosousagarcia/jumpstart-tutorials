Yesterday afternoon I saw two women in Jewin-street, with a piece of carpeting; one of them said to the other, d - n your eyes, it will be seen. John Willcox was with me. As we were going through the court the other woman shoved us, and the prisoner in the mean time ran off with the carpeting; this is it (producing it) . She had it in her apron, she carried it and hid it in Paul's-Head-alley; then she came and beckoned to the other to follow her. We went into the alley and found the carpeting in the passage of a place called the Timber Yard, opposite the meeting-door. The prisoner ran away when she saw us coming after her. We took the carpeting and ran after the prisoner and secured her.
I keep an open shop in St. Martin's-Le-Grand . I believe this carpeting to be mine. I lost such a piece; there is no mark on it. It contains 27 yards, half-ell.
I live at the other end of the town; I dress dolls .
