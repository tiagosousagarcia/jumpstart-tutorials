I am a single woman: On the 22d of July, I came up from Blackmore, in Essex, to see my sister, who lives at the back of Baker's-row, Whitechapel ; I saw the prisoner there; I asked for a lodging, and she said I might sleep with her; when I waked in the morning, she was gone, and all my clothes, expect my stays and]an old petticoat; she was found the Sunday following, by a young woman, in Whitechapel, and taken to the watch-house; I saw her in the watch-house with my bonnet and apron upon her.
I am a constable: I was sent for to the watch-house, the prisoner was there, I took the honest and the apron from her.(Produces them).
She lent me the bonnet, and the apron; the other things I know nothing about; there were two more women slept with her all night.
How came you not to sleep at youe sisters's?
She was gone out of town with her family, for a month.
