I lost a carpet on the 1st of February; the value of it is 39 s.
I am workwoman to Mr. Slidstone: there were two men together; one came into the shop on the 1st of February, about eleven o'clock, and took the carpet on his shoulder; I ran after him; the man who was on the outside is the prisoner; he took it of the other; they walked down the street; he was taken within five doors; the prisoner had the carpet on his shoulder when he was taken; I am sure the prisoner is the person.
I was coming along Long-acre, about eleven o'clock, on the 1st of February; I saw the prisoner running; he fell just as he came up to me; I heard Mrs. Harvey call out stop thief! I took him by the collar, and took him back to Slidstone's shop; and from thence he was taken before Sir Sampson Wright.
I was going on an errand for my master to St. Martin's-lane, and a man tapped me on the shoulder and asked me to carry this carpet to St. Martin's-lane, and said he would give me a shilling; and when this gentlewoman cried stop thief! the man run away; I was not near the house.
