I am a poor man; I lost the articles from my place; I keep a cellar, and sell garden-stuff and greens ; I left the prisoner there, while I went with a message, the 6th of February, on a Wednesday; I left him between two and three o'clock, very near three o'clock; when I came back, he was gone; I did not miss any thing; my wife missed the things when she came home, and then I knew they were gone; two half calico shawls, a quarter of a pound of Souchong tea, and seven pawnbroker's duplicates; the shawls were in a box, and the duplicates in a little box inside another box, and the tea in a canister, on the table; I have never recovered any thing but the duplicates, and a little of the tea loose in his pocket; my wife catched him in Cranbourn-alley; my house is in Duke-street, St. James's; I saw them taken out of his pocket; he was brought home to my place in a little better than an hour; they were taken from his left-hand pocket; the tea was common brown tea; I had known him six years ago, and had not seen him till this day since.
I was coming along Duke-street, and there were a great many people about the prosecutor's door, and they had got the man; I searched him, and took this box, containing these duplicates, out of his pocket; there was some tea, but such a little, it could not be discerned what tea it was.
Were all the things pawned in your own name?
Yes; they were pawned in Cranbourn-alley.
I found it going into the prosecutor's house from easing myself, and I went immediately to seek after work; and in about an hour, in Cranbourn-alley, I met the prosecutor's wife, and I told her then, as I had but just looked at it, that I had picked up a box and the contents; she said she had lost many things else, and if I would tell her where they were, she would forgive me.
