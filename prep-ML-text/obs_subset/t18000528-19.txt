I am a pawnbroker, No. 1, Sherrard-street, Golden-square, I know the prisoner perfectly well; on the 1st of March, I took in from the prisoner at the bar, two table-cloths and two silk gowns, for three pounds ten shillings; I am sure she is the person, she had been frequently at our shop before.
Was she not frequently in the habit of redeeming things?
Yes.
The prisoner was my maid and house-keeper.
Your husband is the Hon. John Stratford ?
Yes; she had been five months in my service; I missed a great number of things, and at the latter end of April, in consequence of some suspicions that I entertained, the prisoner was apprehended.
Look at these things produced by Mr. Gordon?
Here are two silk gowns, they are my property which I have lost; these two table-cloths are mine; they are the same pattern with many that I have lost, but they have no mark upon them; the gowns were made for me, I wore them some time.
Upon the tablecloth you have no mark?
No.
As she had a controul over your property, she might have taken one gown at one time, and the other at another?
She might.
I have known the prisoner some years; I have trusted her with large sums of money, and always had a very good opinion of her.
