I am shopman to Mr. Lewis, who keeps a linen warehouse opposite the Mansion-house On the 6th of October , while I was writing in the warehouse, in a place which commanded a full view of the door, I heard the feet of a man in the warehouse; I looked up immediately and saw a man walk out with a parcel of linen under his arm; he crossed the way; I followed him till I came up to him; I never lost sight of him only while I got up from my feat. I seised him by the collar; he turned round, let the cloth fall, and struck me on the breast. There were ten pieces of cloth. After he had struck me he put himself in a fighting posture; I returned the blow, and he stumbled off the pavement, and then ran away. I pursued him immediately; he ran round the Mansion-house up Lombard-street, up a passage. When I came up to him I seised him by the collar; I knew him immediately to be the man, who had struck me and had the cloth. under his arm. I brought him back to the warehouse, and sent for a constable. A neighbour who saw the transaction took up the linen and brought it into the warehouse.
Are you sure the prisoner is the man you first laid hold of and who dropped the pieces and struck you?
Yes, I am sure of that.
Upon the 6th of this month I saw Mr. Potter attack a person, who had got a parcel of linen under his arm. I saw the man drop the linen. Seeing a scuffle ensue, I went immediately to secure the linen. The person ran away , and Mr. Potter pursued him.
Was it the man Mr. Potter attacked who dropped the linen?
Yes, it was.
Do you know whether the man Mr. Potter brought back was the man who dropped the linen?
I cannot say that, I was not near enough to know. I kept the linen in my possession till it was produced before the Lord Mayor; then I made my private mark upon it. This is the linen.
I leave my defence to my counsel.
Where is the warehouse?
Opposite the Mansion-house.
Where is Mr. Lewis's house?
Part over it and part on the side of it.
