I am a shoe-maker , at No. 9, Phoenix-street, St. Giles's. On the 2d of October, a little after one in the morning, as I was coming home to my own house, five women came out of Coventry-court , and laid hold of me. They pulled me about, struck me, and used me exceeding ill; and they took by force 28 s. a guinea, two half-crowns, and 2 s. out of my pocket. They got me down on the ground. I called out for the watch, and cried out, Murder!
Did you represent your case thus when you preferred the indictment?
Yes.
Had you no conversation with any one of them?
No: they all came upon me together.
Did you know any of them?
No; I never saw them in my life. I catched the prisoner's hand in my pocket. I did not loose her hand. Another woman took the money from her. They said, they would cut my hand off, to make me loose my hand. At last, a watchman came. One of the women went to him, and, I believe, gave him something; upon which he said, It was out of his beat, and he would not assist me. I kept hold of the prisoner till another person came and secured her.
Was you sober, or in liquor?
As sober as I am this minute: I had only supped with my landlord, and drank part of two pots of beer between five of us.
Did you see her give the money to the other woman?
Yes; it was a very moonlight night.
I never saw the gentleman till he laid hold of me in the Hay-market, and they said I was one of the women; that was after he called the watch. I went up the court, to see what he called about, and he said I was one of the women.
To the Prosecutor. Are you sure you never loosed her till you called the watch?
I am sure of it. They beat me, and kicked me; and when the watch came, the others ran away.
