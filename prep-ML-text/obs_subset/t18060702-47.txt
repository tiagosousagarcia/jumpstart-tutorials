I am a smith , the prisoner was in my employ five months as a labourer ; I sent the prisoner of a message, he was apprehended by a constable, who took some property from him; I found him about ten minutes after he was out of my shop in the watchhouse, in the custody of the constable, he was searched in my presence, and some cuttings of iron were found in his pocket, and then his lodgings were searched.
I am a constable.
Had you occasion to pass Mr. Walker's manufactory.
Yes, about five o'clock in the afternoon on the 2d of June, I saw the prisoner coming from Mr. Walker's manufactory, his pockets appeared bulky, and his coat seemed to hang heavy, I walked softly after him and hit his pocket with the back of my hands, I found it was something very heavy, I says where are you going my friend, he said he was going to the founder's he worked for Mr. Walker, he was not a yard or two from it; I laid hold of his pockets (he trembled very much), I told him he must go with me to the watchhouse; I took him there and sent for Mr. Walker, I searched him, and Mr. Walker claimed the property; he told me where he lodged, I searched his lodgings and found this basket of iron. (The property produced and identified by the prosecutor.)
It is the first offence that ever I have been guilty of of this sort; I have always endeavoured to maintain my family in an honest way before; I have served my king and county both by sea and land.
