- I am a bookseller , in Crown-court, Salisbury-court, Fleet-street ; I lost two books from my stall on Tuesday the 7th of last month, to the best of my recollection, about eleven o'clock in the forenoon; I saw the prisoner take them from the stall; I was inside the shop; he ran away with them, and I came round the corner, and pursued him; he threw the books into the kennel, and I overtook him within twenty yards after he had thrown them away; they were Travels in North America; they had my private mark on them; I brought him back, and picked up the books; the constable has them.(Richard Templeman, a constable, produced the books, which were identified by the prosecutor.)
I never saw the books.
