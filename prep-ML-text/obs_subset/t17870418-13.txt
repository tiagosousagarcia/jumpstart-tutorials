I only prove the property; I am son to the prosecutor; the goods were on Sommer's Quay ; there are sweet almonds, and bitter almonds; they are in cellons or baskets; I never saw the prisoner till now.
I was employed as watchman on Sommer's Quay to take care of Court's goods; on Thursday night, the 1st of March, I was on my duty, and I saw this prisoner and another man about eight; they were coming towards the waterside, where the goods lay; I asked them what business they had there; the prisoner said he was going down to Gravesend, on board a Greenland vessel; he went away, and shortly after I saw the same man and another come down, and sit on the bench; he said they were waiting for a Gravesend boat; I told the King's watchman of it, and about ten o'clock I saw the prisoner and the same man go into the Queen's Head; they had a pint of beer, and drank to each other; the prisoner left the house, I followed him; he pretended to be drunk, he made a fall on the basket; about one, I saw the prisoner go on board, and he put his hand and took out the almonds; I ran after him, and he let the almonds fall overboard; he took them after the Gravesend boats had failed; he was on a deck ladder close to the Quay; we could see them the next morning laying in the mud; the constable has the handkerchief, with part of the almonds; I saw him let the almonds fall; I caught the prisoner by the breast; the other man got clear off.
On the 2d of March, between one and two, the prisoner came across, and took the almonds out, and put them in his handkerchief; I asked him what he was doing; he said nothing; he took the corner of his handkerchief, and let it down, and above half of them fell over board; I snatched the handkerchief from him, he knocked me down; we took him to the watch-house.
I took charge of the prisoner, and picked up some of the almonds.
