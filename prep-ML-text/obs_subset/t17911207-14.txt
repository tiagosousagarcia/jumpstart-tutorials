I am a single woman; I lost a watch; I live at No. 7, Wardour-street, Soho ; I hung up my watch in the parlour; it was on the 9th of November; I saw it about five minutes before the prisoner came in; I keep a tallow-chandler's shop.
As I was making candles, I saw the prisoner at the bar running across the shop; I laid hold of him; he had the watch in his left-hand; he threw it into the parlour.
I went into the parlour; I saw the watch, and picked it up; Mrs. Bourne was holding him by the collar.
I had the watch a little time, and gave it to Sanders.
I had a holiday that day, and went to get change for a shilling in their shop; I knocked with my foot several times; and, coming out, this young man charged me with stealing the watch; I have several respectable witnesses to my character.
