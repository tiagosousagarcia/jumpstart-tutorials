I keep a public-house in Queen's-row, Pentonville : On Thursday, the 10th of April, my servant went to gather his pots; he brought the prisoner back with him, with the pots upon her; his name is James Harrison ; there was one quart and two pints; she had another pot which did not belong to me; I delivered them to be officer.
I am servant to Mr. Foster: I was gathering in my pots between nine and eleven o'clock; I took away from one house one quart and two pints; I put them down upon the steps of that house, and ran across the way after the newspaper to carry to another house on the same side of the way, and when I came back again the pots were gone off the step; I saw the prisoner and a little boy with her; I saw him pulling her cloak over the pots; upon that I took hold of her and secured her; she immediately let fall one quart and two pint pots; I took her and the pots across, over to my master; the prisoner and the pots were delivered to the constable.
My little boy picked them up, and brought them to me; he used to play with a pot-boy; he brought the pots, and he said they are Jem's pots; I immediately said, you little villain, how dare you touch them, and I took them out of his hand at the moment that this man came up.
Had she a child with her?
Yes; a boy of about seven years of age; he was pulling the cloak over the pots.
Did you see the pots upon the child at all?
No, I did not.
My little boy was three weeks in the House of Correction, and when he was had before the Magistrate again, the boy was discharged.
Mr. Kinnaird sent him there, to see the event of the mother's trial, that he might be sent to the Philanthropic Society.
