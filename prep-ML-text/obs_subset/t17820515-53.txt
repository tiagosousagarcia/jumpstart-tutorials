I am a carpenter . On Saturday evening, the 4th of May, between nine and ten o'clock at night, as my wife and I were sitting by the fire, I heard a noise. I went up stairs, and found the prisoner on the landing-place of the stairs, and the things mentioned in the indictment lying by her. She was shoving them into the bed-room. They had been taken out of the chest, and laid in a chair, as I was going to lend the chest to a friend. The great coat was dropped in the middle of the room. I called a lodger down stairs, and sent him for a constable, and gave him charge of her.
I laid all the cloaths in a chair in the front room, after they had been taken out of the chest, about four or five o'clock.
The prosecutor sent for me on the 4th of May, a little after nine at night, and gave me charge of the prisoner; the cloaths lay by her at the time. I carried her to the watch-house, and delivered her to the care of the beadle.
Was it light or dark when you was sent for?
Dark.
When the prisoner was brought to the watch-house, I searched her, but found nothing upon her.
I went into the house to ask for one Mrs. Jones; that gentleman came out, and asked me who I wanted. I said, Mrs. Jones; and he shoved me up stairs, and said I had robbed him.
