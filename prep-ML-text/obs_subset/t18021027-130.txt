I am a hosier , and live at Wapping ; on the 20th of October, about six in the evening, the prisoner came to my shop to buy a pair of stockings; my young man shewed him a dozen; he wanted some with a broader rib, and while our backs were turned to reach some others down, he put a pair of those stockings under his coat; I heard him do it; I counted the stockings, and found only eleven pair; I walked round the counter, got between him and the door; I told him he had got a pair of stockings under his coat; upon which he very deliberately laid them down on the counter with a great deal of unconcern; I sent for an officer, and took him into custody.
These are the stockings
I bought them of that gentleman, Mr. Driver.
Mr. Chadwick sent to me upon the prisoner's saying he had bought the stockings of me; I sold him a pair, but these are worth one shilling a pair more than those he bought of me.
