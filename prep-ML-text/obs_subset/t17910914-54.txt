I know that I lost the callico, and that it is my mark.
I am servant to Mr. More, linen-draper , Oxford-street ; on the 27th of July I was in the shop, the servant with me, Sarah Hobbs came in and told me that a person had taken a piece off the box at the door; she described the person to us, and told us which way she went; we went in pursuit, Thomas Tindal and me, of her, and overtook her; the person was the prisoner, she gave a piece of printed callico to Thomas Tindal .
I was before Birkitt in the pursuit of the prisoner, we run out together, and I overtook the prisoner first, and she gave me this It has Mr. More's mark upon it.
It has my mark upon it, it had not been in my shop above three days, I had not seen it in my shop that day, for I was out of town.
I was going by the door at the very same time, a young fellow was standing at the door, and he asked me to take the bundle for him to Oxford-road, and he told me he would pay me for my trouble; I turned up Newman-street, and his young man here followed me, and asked me for the bundle, and I gave it him, and the servant maid when I came back asked me where the young man was? I told her I did not know; she asked me if I knew him, I told her I did not.
