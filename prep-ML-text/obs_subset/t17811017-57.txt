I keep a public-house , in Great Trinity-lane . The 10th or 11th of last month, I missed a tea-kettle out of my tap-room. I had been out, and left the prisoner in the room.
The prisoner brought this kettle, about the 10th of last month, to Mr. Jones's, in Fleet-lane, to sell. He desired me to lend 4 s. on it. I lent him 4 s. He was to call again the next day; but I never saw him after.
I have nothing to say.
