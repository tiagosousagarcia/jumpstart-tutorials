I lost three pair of worsted stockings on the 25th of November, from Strutton Ground , I saw her in the shop and going out of it; I keep a hosier and haberdasher's shop ; I saw her putting something in her apron as the was coming out of the shop, and I followed her to the door and sent a child after her and brought her back; she took them herself out of her apron and said, she had taken them but distress drove her to it, and she put them on the counter.
Before she acknowledged this had you given her any reason that you would not prosecute her?
I did not say any thing to her.
Had you made use of any expression to frighten her?
I had not.
What followed after this?
I took her before the magistrate and she was committed.
They were stockings that I picked up at the door.
I know as far as this; I was coming by the door and the woman was coming out of the house, Mrs. Barrow came out after her, and gave orders for her to be stopped, for she had robbed her of three pair of stockings; she was brought back and she gave her three pair of worsted stockings, and said, that she had taken them out of distress; I saw her take the stockings out of her shop; she said, she hoped Mr. Barrow would not hurt her as she had brought them again, and that she had taken them out of distress.
This is entirely done through a little malice that passed about a month ago between the prosecutor and me; I sell fruit in Covent-garden market , and the prosecutor came and asked the price of some fruit; I said, it is to dear for Irish people, it is only fit for English people, and so she went and took an oath that I struck her. It is entirely through spite that she has brought me here; I had no money to send for any friends, or else I could have got them here to speak in my behalf, where I have lodged for five years.
