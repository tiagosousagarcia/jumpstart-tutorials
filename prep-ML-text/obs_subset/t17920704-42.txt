I am a milk-man ; I lost my own coat and waistcoat and some money, and my wife's two gowns: my wife went out early, and the young man came in and took the things; that waked me and I got out of bed, and ran after him naked; he was pursued and taken; I am sure the prisoner is the man.
I was standing at the corner of Russel-street; I saw the prisoner with the things on his arm; he ran away and I followed him; a person stopped him; he was never out of my sight.
