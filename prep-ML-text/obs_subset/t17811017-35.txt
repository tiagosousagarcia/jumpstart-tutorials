The morine stuff mentioned in the indictment was delivered by Messrs. Freeman and Grace to my man, to bring to me to dye. It never arrived at my house. The firm of the house is John Freeman , Joseph Freeman , and Thomas Grace .
I am Archibald Brice 's carman. My master sent me to Messrs. John Freeman , Joseph Freeman , and Thomas Grace . They delivered me twenty pieces of morine. I myself loaded them. When I came home, and unloaded them, there were but eighteen pieces. I know nothing how they were lost.
Where do Freeman and Grace live?
In Devonshire-square. My master lives in Rose-lane, Spitalfields.
I live in Duke-street. I saw the prisoner and another man follow the carman's cart, on the 6th of this month, between six and seven in the evening. I saw the prisoner and another man step at the cart. I had a suspicion of them, and followed them. When they had got a little way, I saw the prisoner get up into the cart, and take a piece out, and go away with it up a place called Stewart-street. I went back to our shop, and told the foreman and one of the men. I heard no more of it till Monday. Then the carman coming by, the shopman asked him if he had lost any thing. He said two pieces.
I took up the prisoner. I searched several houses that were suspected, but found none of the property. We did not search his lodgings; they were in the city: he was taken in the out-parts.
I was very ill in bed at the time. I did not expect my trial so soon this morning: my friends are not come. I know no more about it than the child unborn.
