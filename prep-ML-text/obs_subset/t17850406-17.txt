The prisoner lodged in my house one night, and the next morning about eight o'clock, I was alarmed about a man coming out with a blanket, I immediately ran after him, I saw it under his arm; I cried out stop thief, and ran as hard as ever I could; he ran across Drury-lane, and turned up a court, and dropped the blankets; I did not see him drop them: he was brought back.
I live in the same court with Shaw, and between eight and nine I was looking out of my window, and I saw the prisoner come out of the prosecutor's house, with one blanket with the corner of it hanging out of his coat; I said, Master, you had better leave that blanket behind you: I have no doubt of its being the prisoner.
The prisoner is the same man I lighted to bed the night before; the blankets were on the bed the night before; these are the same blankets.
I know nothing of the blankets; it is a house of ill same, and they let lodgings at two-pence or three-pence a night; there were four more people in the same room; I came down in the morning about nine, and left another person in the room; I am a stranger, I came from Colchester.
