I lost the things out of my room; I saw the prisoner take them out of my drawer, about nine o'clock at night, on the 5th of February; I was stooping down at the fire, I turned about, and saw him, but was very frightened, so that I could not stir or speak; when he was gone, I recovered myself, and called out thieves; I cannot swear to him.
I live in the house, and heard Wright call out thieves; upon which I run to the passage door, and saw the prisoner with the things in his arms; I caught him by the collar, and held him till assistance came.
(Produces the things.) I was constable; the prisoner and the things were brought to the watch-house, and I took charge of him.
I was going through the passage, and heard the cry of thieves; I fell over the bundle in the passage; when I was stopped, I had not the things in my hands, as is sworn to; the prosecutrix said before the Justice, she thought it was the cat pulling the things out of the drawer, and she did not see any body.
