I am a porkman ; I lost a silver tablespoon; I cannot be positive when I lost it: it was pawned with Mr. Watts the pawnbroker.
I was servant at the time to Mr. Read of Fetter-lane: I produce a silver table-spoon pledged for six shillings on the 19th of September, marked I. H. M.; I do not remember its being pledged; it was pledged in the name of Mary Batley , on the 19th of September, as appears by the duplicate.
I am a peace officer: on Saturday, the 16th of January, or thereabouts, I was sent for to Mr. Hack's; and the prisoner
his box was brought down, and searched, and this pocket book
he then said he had taken the spoon, and that it was his master's; he fell on his knees, and asked for mercy; I told him to take notice I offered him no favour.
Was this man in your service then?
Yes; I said to him, how came you to have these duplicates of silver spoons in your possession? he cried, and downed on his knees, and said it was mine.
It is the first time I ever was guilty of any thing of the kind: I hope you will take it into consideration.
I am very sorry, gentlemen, I cannot concur in your recommendation. First, he is a servant: a servant is bound to protect our property, and not pilfer it; and we are always strict with servants: but besides that, there is a second indictment against him; though that evidence was not proper to be given in this case: under these circumstances, therefore, I dare to say you do not wish to press that recommendation any farther.
