I keep an eating house in the parish of St. Catherine .
When did you lose your watch
About seven or eight weeks ago. I lost it from under my pillow.
Did the prisoner lodge in your house
He did two or three nights, he slept along with me; I let him out at six o'clock in the morning. I went to bed again, and when I got up at eight o'clock I missed the watch.
Did you see him after he left the lodgings
I never saw him till I saw him before the justice.
On the 5th of October the prisoner came to my master and offered me the watch to pledge; I lent him thirteen shilling on it.
I keep a lodging house for sailors in Worcester street, Old Gravel lane. On the 27th of October the prisoner came to my house, he said he had just come on shore; he produced a note for twenty nine pound six shillings for wages. I told him if that was the case he might stop. I went with him the next day to see his captain, he went in, and when he came out he said I am very lucky, I have seen my captain, I am to have the money to morrow; he asked me to lend him some money, I let him have a guinea and five pounds worth of cloathes. Going up Ratcliffe Highway a woman called to him, and said he had taken her in, he had borrowed money of her; I took him home, and was pulling his things off; he dropped his pocket book. I found the duplicate of the prosecutor's watch in it; and while I turned my back he whipped a watch out of my room.
I lodged in this man's house one night; I gave him a seven shilling piece to sleep with a girl in the house, he would not let the girl sleep with me; I asked him to give the money back, he would not. In the morning when I was coming out I picked up this watch on account of my money.
to prosecutor. Did you owe him any money
No, he did give a seven shilling piece, he ate and drank five and sixpence; I offered him the eighteen pence, he would not take it.
