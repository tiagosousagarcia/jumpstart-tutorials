I lost a woollen blanket: I did not know that I lost it till I saw it before the aldermen; I have had the blanket between seven and eight years; I have no doubt about the blanket.
I am a constable. On Friday, the 24th of February, I was going down Chick-lane, I met the prisoner at the bar with the things mentioned in the indictment; I stopped him; I have kept the blanket ever since.
Prisoner. Did I not tell you how I came by the property?
He said he found it; there was lead wrapped up in it.
I can only say what my brother has said.
(Deposes to the blanket.) The blanket was on his father's bed. (A quantity of lead pipe produced.) The prisoner was about one hundred yards from the prosecutor's house.
Please you my lord. I picked up the lead; and Mr. Newman took it from me, and said, if my father would give him a guinea he would settle it; my father had not a guinea; and then he said that he would prosecute me as far as the law would go.
Court to James Newman . Was he going towards home or from home?
From home, my lord.
