On the 15th of August, I apprehended the prisoner; I went to the prisoner's lodgings, and found these things.
I swear to these knives; the articles were in a drawer in the counting-house; she was a chair-woman in the house; I searched her in my dining-room, and found 6 plated spoons.
I wish to recommend her to the mercy of the Court.
