William Brook is my son, he is but eight years old. I live in Stanhope-street, Clare-market. I take in washing; I sent him home with the several things mentioned in the indictment (repeating them)
I was going along Shoe-lane I heard this boy call out stop thief! I ran and secured the prisoner, who was running with a bundle under his arm. When I laid hold of him he dropped it. The boy came up and said they were his things. The prisoner said he knew nothing of the matter. The prisoner was conveyed to Bow-street.
I am a dyer in Shoe-lane. I was standing at my own door, and heard the cry stop thief! by this little boy. I ran down lane with Preston. I saw the prisoner turn up Brooks-court. He was running with a bundle under his arm, and the boy was runing after him. Mr. Preston and I seised him and gave the constable charge of him. I saw him drop the bundle; the boy said he had robbed him of the bundle. The prisoner said he knew nothing at all of it. We took the prisoner to Mr. Lawrence's, a constable, and charged him with the prisoner. He was taken to Bow-street, and examined. I went to Bow-street.
Whether you saw me drop the bundle?
I did see him drop it.
I am a constable. Mr. Mackay and Mr. Preston brought the prisoner to me, and gave me charge of him for the stealing the bundle from this little boy . The bundle was delivered into my care. I took the prisoner and the bundle before the justice.
I know nothing of it. There was a mob of people; I stopped to see what was the matter. A man laid hold of me and said I had robbed this little boy.
