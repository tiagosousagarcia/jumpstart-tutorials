I lost a watch on a Tuesday, about a month ago; the prisoner lodged with me; he stood at the door; he went in, and I missed my watch; he ran, and I ran after him; he was brought back; I cried bitterly; I said, John, you know how I am distressed, tell me where it is, I do not want to hurt you; so he put his hand upon me, and said, Mrs. Edmonds, I will go and tell them where it is, and he took some of the people to shew them. The watch lay at the top of my drawers, and he knew it.
I took the prisoner and found the watch.
This is a malicious prosecution carried on against me by my father-in-law, in hopes to receive a property which I should receive in a short time.
