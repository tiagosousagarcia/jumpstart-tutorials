My husband is a porter , and I keep a clothes-shop, in a cellar, in Monmouth-street: On the 5th of June, two men stopped, one asked me to sell him a shirt and the prisoner snatched two as they hung up, and ran away; he was taken to the watch-house.
You did not know the prisoner before?
No.
This was at eleven o'clock at night?
Yes; I had very little opportunity of seeing him; I was down stairs, and he was at top; there are eight stairs; I saw a hand tear them away, but I cannot say who it belonged to.
I am a soldier, and was standing at my own door opposite, I heard the cry of stop thief, I turned round, and saw a man run with some linen under his arm; I followed him, and took him about one hundred yards from the door.
On Saturday evening a person called upon me and requested I would go with him to purchase a pair of stockings, which I did, and having an Indian shawl which I brought home, I took it with me, and asked the prosecutrix the value of it; he stood bargaining for the stockings till I was tired, and walked on, but not ten yards from the cellar, then I was challenged with having the shirts, but they were picked up several yards from me; several people were rushing forward at once, and that man took me; the chief part of my time has been spent in the navy.
