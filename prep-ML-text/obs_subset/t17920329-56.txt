I am a lighterman . My partner's name is John Thompson : we missed a bag of feathers out of my boat in January.
I took the feathers into the boat from the ship Providence.
I saw the prisoner go down in Mr. Thompson's lighter; he took a bag and put it under his arm; I do not know the contents; it seemed full; it was on Tuesday, January the 7th; it was the month following Christmas: he walked up the yard from Bear Quay.
I saw this man take a bag out of the luggage boat, on the 7th of February, I think.
I am innocent as the child unborn of the fact charged against me.
