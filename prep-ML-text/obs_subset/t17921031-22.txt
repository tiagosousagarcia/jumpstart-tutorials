I keep a publick house . The prisoner stole two pewter pots and two quarts of beer.
I am a servant to Mr. Davis. I remember the prisoner; he came in about nine, and ordered two pots of porter and change for half a-crown, to No. 8; I went there; and he said it was No. 4; then he said it was not there, it was No. 30; he called a man to take them, and wanted me to go back for another pot, tobacco, and pipes; I would not; he got the change out of my hand by force, and said he would not pay me or give me the half crown; I laid hold of his coat, and he came back to my masters, and delivered up the change; what became of the porter and pots afterwards, I don't know; I went back again to see about the beer and pots, and my master came with the prisoner.
I was in the house when the man came back; and he gave me the change, and I said it makes no difference if you will let me have my beer and pots: I went to No. 30, and the man and the pots were gone; I took him to the watch-house.
On the 15th of September, I was going into the cellar, and the prisoner came to the door and ordered two pots of beer to go to No. 8.
