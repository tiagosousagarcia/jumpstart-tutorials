I am a preferable watchman in the employ of his Majesty's Customs; I was on duty on the 24th of November at Wiggin's Quay ; I had the charge of this craft in which the coffee was, about seven o'clock at night; I saw the prisoner close by a bottle-hoy on the side of the craft; I saw him move the oars, and go into the craft; I did not know whether he was a ship's watchman appointed to look after the craft or not; I made enquiry, and in a few minutes I saw him go upon the bottle-hoy deck; I then went up to him, put my finger on his breast, and felt the coffee immediately; I opened his waistcoat, and found this bag between his legs full of coffee, and this handkerchief against his breast filled with coffee; (Produces them.) His hat was full of coffee; he said he had a wife and child, and begged for mercy; I called a brother-officer, and we took him before the Lord-Mayor.
I had been at work in the day, I went into a public-house in the evening, and a man told me if I would go into the craft, he had got a bag and a handkerchief with some sweepings, and he would give me something for myself, and accordingly I went and found it there; he said there was some loose, and I put it in my hat.
