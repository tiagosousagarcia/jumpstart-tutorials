I am a widow, and live at No. 28, Dartmouth-street : On the 28th of July, I lost a black silk gown, two petticoats, and three pair of stockings out of my room, about nine o'clock in the evening, from the garret.
I was standing at my window, at nine o'clock, I saw a man slide down the tiles, and go in at the window, it was not light enough to see who it was.
I am a watchman; on the 28th of July, between nine and ten o'clock at night, I heard an alarm, but found nobody; the next morning, about five o'clock, in consequence of information, I went to a public-house, where I found the prisoner in bed; I found these two petticoats and a gown upon the parapet, close to the window of the room; after I had taken him to the office, I went back and found this jacket in his bed, with the stockings in the pocket.
How far from the house that was robbed?
Seven or eight houses.
I am a Police officer, I was sent for; I was present when the jacket was found in the bed he should have slept in, he was in bed with two other soldiers.
How do you know that that is his jacket?
I have seen him in it very often.
When I was waked, these things were in the room, I don't know how they came there.
