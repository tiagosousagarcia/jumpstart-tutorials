I am a salt manufacturer , No. 180, Bishopsgate-street , in partnership with my father, George Bowley : I know nothing of the theft.
Is there no other person who has an interest in the business besides yourself and your father?
No.
I am apprentice to Messrs. Bowley, the prisoner was in the capacity of carman: On Monday, the 5th of June, he was sent to the water-side for a load of salt, about five o'clock in the afternoon, to Billinsgate-dock, I was there to take an account of what was delivered out of the vessel; having a suspicion of his honesty I followed him home, till we got to the London-tavern, he there stopped the cart, and put a lump of salt into an empty sack, he drove the cart on till he came to the Green-dragon Inn, he there took out the lump of salt and carried it up the gate-way; he then went on, and his wife went over from the other side of the way, and took it, she was with him during the whole transaction, she waited while he put it in the sack at the London-tavern; I apprehended her with it.
You had a good character with this man, I believe?
I cannot say.
How long had he lived with Mr. Bowley?
Two or three months.
It is not worth more than three or four shillings?
Not so much; it is worth very little more than from two to three shillings.
Do you know whom he had worked for before?
I cannot say.
What character had you with him?
I did not hire him; I should suppose we had a good character with him, or my father would not have hired him.
I know nothing of the robbery; I only had charge of the prisoner.
The apprentice ordered me to deliver a ton of salt in Bishopsgate-street, and this was a piece that I thought belonged to that ton; the lumps were in danger of falling over, and I took out that one lump, and was securing it in the sack; I desired my wife to take care of it while I went after the horses, as they were gone on.
