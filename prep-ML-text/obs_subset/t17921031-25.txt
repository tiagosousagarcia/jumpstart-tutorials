I live at No. 81, Berwick-street, Soho : I am a servant : I lost the things from the line in the yard, on Thursday, the 4th of October, about four o'clock in the afternoon; I saw them about that time, and missed them directly; I saw them after they called out stop thief! and I saw the prisoner running back into the yard; Hamilton, the constable, had the things.
I am an apprentice: I saw a muslin handkerchief taken by the prisoner; he unpinned it from off the line; he put it into his breeches, and made off, and the handkerchief was afterwards produced by Hamilton.
I was constable: I searched the prisoner and found no handkerchief on him; at the next area I saw it lay in a wisp; I took it up; the gown has never been found.
I know nothing of it.
