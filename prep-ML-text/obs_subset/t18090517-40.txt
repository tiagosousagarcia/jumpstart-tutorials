I am the wife of Samuel Simmons ; my husband is a sea-faring-man ; I live in Bermondsey-spa. I went into the country last summer, I was employed at needle work; the 11th of this month it was seven months ago since I left them in the prisoner's mother's house, and when I came up from the country I missed these things.
Why do you accuse the prisoner of taking them
When I came up from the country the mother told me that the prisoner had taken the things, and I found one of the gowns on the prisoners back, and the pawnbrokers have some of my things.
I am pawnbroker; I live in High-street, Mary-le-bone; I know the prisoner very well; she has been in the habit of coming to Mr. Marriott's shop in the name of Ann Cross . On the 7th of last September, a gown was pledged by a person of the name of Ann Cross , which has been claimed by the prosecutrix, I know nothing of the prisoner no more than using the shop.
I am a pawnbroker, 17, South-street, Manchester-square. On the 2nd of May, this month, the prisoner pledged this gown with me for one shilling.
The witness has been in the habit of borrowing a shilling or two of my mother she left them two gowns in the box and nothing else; she is a false swearing woman. Here is a bill that she owed my mother for her lodging.
I settled with her mother for my lodging when I went in the country; I left my things in the box, it was not locked.
