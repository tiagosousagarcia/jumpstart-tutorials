The prisoner came to lodge with me the 3d of May; I don't know any thing of the robbery; she paid her rent pretty well.
I am the wife of the prosecutor; I missed the things in the indictment about six weeks ago; she had not quitted the lodging at the time I took her up; I found some of them at the pawnbroker's; she said her husband was a watchmaker, but I never saw any husband.
I took in this sheet of the prisoner on the 14th of May; she pledged it in the name of Watson.
This is my sheet, it has my needlework in it.
I am a pawnbroker, (produces a saucepan and a flat iron) I received them of the prisoner at the bar, the saucepan in June, and the iron in July, I have lost the duplicates, they are mislaid.
These are mine.
When I took these lodgings, Mrs. Graham left these things in the room; she does not live in the house, she comes to collect her rents on a Sunday morning. Last Sunday week I left the things in the room, and when I came back the bed was gone; was I to die the next moment I know no more of the bed, bolster, nor looking-glass than you do.
