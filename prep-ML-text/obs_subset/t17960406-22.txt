I am the wife of John Brown, I keep a house in Catherine-wheel-alley, Bishopsgate-street: Last Sunday, I sent the child to church, and I sent my little boy with her; as they were coming from church, the prisoner took the frock off the child; it is a child of two years old, the boy is eight years old, he is not here; it was in the evening, I should know it again, I have two like it; I never saw the prisoner before.
I am a weaver; I was going along Bishopsgate-street last Sunday afternoon, and heard the cry of stop thief; I stopped the prisoner, and she then threw the frock from under her apron, and the other witness picked it up; I saw the child brought home about ten minutes afterwards, without a frock.
I am a waterman; I was in Bishopsgate-street, last Sunday afternoon; I heard two children crying out, stop that woman, and seeing her run, I immediately went after her, and told this young man to stop the prisoner, and she directly chucked the frock away out of her right hand from under her apron; I picked it up, and delivered it to the officer; I saw this child about two years of age with a frock off, it was this woman's child, who lives next door to the officer, Robert Rosoman.
Last Sunday, I was coming along, between three and four o'clock, it rained very hard, and I saw this woman running; I crossed over the way and saw the poor children in the middle of the road, in a pouring rain, crying; the young child had no frock on, it had a pin-a-fore on, and I took the child home to its mother.
I am a constable, (produces the frock,) I received it from Goldsborough; I have had it ever since.
This is my frock; the child I have in my arms has got the fellow to it on.(The prisoner did not make any defence).
