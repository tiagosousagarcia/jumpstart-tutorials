On the twenty second of October I lost my watch in the Park; there was a swivel seal and key to it. As I was coming down the Park the prisoner asked me where I was going? I told her I was going home; she persuaded me to go with her. I went with her from the Mall as it is called towards the gate that goes into Fludyer-street; she made a stop near Fludyer-gate ; she then had a great deal to say to me which I paid great attention to; in the mean time she took my watch out of my pocket.
Did you perceive her when she did it?
Not at that juncture of time; when she left me she made a run; as soon as I perceived her to run I put my hand to the side of my fob and missed my watch.
When was the last time before that that you knew the watch was in your pocket?
About ten minutes before.
Are you sure it was in your pocket when this woman came up to you?
Yes; I am perfectly sure of it; I pursued her when I saw her make a run, she made a flip out of the Park into Fludyer-street. I thought my watch was lost, I went home to bed. The next morning I went to the man who had mended it in Wood-street, and told him I had lost my watch; he advised me to advertise it, which I did three days and heard nothing of it. In the Christmas week I had an information where the watch was; I went to Sir John Fielding 's, and took one of his men and went to the house where I had the information and found the watch. Jealous had it and gave it to Carpmeal.
I bought a watch of the prisoner she told me she found it.
