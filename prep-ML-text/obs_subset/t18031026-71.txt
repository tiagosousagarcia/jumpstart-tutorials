- I live at No. 10. New ton-street, Holborn ; my brother and I are feather merchants and horse-hair dealers ; the prisoner worked for us: On the 27th, she being desired to leave off work, and being longer than the rest, gave me suspicion; I let her pass by to the street-door, and called her back, and told her I thought she looked very bulky; she said, she did not; I laid hold of her petticoats, and felt the horse-hair there; my partner came, and I fetched a constable, who searched her, and found the property.
I am a constable, and searched the prisoner, and found this horse-hair under her apron and round her stays.
I only took it to put into a chair-bottom, and not to sell.
