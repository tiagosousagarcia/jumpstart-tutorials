I am a wharfinger at Porter's Quay : my partner's names are, John Edward Holmes , Thomas Chapman , and John William Chapman . I can only speak to the property.
I am porter to Mr. Hall; on the 22d of December last, I was loading of wool; I saw the prisoner take wool out of the bag, and put it into his breeches, and into his waistcoat; we let him take what he wished, and then I followed him up the gateway, and told him he had got some wool; he said, no, he had none. I pulled the wool out of his breeches, and from his waistcoat; I then took the prisoner to the compting house, and our clerk sent for a constable.
I am a constable; I have got the wool, there is one pound seven ounces; I had it weighed.
