I am gate-keeper at the Tobacco Warehouses, on Tower-hill; the prisoner was a labouring cooper in those warehouses.
Is it your duty to search the men, and rub hem down, as they go away?
Yes.
What time did they go away on the 28th of November?
About three o'clock; I searched he prisoner, and in the lining of his hat I found quantity of leaf tobacco.
Is the tobacco in the warehouses all leaf tobacco?
Yes.
In an uncut state?
Yes.
When you found this tobacco upon him, what did he say?
Not a word.
How much do you think there might be?
About a pound, or a pound and a half, or somewhere thereabout; I secured the property, and he as afterwards taken up, and I gave information of it.
Do you mean to say, there is no tobacco in the warehouses but leaf tobacco?
sot that they had access to; there is some tobacco at is feized, that is kept in those warehouses, but the coopers could not get at that.
Do you mean to say that you took all that from the lining of his hat?
No; here is as much as was taken from three of them; what I took from the prisoner was less than a third of this, but I cannot separate it.
I am warehousekeeper to the tobacco warehouses belonging to the Customs.
Are you the only warehouse-keeper under the Customs?
I am.
What is the value of this?
Somewhere under a shilling.
I gave three-pence to a sailor for two handfulls of it on the Tuesday night, and as I had no pockets I put it in the crown of my hat; when I went home I forgot to take it out, and I went to work with it the next morning to the warehouse.
