I keep a public-house , the Dover-castle; Green-stairs, Rotherhithe ; the prisoner was my servant ; on the 7th of March, in the morning, about six, she was gone; I pursued her to Petty-France; she was found; I saw her in custody; and the things in the indictment, which were lost, were found upon her by Sarah Kirkman .
I was present at the finding the goods; I stopped them on the prisoner, and sent for a constable; she came to me on Monday morning, at half past seven, to ask for Elizabeth Mitchell; she was out of breath, a bundle in her hand, and a bonnet loose, and no hat or cloak on; she said the property was her own; I have kept it ever since.
