I live opposite Mr. Steele, who keeps a clothes-shop. I saw the prisoner take a child's coat off the pin, and put it under his coat, and go up Porter-street; he came back, and went through St. Martin's court; I went in and told Mr. Steele, and Mr. Steele's man ran out and took the coat from him; I am quite sure the prisoner is the man who stole it.
Going through Cranbourne-alley, I picked up this cloak, and asked the people thereabouts whose it was; I went through St. Martin's court, and these people came after me; I have been three months in gaol; I have lost all my toes in the frost.
