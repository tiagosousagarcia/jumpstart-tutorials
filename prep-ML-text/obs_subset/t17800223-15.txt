I lost a pair of shoes on the Monday after last session (I forget what day of the month it was) while I went to carry a pair of shoes into Richardson's and Goodluck's office. The soldier (the prisoner) stood over the way at the corner of Prince's-street .
You are a shoe-cleaner there?
Yes, just by the door of the office. I caught him before he had got ten yards, and said he had got my shoes.
He had the shoes in his hand?
Yes. He was running as fast as he could. I cried out stop thief! Mr. Gowin the constable stopped him and brought him back to me. He dropped the shoes before he was taken.
Did you see him drop them?
No; the other man saw him drop them, and took them up.
Did you see the shoes in his hand?
Yes.
What did he say?
He said before the Lord Mayor that he took them off the ground where my stand is.
Did you hear him confess taking them?
Yes.
I have cleaned for the gentleman they belong to two years.
Is there any mark on them?
I do not know whether there is any mark, I know the shoes, I can swear to them; I have sworn to them; they are the same shoes.
How do you know them? give the jury some reason why you know them?
I know them by the toes, and every thing; and I can shew the gentlemen whom they belonged to.
What is the gentleman's name they belong to?
Faith I forget his name though I have cleaned for him so long.
Have you cleaned for the gentleman two years and not know his name?
Faith I cannot tell his name.
Can you recollect the gentleman's name or not?
I cannot, nor I do not know whether there is any mark or not; I have heard his name but yet I cannot tell his name rightly.
As I was going along by this corner I saw these shoes lying on the ground between the kirb-stone and the wall, I took them up and walked away gently. When I came by the Royal Exchange, they cried stop thief! and on their laying hold of me the shoes dropped.
What are the shoes worth?
I must have paid seven shillings and sixpence for them.
