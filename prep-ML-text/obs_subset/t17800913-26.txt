I live in Butcher-row, Temple bar . I lost two silver table spoons, on the 4th of August, out of a drawer in the bar. I put them there about a quarter of an hour before I missed them. The prisoner came to live with me the day before; I had him from an office; he gave me a direction to go to Westminster to enquire his character, but I had not had time to go. I missed him before I missed the spoons; upon missing the spoons I went to Westminster where he had directed me, but could not find that he had lived there. I took him the Tuesday following in Westminster.
I took a spoon in pawn of the prisoner on the 4th of August. He used to bring things for his mother; I always found her to be a very honest woman till this affair happened; she lodges at a chandler's shop in Windmill-street.
I am a pawnbroker. I took in a silver table-spoon on the 4th of August of the prisoner. I have known him and his mother five or six years; he used to come to our shop very often on his mother's account; I lent him five shillings upon it.
I went out with some beer; there was another boy who said if I did not get some spoons from my master he would do me a mischief.
The prisoner was my servant twelve months; he was in my house all that time as my other servants were; I never missed any thing; his mother is a poor but very honest woman.
