I live in Northampton-street, Wood's Close, No. 55 . I do not know the prisoner at the bar, I got my property again; I can only speak to that.
I live at the next door; I heard a noise; I went to the door, Mrs. Sheldon said this woman has robbed me; and I lifted up her cloak, and there was a hat and cloak under it, the prisoner was coming out of the house; I would not let her go, and she struck me several times; there she is. There was a linen gown and a marcella petticoat I saw in the prisoner's custody in her apron; and when she beat me, I took and I doubled her hands in her cloak, and I gave her a push, and made her drop the things; she said they were her own. The goods deposed to by the prosecutrix.
Were they washed then?
No, my Lord, they have been washed since.
Did you see the things taken from her?
I saw the prisoner on the stairs, I asked her who she wanted, she said one Mrs. Wilson; I had a difficulty to pass her with the bundle, and being with child as she is, I spoke to her out of a civility, and said I hope you are not come to rob people? she said what she had was her own. And I saw a gown under her cloak.
I leave myself to your mercy, and the mercy of God. I have not an hour to go, that I know of.
