I was very much in liquor, I went home with the prisoner, I went to bed with her, and when I awaked in the morning, I saw her with her hand in my breeches pocket; there was a knife lying upon the table, and she took that up, and said, she would run it into me.
I saw none of his money, except half-a-crown that he gave me to sleep with me.
How much money had you?
Two guineas and three shillings, besides the half-crown that I gave her.
