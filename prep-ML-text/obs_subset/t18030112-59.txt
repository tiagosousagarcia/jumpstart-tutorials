Yes; I was going to rake out the fire, and the prisoner desired me not to rake it out, for he was not going to hed just yet.

Yes.
You and the last witness slept together?
Yes.
What time did you go down in the morning?
A little after eight, we went down in the kitchen together; I opened the shutters first, and then unlocked the kitchen and the area door, which I had double-locked the night before; the keys were left in the door.
Then you found the doors in the same state in which you left them?
Yes.
So that nobody inside could let themselves out?
Yes; I went into the prisoner's room for the timler-box, the door was open.
Was the tinder-box usually kept in his room?
Yes; I asked Samuel for the tiner-box, and he said, he believed it was in the drawer; it was usually kept in the table-drawer; I looked in the drawer but could not find it there; I then went in to the nursery, and got a light.
Did you return down stairs?
Yes.
How long had you been down stairs before you saw the prisoner?
Not more than three or four minutes; he came into the kitchen, and asked me what had been the matter; I said, I did not know; he seemed very much agaitated, and said, there had been thieves in the house; then he went up the kitchen stairs, saying, he was going to call his master.
Did you ever sind the tinder-box?
Yes; it was on the prisoner's pantry dresser.
What time of the day was it you found it there?
I saw it there as I was coming down stairs, with a light, from the nursery.
Have you no means of knowing whether it was that night in the table-drawer?
It was there the night before, when I made the bed.
Were you in the kitchen when your master and the prisoner came down together?
Yes.

About half past eight o'clock in the morning.
You live in Finsbury-square?
Yes.
The prisoner was your footman?
Yes.
Had you any other man servant in your house?
No other.
Had you any other maid servants, except those that I have examined?
No other.
Mrs. Jobson was, at that time, out of town?
She had been out of town for a fortnight.
Did you see the prisoner on the morning that this happened?
Yes; a little after eight in the morning.
Tell us what passed from the prisoner to you?
He came up, in great agitation, and told me the house had been robbed; he desired I would come down as soon as possible, which I told him I should do; the prisoner and I then went into the kitchen, I examined his pantry, where he keeps the plate.
Had you learned, from the prisoner before, what sort of a robbery it had been, whether it was of plate, or any thing else?
He said the plate was gone.
Did that induce you to go to the pantry?
It did, with the prisoner; I found that the edge of the door, outside of the pantry, had been scratched a little, to make it appear as if it had been broke open.
Who kept the key of the pantry-door?
He kept the key himself; I examined the door, it is a very thick door, the lock is inside, I saw no appearance of force upon the lock.
How does this scratching appear to have been done?
By a sort of a sugar chopper; I found the sugar-chopper, by which it was done, very near the pantry-door; there was no other appearance of force at all.
Did you say any thing to the prisoner upon this circumstance?
I was afraid to awake suspicion, and I told him to go up stair's and lay the cloth for my breakfast, and make himself easy; and, privately, desired one of the maids to go for a constable; I tried the key in the lock first of all, and I found it opened and shut in the usual way.
Where did you get the key from?
Out of his pocket, I desired him to give it me; I fol lowed the prisoner up stairs, and kept my eye upon him, not to lose sight of him, till the constable came.
Had you found any thing before the constable came?
I had observed the drawer in the pantry where the plate was usually kept, I found it open, and the plate was gone; the constable came, and took charge of the prisoner, and took him away to Worship-street.
Were you present when the plate was found?
I was not; I saw it afterwards at Worship-street.
What time did you go to bed that night?
Between ten and eleven o'clock; I had desired the servants to go to bed, as their mistress was from home, I should not want them any more.
The plate was committed by you to his charge?
Yes.
Were there any table-cloths presented to you?
I saw one of my table-cloths, that he had the charge of, at Worship-street, wrapped round the plate.
How long had the prisoner been in your service?
Only three weeks.
Had you a character with him?
I had a very good character with him.
Are you a patrol in Finsbury-square?
Yes.
Do you know the prisoner?
Yes.
Do you know him as a servant of Mr. Jobson?
Yes; I had seen him there several times.
Do you know the area belonging to the house in Finsbury-square?
Yes.
Did you see the prisoner that night, the 6th of January?
Yes; I saw him, between twelve and one o'clock in the morning, go across the area, as if he had been at the privy.
Did you speak to him?
Yes; I told him he would catch cold, he was partly undressed.
How much was he dressed?
He had not his coat or waistcoat on.
Did he speak to you?
He spoke very low, that I could not hear what he said; then he went in, and shut the door softly after him.
Are you quite sure with respect to his being the person?
I am positive he is the same man.
Are you quite sure he is the person. have you any doubt?
Not the least; I had seen him lock the area-gate below at nine o'clock.
Therefore you have no doubt upon earth about it?
I have not.
We know you are an officer belonging to Worship-street?
Yes.
Did you go to Mr. Jobson's house on the morning this affair was discovered?
Yes: On Friday, the 7th of January, the prisoner was brought to the office; I went to Mr. Jobson's house, I was shewn the pantry, the door, is painted chocolate, and the side of the door white; on the side of the door, by the lock, there was a little chipping on the edge.
By the chipping, did it appear to you as if the lock had been broke?
It appeared to be done to shew that.
Could it be of any use to force the door?
Certainly not; I then tried the lock, and found it perfect; I then shut the door, and there was no appearance at all of force against the door.
Where did you go afterwards?
I then went to the kitchen-door, which commands the entrance from up stairs, which has nineteen steps to the kitchen-door, and there I found this box, which recieves the lock, lying upon the steps; and the screw of that door opens inwards from the house into the kitchen.
In order to get that off, must it have been got off inside the kitchen?
It must; because I looked at teh jaumbs of the door to see if there had been any force used on the inside, and there was none.
Was there any appearance of force as if the person had come from the area throught the kitchen?
None.
Suppose any person came from the area through the kitchen towards the pantry, did it appear as if any person coming from the area had opened this door?
No, the contrary; I was then shewn another kitchen-door, which leads to the area under the stone steps; I looked at that door, and there was no violence at all, and that door lock inwards, and opens inwards into the kitchen; after viewing that, and finding no force there, I shut the door which leads into the area, and that door locked inside and opened inside, and there was no appearance of violence whatever; from there I went to a knife-place, in the area, and that door locked inside and opened inside, and there was no appearance of violence whatever; from there I went to a knife-place, in the area, underneath the pavement, at the end of that knifeplace was a privy, upon viewing this place I saw a number of bricks, and I called for a light, I looked in the dust-hole, Vickery immediately called out to me, Armstrong, I have found the plant; I looked down the privy, and at the end of the privy, under the seat, upon the side. I observed something white; I then got the kitchen tongs, and moved a brick that lay before it, and this tablecloth was produced, tied up, and when I opened it, it contained these articles of plate, and two more table-cloths, and two towels, on the soil (produces all the articles mentioned in the indictment) this chopper was produced to me in the kitchen, I compared it, and in the door I found the impression of this chopper, upon the sill of the door, where it had been chopped.
(To Soane.) Did you find this chopper?
Yes.
What did you do with it?
I hung it up again in its place, and afterwards delivered it to Mr. Armstrong.
(To Mr. Jobson.) Are these articles of plate your's?
They are.
And these table-cloths and towels?
They are.
I locked my pantry-door every night, but the lock catches; I am frequently obliged to lock it several times before I can make it lock. I went to bed that night, and did not come down any more till the next morning; but Susan came up for the tinder-box. I know nothing of any body getting into the house; I am very innocent of what I am charged with; there was no occasion for me to have broke the lock when I had the key in my pocket; there is a door at the back part of the house that is very seldom locked; there is nothing but a latch.
There is a building behind the house, but it is impossible any body can come in that way; it is only a way from one part of the house to another.
(To Green.) Had the prisoner any candle in his hand when you saw him?
No, he had not.
Was there sufficient light for you to be able to see the face of a man?
Yes, I am quite positive he is the man.
