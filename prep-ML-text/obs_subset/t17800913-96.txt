I am a soldier of the third regiment of guards. I was on duty in the Poultry on the 7th of June. There was I suppose a mob of three hundred people came up making a noise. The prisoner and two men offered to come into the Poultry. The prisoner had an iron bar in his hand. The mob desired me and the other soldiers to unfix our bayonets; we refused to do so; upon which they throwed dirt and stones at us; this might be at about a quarter after three o'clock in the morning. Charles the prisoner lifted up the iron bar to strike at me; in order to save myself I knocked him down with the but end of my firelock, and took him to the Poultry Compter. They would not receive him there; he was brought back again; then he was brought back a second time. I was exceedingly hurt. They were all very riotous; most of them were drunk. He was a little in liquor; he was very much hurt by being knocked down; I saw him in the hospital eight or nine days after. I did not see him in any other act of outrage, but striking at me.
I am a soldier. I remember this prisoner coming with the mob; they came down crying No Popery! and swore they would come into the jail; they said they would be d - d if they would not be in, and have their fellow prisoners out; I heard the prisoner say he had an iron bar in his hand. Then they threw brickbats and dirt at the soldiers. I saw him strike at Williamson with the iron bar, but we struck him on the arm and disabled him, and Williamson knocked him down; he was immediately carried to the Poultry Compter. He was damaged so much in the head that he could not possibly get away. He was carried to the hospital for fear he should die, which we supposed he would.
