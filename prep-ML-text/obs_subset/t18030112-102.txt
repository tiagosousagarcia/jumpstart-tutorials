- I am a tailor and slopseller , in Wapping High-street : On Saturday the 1st of January, I opened the shop about half past seven, and went up stairs to work about eight; I heard a violent ringing at the door-bell; I went down, and was told I was robbed; I followed the person described, and within one hundred yards of the house I caught the prisoner, and turned him round, when I saw the trowsers under his coat; I dragged them out, and the hat-cover sell down; I said, you rascal, I have got you; I took him to the watch-house, and locked him up; the things were hanging at the side of the door, rather inside. - (The trowsers and hat-cover were produced and identified.)
I was going to work, and a person passed me very fast, who dropped the trowsers, I asked him who they belonged to; he said, I might have them; I then picked them up, and walked away; upon which the prosecutor followed me, and said I had stolen them.
