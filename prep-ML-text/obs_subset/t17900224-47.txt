I live in George-street, Spitalfields, in the parish of Christ Church : some time ago I let the prisoner a lodging; she lodged at my house in January last; she was a lodger, and the other woman with her, Mary Brass , in a one pair of stairs room, paid for by the week, and ready furnished, with a bed and bedding, and an iron pot, a table, a single sheet, and a blanket; they had a bed between them, and furniture.
What did you lose?
I have lost two sheets; I cannot tell when: it is a good while past since I let these lodgings, about half a year, perhaps; they pay two shillings a week, one shilling each of them.
When did they leave it?
Last Saturday.
Did you go into it after they left it?
They sent me the key; and at night the prisoner came home drunk; and I charged the prisoner, and found the things at the pawnbroker's, Mrs. Tate's.
I keep a pawnbroker's shop in Catherine-wheel-alley, Whitechapel: the prisoner and Mrs. Brass together, pawned the sheet on Monday, January the 4th; I remember her perfectly well; she brought also one blanket for eight-pence, December the 28th, an iron pot for four-pence, the 28th of December, a bolster for four-pence, the 11th of November; the things are all in the name of Brass.
But did this woman come with Brass?
I am positive to giving her the money for the sheet.
I know this to be Mr. Skuse's property; I have lodged in his house, and am always in the rooms that he lets; the lodging was let to this woman, to work there; and she took in Mrs. Brass as her companion.
Mrs. Brass and I took the room as a two-penny lodging; though necessity I pawned the blankets for eight-pence that I owed; and could not, through necessity, raise the money to get them out.
