On the 10th of June, the prisoner brought another order, and presented to Mr Hodgson, and he called me.
The prisoner brought this order to me for some moist-sugar for Mr. James, Mr. James did not deal regularly with us; I looked at him, and knew him to be the man that had the nutmegs from us; I went over to Mr. Thwaites, and he was taken into custody.
Are you sure that is the man?
Yes.
At the time he came with this he made the same sort of story, did not be?
No.
Did not he say he was sent by those people?
He said, afterwards, that he lived with Mr. James.
But suppose you had not discovered the fraud, would you have given the property to him unless he had added that he was the servant of Mr. James?
No, I do not know that I should; Mr. James having no account at our house made me suspect it the more.
I am a grocer in St. Thomas's, Southwark.
Look at that paper; did you send it?
I did not.
Nor you do not know any thing of it?
No, not till Mr. Thwaites sent to me.
Do you know the prisoner?
Yes; I have known him between two and three years, he was servant to me about a year and a half ago.
I am a constable: The prisoner acknowledged that he wrote this note himself.
Do you think this is the prisoner's hand-writing?
I think it is.
Gentlemen, I am sure I should but insult you and the Court, by saying that there has not been an attempt to commit a fraud in this case; I will content myself with calling the witnesses to the character of the prisoner, and that, I am sure, will be the best way of appealing to the mercy of the Court.
