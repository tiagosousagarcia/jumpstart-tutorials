I am a hosier , No. 2, King-street, St. Giles's : About eleven o'clock on the 26th of June, the prisoner and another man came into my shop, and asked for some stockings; I shewed them some, and while I only turned my back, he ran away with two pair; Mr. Wilkinson brought back the stockings.
On Saturday the 26th of June, about eleven o'clock at night, I was at the bottom of King-street, I saw four men standing together, that I had a suspicion of; I went on the other side of the street, and saw two of them going into the prosecutor's shop; they had not been in above five minutes, before the prisoner ran out of the shop with two pair of stockings; I followed him; he had not got two hundred yards before I stopped him, and asked him what he had got there; he said, he had got a pair of stockings his messmate had given him; I took the stockings from him, and laid hold of him; he rescued himself from me, but I got hold of him again, and took him into a grocer's shop, where I left him in custody; I then went to Mr. Le Sage's shop, and informed him of it; he came to the grocer's shop, and knew the man and stockings; I have had them ever since.
