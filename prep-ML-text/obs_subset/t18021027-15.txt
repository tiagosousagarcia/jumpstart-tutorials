I keep the Crown and Sugar-loaf, in Fleet-street : On Monday, the 11th of October, I lost a pint pot; my boy saw her take it.
I am the wife of Joseph STAYTON: On the 11th of October, between one and two o'clock, the prisoner came in for half a pint of porter; when she went out the boy called out she has got a pot under her gown; he followed her into the street, and brought her back to the bar; she took the pot from under her gown, and put it down on the bar; I sent for a constable, and she was taken to Guildhall; I immediately missed a pint pot from the tap-room; it has my husband's name upon it.
I did not know I had it till I was brought back; I was in liquor; I have three fatherless children.
