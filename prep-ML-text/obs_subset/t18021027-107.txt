I am a l abourer ; between twelve and one o'clock at night, on the 15th of September, I met with the prisoner; I was looking for a lodging or a night-house; he said I was like himself for he was locked out; he said he was going to a house he knew, and if I would go with him he thought I should have a lodging; I went with him to Margaret Carron 's; when he got there he enquired for a pocket-boot he had left there the night before; the woman said she would charge but 6d. each; he laid down some halfpence and a handkerchief for the lodging; I put down a shilling, and told him to take the handkerchief back; we both went into a room, the servant came and asked what time we wanted to be called, he said about five, or after; I said I had no particular place to go to work, and did not want to be called; between five and six I turned about and saw the prisoner bustling about, but making as little noise as possible; I saw him put my coat on, and with both his hands pulling up the collar; he saw me turning in the bed, he opened the door and ran down stairs as fast as he could, with the things named in the indictment; I called at the house again and enquired whether any person had come after the pocket-book, they said, no; I found some papers in it relating to Somerset-house, which led to the taking of the prisoner, at the Guy's Head, St. Thomas's-street, in the Borough.
I am an officer; the prisoner and the prosecutor's wife came to our office and asked for a constable; she said she had charge of the prisoner for stealing her husband's cloaths; I said I would take him into custody; afterwards the prosecutor came forward and swore he was the man.
I met with the prisoner at the Guy's Head, in Thomas-street, Borough, and took him to Hatton-garden, he went voluntarily when I told him there was suspicion against him; I gave charge of him there.
I am servant to Mrs. Carron; the pocket-book was not left by the prisoner at our house, but by a man the night before.
Do you remember the prisoner coming there with the prosecutor?
No, I never saw the prisoner and Cavenaugh, I saw Cavenaugh and the man that left the pocket-book in pledge with me, they came and slept at our house.
