I am a labouring man, I keep a chandler's-shop in White's-yard, Whitechapel : I went out with some coals about eight o'clock, in the evening of the 6th of January; the prisoner was a lodger of mine, I left him in the kitchen, and when I came back he was not there; I missed a great coat and pair of stockings from the two pair of stairs room, belonging to John M'Ardell ; I had seen them between seven and eight in the evening, and I have never seen them since; the prisoner was taken up on Tuesday the 25th.
On the 6th of January, I lost a great coat and a pair of stockings from the two pair of stairs room; I had seen them, about twelve o'clock, I missed them about seen them the evening, (produces the stockings) ; he had them on when he was taken up; I have had them ever since; here is one of them that I mended myself.
It is the first offence I ever was guilty of.
