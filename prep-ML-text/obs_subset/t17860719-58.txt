I lost the things mentioned in the indictment from my own room, I was at home, this woman followed me into the house, No. 2, in Long-acre, I had been in Rosemary-lane, and in my way home I had called at the Blue-anchor, and this woman and two more followed me into my room, I will take my oath to her, she was the principal person, they knocked me out of my senses, they dragged me through the place down stairs, and when I cried out for mercy, they began in this way, they had seized my throat, and knocked my teeth almost out of my head, they dragged me down to the corner of the alley, a great way from my room, they took every thing I had in my lodging, to the value of 44 s. they did not leave me a halfpenny, then they ran away.
Did you know the prisoner before?
Yes; because I saw her at the Blue-anchor several times.
I deal in old clothes; and the old man does; and he bought four pair of breeches, and put the things in his bag, and six hats; I went into the Blakeney's-head, and the prisoner had two pair of nankeen breeches in her lap; she run after another woman and made her escape; I saw the strings of the breeches hang out of her apron.
What are you?
I follow dealing in old clothes, since I was not able to work.
Have you ever been here before in this Court?
Yes.
When, and upon what occasion?
I was upon a false accusation, accused with a hat I never had.
How long ago is that since?
Oh, lord, I cannot tell.
Was it one year or two, or how long?
I do not know.
The prisoner and two more came into my house, and called for a half pint of gin at the Blakeney's-head; while they were drinking this liquor, the old gentleman came in himself, and called for a quartern of gin, and change for half a guinea; while he was having his change, he told us he had been robbed, the prisoner was present, then he said it was by her, and one or two more, she said nothing about it, but went out of the house.
I know nothing about it.
