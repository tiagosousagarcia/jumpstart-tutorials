I am a publican in Leman-street, Goodman's-fields . On the 25th of September, in the afternoon, I saw the prisoner go out of my house, I missed a pint and a half-pint pot about half an hour after she was gone.
I searched the prisoner at the office; she was brought there by a Mr. Timms; I found these two pots upon her; she said she took them to raise a little money to pay her rent.
I was rather in liquor, and a boy gave me these pots.
