I am a silversmith in Addle-street, Wood-street , I believe the prisoner is a silversmith .
Who did he live with?
I cannot tell exactly. On the 27th of September he came to my house about eleven o'clock, I saw the prisoner come down the street, when he came opposite to my door he made a stop and said, there was a gentleman at his father's that wanted a pair of buckles; I knew his father very well, I did not deal with him, he said he wanted two or three pair, I looked at him I did not much like to trust him, but knowing the prisoner and his father, I came into the parlour, and let him have three pair of as large buckles as I had by me; he said he should sell one pair and bring the others back and pay for them, in an hour; this was at eleven o'clock in the morning, he did not return all day, I sent up at night to his father's to know about the buckles, he knew nothing at all about them; the man came back with that answer.
I am an apprentice to Mr. Eaton; I was in the counting-house the time the prisoner came in for the goods, there were three pair of buckles delivered to him; I went up in the evening between seven and eight o'clock to the father, the father said he knew nothing at all about them, the prisoner was not there.
I am a pawnbroker, I produce a pair of buckles.
I am a pawnbroker, I produce a pair of buckles.
I am a pawnbroker, I produce a pair of buckles.
I have seen these buckles at the pawnbroker's, I believe they are mine, I have no doubt but what they are mine, I am sure they are mine.
