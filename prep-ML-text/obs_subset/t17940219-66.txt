Did he bring your coat with him?
No, he was there in the building, and he came down to me, and the plaisterer that belonged to the job, said they saw the man go out with the coat.
When you went back to the house what did you do there?
I found him, they kept him there, they had got my coat in possession.
This is my property, I will take my oath.
Saturday morning between ten and eleven o'clock, I was coming towards Fullwood's-rents, and I saw a man that had worked in some buildings where I had been (he was a painter) says I, painter, are you out of work? says I, I am; then he said, I suppose you cannot give me any thing to drink; I said I could no, because my wife was ill be
sides; then says he, come along with me and we will have something to drink; I went with him up to Bedford-row, straight to this door, and he went up and brought me down this coat, and said to me, you go across King's-road with this, and we will have half a gallon of beer; I took the coat of him and looks about and did not see him coming, and immediately I returned with the coat, thinking then absolutely that he was playing a trick with me.
When we did lay hold of him he did say that he was brought into that error; he did not run from us.
