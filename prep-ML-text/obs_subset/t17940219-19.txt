the shop, two lads came up to the door, Bather was one of them, they were both dressed in blue, very near of a size, one of them stepped into the shop, catched up two remnants of cloth, one he dropped going out of the shop; I ran out, catched up that he dropped, and ran after him, and catched him at the Mews, with the other piece under his arm; a boy in the street said the first man has got it, and therefore I ran after him in particular, he having the goods under his coat; they both ran away together. I have got the cloth here, and my private mark is on it.
Mr. Prater sent to me to take this prisoner to the watch-house, after he was taken, and desired me to take care of this cloth, and I have kept it ever since.
I was going down Charing-Cross to my sister's, I was walking along, and there was a man ran past me, and dropped this, and I picked it up, and had it in my hand, and that gentleman came and took me, and said, that property is mine, and I delivered it to the gentleman directly.
