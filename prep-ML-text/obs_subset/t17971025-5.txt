I am the wife of Andrew Butler , a publican ; the prisoner came to live servant with me last June; she said she came from Windsor; I had not character with her; she lived with me about five months. On the 2d of October I went out in the morning, and left my husband in the house, and another servant, and a boy of the name of Hindes; I returned home about eleven at night, and went up stairs, and missed some of my things. I had seen 12l. of the Bank-notes, a 10l. and a 2l. the night before; they were kept in a club-box, it was the property of the club, but my husband had given security for it, I lost some more money out of a desk in my bed-room, which was not locked; I had seen them the day before; when I came home the prisoner was gone. I saw her again the Saturday after, at Maidenhead.
Did you say it would be better for her to confess?
I did; she gave me 13l. 2s. in cash, and a 1l. Bank-note; I do not know whether it was the same note that I lost; she had not received her wages, except about 12s.
I am a constable; I had these things of the prisoner's mother, in her presence, (produces them) . Mrs. Butler has had them since.
These things are all my property; this gown was made by a friend of mine, it has never been washed; and here is an apron and petticoat of my own mending. I have no doubt that they are all mine.
I am an officer of Bow-street; after the prisoner was brought back, these things were found sewed to her under-petticoat.
My mistress promised to forgive me if I gave up the things.
