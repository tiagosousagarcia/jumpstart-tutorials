I am clerk to Thomas Winkworth, and John Tilden , wharfingers : On Tuesday the 8th of April, we lost a cheese; I live on the wharf; I was up stairs at the time the man was detected; I was called down between twelve and one o'clock, where I saw the prisoner in custody, he said he was employed by a person to take it to Blackfriar's-bridge; after wards, he said, he was very sorry for what he had done.
I am a soldier, labourer to Mr. Winkworth: On Tuesday the 8th of April, I was standing at the gate and saw the prisoner coming across the wharf towards me, and I turned and faced him; I stopped him, he had a cheese concealed under his apron, under his right thigh; he was dressed in soldier s clothes; he belongs to the same regiment that I do.
I am agent to the cheesemongers, to see the cheeses landed: On Tuesday, the 8th of April, we landed a great many cheeses upon Mr. Winkworth's wharf; one parcel of them was one hundred and eighty cheeses, marked H. C. No. 40, they were all right landed upon the wharf; I saw the cheese that was taken from the prisoner, it was marked No. 40, H. C. it was one of that parcel; we piled them up in piles of ten high; when we came to look, there was one pile with only nine; I am positive it was a cheese that was taken from there.
I am constable, (produces the cheese;) I have had it ever since.
This is the same cheese, I marked it, besides that mark, H. C. upon it.
I was employed by a man to carry it to Blackfriar's-bridge.
