I saw the prisoner come out of this house with a trunk in his hand; I am very sure it was him; he came out of the back room, one pair of stairs; he had the trunk in his hand, and was putting it on his shoulder; he walked across the road with it; I let him go on till I went up stairs to see if any body was at home; I found nobody in that room; I ran down stairs, and ran across the road to Mr. Bearden, who kept a publick-house, and he assisted me to take the man; he had the trunk on his shoulder; this is the same trunk.
I am a headborough; I brought this trunk to the justice's; I received it from the last witness, in the shop, in Queen-street; I have kept it ever since.
I was a publican at the time of this robbery; I saw him with this trunk on his shoulder, the 5th of July, in Princes-street; I took him, and Franklin took the trunk.
He said he should prosecute me or lose the 40 l.
There is no truth in that; I said I was bound to prosecute him in the penalty of 40 l.
I only apprehended the prisoner with Theophilus Butcher .
A man offered me a pot of beer to carry it to Kingsgate-street; the man ran away; I told Franklin it was none of mine.
