I am a hatter , No. 9, Broad-street, Bloomsbury . On the 8th of December I received information that a woman had run out of my shop with a hat; I looked and missed the hat; in consequence of that I went to the public house next door but one, and behind the door of that house I found the ticket of my hat on the ground; it was marked eight shillings and sixpence.
I was at Mr. Snuters public house on the 8th of December, I saw the prisoner behind the back door, she appeared to have something under her great coat.
I am the watchhouse keeper. Mr. Spibey came and told me he had lost a hat, and from the description of the woman I knew her. I apprehended her in Broad-street, St. Giles's. In one of her hands, which was very hard clenched, I found a duplicate of a hat; I informed Mr. Spibey; we went to the pawnbroker's and the hat had just been pawned.
I am a pawnbroker. I took in a hat on the 8th of December of a woman, I cannot say who the woman is.
I never took the hat nor saw the hat.
