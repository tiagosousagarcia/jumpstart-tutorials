I keep a snuff-shop, the corner of Wild-street . The prisoner and another man came into my shop, on the 4th of October, and asked for some snuff. While they were in the shop, a person knocked at the private door. I turned my head that way. When I looked towards the prisoner again, I saw him in the act of taking the waistcoats off a chair: they had just come home from the taylor's. I went to him, and took him by the coat, and held him fast till a person came in; and I pulled them from under his coat. The other man ran away.
