I live in Shoe-lane , I am a pork butcher by business. A few minutes after five o'clock, on Saturday, the 10th instant, before I came to my own door, I observed a man standing very near my window, the next instant I see the prisoner turn out of my shop with a leg and loin of pork, which we call a quarter of pork; I immediately seized him, and called for assistance; one Francis Goodman a servant to Mr. -, a coalmerchant was passing at the time, he was nearly with him as soon as me, and see him drop the property.
Who was in your shop at the time?
I had nobody in the shop.
You went into the shop and see nobody there?
Yes, my wife came into the shop when I went in, she had heard the the noise in the street; I said to Francis Goodman, pick up the pork, and he put it into my tray, which I had in returning home from delivering the goods; at this time Francis Goodman let go the prisoner, and he gave me several violent blows to rescue himself, my face was swelled all the evening, and then I called for further assistance, and Mr. Gordon attended, the next door neighbour to me, and we brought him into our shop.
I was coming along Shoe-lane between five and six o'clock, past that gentleman's shop, and he came and seized me by the collar, three doors below his shop, immediately I asked him what he wanted with me? he said I had stole a quarter of pork out of his shop; and the pork was ten yards from me, and more than that, he told the coalmerchant's servant to say that he see me drop the pork.
