I am a salesman in Brydges-street, Covent-garden : I missed a gun, on the 19th of June, from the inside post of the door, about two o'clock in the afternoon; I had some hand-bills printed, and sent round to the pawnbrokers, and I had the gun sent home about eight o'clock the same evening; it had been pledged at Mr. Beauchamp's, in Holborn.
I am an apprentice to Mr. Beauchamp, pawnbroker, in Holborn: On the 19th of June, about two o'clock, the prisoner brought a gun to pledge, he asked four guineas, and my master lent him three upon it; in consequence of that, I asked him his name; he said his name was Crouch, No. 34, Jewry-street, Aldgate; a hand-bill was left at our house, and I carried it home to Mr. Bannister's in the evening.
Are you sure he is the man?
Yes.
I am a constable: I was sent for to Mr. Berrie's, the pawnbroker in Aldersgate-street, and Mr. Bannister and the prisoner, and the other pawnbroker, were there, and I apprehended him.
This is the gun I took home to Mr. Bannister's.
This gun is mine.
Was not there a man with me in your shop?
Yes; a man came with him, after he had pledged the gun, with a gun-bag, left the gun should take harm.
