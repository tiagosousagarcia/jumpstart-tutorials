I am a green-grocer : On the 20th of December, I lost a basket of lemons about six o'clock, and about a quarter past six, a person brought the prisoner back with a basket containing part of the lemons; they were inside the shop; I know nothing of the prisoner; there was an imitation of a farthing, which I had dropped into the basket that evening, and there was a pocket-piece in it.
I am an officer: I was going to the Office, when I met the prisoner, and four other boys, whom I knew; one of them had been convicted before; they all ran up Church-street, out of Shoreditch; I then saw the prisoner crawl into Mr. Tilley's shop upon his hands and knees; he came out again, and ran up Church-street; I thought he had only taken a few apples, and I was going to the Office, when I saw him and another boy come back, go into the shop, and take a basket of lemons; I immediately took hold of him, and carried him back with the lemons.
