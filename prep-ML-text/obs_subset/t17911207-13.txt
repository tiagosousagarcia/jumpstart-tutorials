I live at Enfield parish; I lost two linen shirts off the line, on the 24th of November; they were found on the prisoner; I did not see them taken from him.
I was coming from Enfield-highway, and I heard a woman cry Stop thief! that man has got my shirts; and I stopped the prisoner; and my mate, John Smith , came up as the prisoner gave me the shirts; I asked him for them.
I am constable; I produce the shirts; Harvey delivered them to me; he brought the prisoner with him.
I know these shirts to be my husband's; they were taken off the line wet; I did not know the prisoner before my little girl told me that a man was taking them; and I ran after him, and saw Harvey and Smith coming, and they stopped him.
I was with Harvey when the prosecutor's wife was running after the prisoner, and we pursued him and took him; he said, What do you want? I conducted him to the constable; it was not more than two minutes after the shirts were taken off the line.
I was coming from Hertford, and I was coming along; a man overtook me, and travelled about four miles with me; he wanted to borrow sixpence, and I lent him it; he said he lived at a house on the road; he went into a house; he said his sister lived there; and I walked on; and he came out, and gave the bundle to me; and this woman called Halloobulloo, we have a thief now, and I will get enough to keep me all the winter; they took my property from me; I am a stranger in this country, I came from Ireland.
Court to Mrs. Germain. Had he any bundle?
Nothing but the shirts.
Was any other man with him at the time?
No person; he had the shirts on his arm.
