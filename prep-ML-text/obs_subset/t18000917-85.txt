I am a widow, and one of the sisters in St. Bartholomew's-Hospital ; this day three weeks, I missed the sheets, the prisoner was a nurse in the hospital; I missed seven pair, there was nobody else in the ward but her and me; I have found some of them since, at the pawnbroker's.
Are you responsible for these sheets?
Yes; I must pay for them if I lose them.
I am servant to Mr. Roberts, in Long-lane, (produces three pair of sheets;) I took them in of the prisoner, I know her person; on the 3d. of August, one sheet for 3s. on the 4th of September, two sheets for 4s. on the 16th of August, two sheets for 5s. and on the 14th of July, another sheet for 3s.
I know no more than apprehending the prisoner.
These are hospital sheets, they have the hospital mark.
(To Weatherby.) Did you take in these sheets?
I took in three of them.
How came you to take in sheets with the hospital mark upon them?
They were taken in by candle-light, and she said they were her own, that she lived at No. 3, White-hart-court.
I am servant to Mr. Cotterell, No. 5, Aldersgate-Street, (produces three sheets;) they were pledged on the 14th of August, I took them in of the prisoner.
These have the hospital mark upon them.
(To Richardson.) How came you to take in these sheets?
She asked me but 4s. upon them, and therefore we did not look much at them; the marks are in the middle of the sheets, and we generally look for them at the corners; she said, they were her property.
The beadle of the hospital came to me, and told me, if I would acknowledge the articles, I should be safe, which I did, his name is Richard Payter.
Did you tell the prisoner, that if she would acknowledge the articles, she would be safe?
No, I did not; we had got some of the sheets, and I said, if she would acknowledge where the rest were, it might be better for her; I did it in order to get at the rest of the property. GUILTY .
