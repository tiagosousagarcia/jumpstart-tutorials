I am a cheesemonger . The prisoner came on the 16th of February in the evening; two boys came into my shop and told me a man had stolen a cheese; and they told me which way he was gone. I went after him, the boys went with me and shewed me the prisoner: he had the whole Cheshire cheese under his arm and had some pieces in a pocket handkerchief; and their lay a Gloucester cheese at his feet. He was standing against a door near a scuffle that there was in Rose-street. When I came up to him he dropped the Cheshire cheese and ran away; I pursued him and called for assistance. I took him to the office in Litchfield-street before Justice Welch; the boys that informed me of it took the cheese back to my shop.
What did you see?
The other boy (Jones) and I saw the prisoner go into the shop and take the cheese.
Did you know him before?
No; then I saw him go into Rose-street and sit down in a corner at a door, tying it up in a yellow silk handkerchief some bits of cheese he had taken. We informed Mr. Bonnell of it, and he went after him; we went with him; the prisoner ran away and we took the cheese back to the shop; a man came directly after that to the shop and fetched the cheese to the justice's. I put a mark upon the cheese in the office; he took the same cheese to the justice's that the prisoner had stolen.
I saw Mr. Bonnell come up to the prisoner, and I saw the prisoner drop the Cheshire cheese; the Gloucester cheese lay down at his feet.
I heard the cry of stop thief! I saw some people; I went to see what was the matter; a man knocked me down against the rails and said I was the man.
What is the worth of the cheese?
It is under valued at 15 s.
