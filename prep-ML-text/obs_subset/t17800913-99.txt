I live upon Fishstreet-hill . On the 8th of July, at about six in the morning, I went to open my street door, and found it open. I had shut the door over night; the prisoner was my servant ; I sent her for a pint of beer at night; she fetched it, and brought the keys. On finding the door open, I went up to the garret to call the prisoner; she was not there. The apprentice was in the bed, she lay in. I awoke the apprentice; all the things mentioned in the indictment were taken out of the children's room except my own clothes. I traced her to Fetter-lane, there I took her up; she confessed taking the things as soon as we went into the room, and that she had sold my clothes to a Jew. There was nothing said to her to induce her to make that confession. The other things were found in her apartment and in the next room.
I lost the thing mentioned in the indictment as my property; they were found upon the prisoner; I had seven shillings and sixpence in my pocket, and eighteen-pence in a trunk; it was all gone.
I am a constable. I was present when the things were found.
I know nothing of it.
