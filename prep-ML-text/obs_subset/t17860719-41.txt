I lost the things mentioned in the indictment the 19th of June; a little after six, and I met my woman; we both went home together, and the first thing we saw on our return was the prisoner coming out of the door of our house; she lodged in the same house; the moment she saw us she turned in her head; I ran and unlocked the door, and I missed one coat, two waistcoats, one pair of breeches, one cloak, one handkerchief and one pair of stone knee-buckles set in silver, they may be worth four or five shillings; I asked my woman what became of the things.
What your wife?
Yes, my lord, and I was going up stairs, and I saw the prisoner sitting on the stairs with something in her lap; I asked her what it was, she said, they are your things; I said, so I suspected; she said, it is so, and what of that; I took the things out of her lap down stairs, and put them in the room again; I made her go up stairs till I searched the things, then I missed the pair of buckles, and the handkerchief; she would not acknowledge the things, so I went for an officer, and kept her in custody; and I went to her to Newgate on Monday evening, and she told the she have the buckles into a horse pond where the horses drink; I went there and searched and found one of the buckles on Tuesday evening; I never found the handkerchief, she gave me no account of that; all the rest of my things I have got; they are here.
When he came to me at Newgate, he said, it I would not confess he would hang me.
My Lord, if ever such a word came out of my mouth, I wish to be made a public example of; I would not covet to hang a dog, let alone a Christian.
She is my woman.
Why you called her your wife just now?
My Lord, she is not married to me, but we live together as man and wife, and have done for many years.
I lodged in this house; the door was open of the prosecutors, and the drawers, and I took the things up for safety; I saw the landlord coming home, and I put the things in my lap, and delivered them to him, and he said, if I would not confess he would hang me, and if I would but confess, he would make a slaw in the indictment; and I hope, gentleman, as I have nobody but God and myself, that you will have mercy upon me.
