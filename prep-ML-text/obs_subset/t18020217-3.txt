I live in Stanhope-street, Clare-market , and missed a piece of printed calico on Tuesday, the 19th of January; I was undressing my window, and, looking towards the door, I saw the prisoner standing; I kept my eye on her, and soon afterwards saw her take up the piece of printed calico that lay on the counter, and go out of the door; I followed her, and found the piece of print on the payement, though I did not see her drop it; I have it in Court, and know it by the private mark, (produces it;) it is worth two pounds, six shillings, and eight pence; I took her back, and, on entering the shop, she asked for a quarter of an ounce of thread.
I was shutting up Mr. Bond's shop, and saw the prisoner come out and drop the piece of print; she was stopped directly.
I told Mr. Bond that the person who took the property went across the road; I am not guilty; I am not the person he believes, for he found no property on me.
