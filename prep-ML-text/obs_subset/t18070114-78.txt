What is your husband's name.
Samuel. I keep a shop in Little Britain.
Did you lose any cheese at any time.
Yes, on the 20th of December, about a quarter after eight, I was at the counter serving another boy, when this cheese was taken.
I work in the Tower; I was going by to work, I saw the prisoner take out the cheese from the window of Mrs. Gates' shop. I immediately took him, I asked him why he did it, he said because he was hungry.
I was hungry, and I took it.
