I keep a green-grocer's shop , at No. 14, Earl-street, Seven Dials , and, in my spare time, I make bird-cages : On the 24th of February last, I missed a cage, which was hanging at the door, and which I never saw again, till I saw it at Bow-street.
I am one of the Bow-street Patrole: On Wednesday evening, the 24th of April, as I was going up King-street, Seven Dials, I observed three boys standing in the door-way of a public house, with something in a bag, and I observed the prisoner walking away from the public-house with the bag; I crossed over, laid hold of him, and asked him what he had got there; he said he did not know; he had picked it up on the edge of the curb-stone; on examining it, I found it to be this cage (producing it) with a bird in it; I took him to Bow-street, and the prosecutor attended.
I was coming along, and I found it on the side of the pavement.
