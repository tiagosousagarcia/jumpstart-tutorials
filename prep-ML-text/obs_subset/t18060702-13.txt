I am an assistant-elder in the East India company's warehouse, Jewry-street, Aldgate ; the prisoner at the bar was a labourer employed in their service for about seven or eight years; on the 3 d of June about ten minutes past two o'clock, they all come down to be discharged, I rubbed the prisoner down to see if he had got any thing about him, I felt something in his pocket, I said what have you got here, he said nothing, taking his handkerchief out of his pocket and shaking it; I put my hand into his right hand coat pocket, I took out a handful of Hyson tea; I took him to the officer, Lawrence searched him, and took out some more Hyson tea from his right hand coat pocket, and some out of his right hand breeches pocket.
I am a custom-house officer. On the 3d of June I searched the prisoner, and in his right hand coat pocket and breeches I found a quantity of tea.
What tea is it.
Hyson tea, just the same as was in that warehouse; the prisoner before the lord mayor acknowledged that he had taken the tea out of a chest at a window on the first floor in that warehouse.
I acknowledge my fault; I maintained my character for seven years in the company's employ; I throw myself on the mercy of the court.
