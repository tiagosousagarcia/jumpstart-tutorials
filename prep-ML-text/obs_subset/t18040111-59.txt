Where do you live?
In Charles-street, Middlesex Hospital .
Are you married or single?
Single.
Do you live in a house of your own, or do you lodge there?
I lodge in the house of Mary Hopkins .
Are you sure her name is Mary?
Yes: the prisoner lived servant with me, she had only been with me two days: On the 2d of December, in the morning, she absconded between four and five o'clock; when I got up, I missed a black velvet cloak, a table-cloth, three table-spoons, two cotton gowns, a silver salt-spoon, and a shift; I have seen them since at Bow-street.
I am servant to Mr. George Lane, pawnbroker, No. 185, Holborn, (produces a cloak and two gowns;) I received them in pledge from the prisoner on the 2d of December, in the morning, about eight or nine o'clock.
I am an officer belonging to Bow-street; I apprehended the prisoner in an apartment in King-street, where I found this gown, (produces it,) and a duplicate of three silver table-spoons, three tea-spoons, and one salt-spoon, pledged with Mr. Lane, in Holborn.
The night before my mistress called me into her bed-room, and said, she was to have a gentleman to sleep with her that night; she said, she had a bill to make up in the morning, and the gentleman would not give her any more than two guineas, and desired me to pledge these things, which I did accordingly; and I went to see a fire in my way back, lost part of the money, and I was afraid to go home.
(To Spencer.) Did you give the prisoner any authority to pawn these things?
I did not; all that she says is false.
