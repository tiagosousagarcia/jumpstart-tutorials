I live at No. 2, Coleman street, Shadwell ; my husband's name is Edward Conway . On the 21st of November, about five o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner called on me; I asked her to go up stairs and make my beds; I delivered the key of the room to her; she went up and made three beds; the door was locked when she went up, and she locked it when she came down.
How long was she up stairs
About a quarter of an hour, then she came down and went home.
Had you any money up stairs
I had a box containing a ten pound note; I put it between the bed and the sacking; my marriage lines were in the box; I had seen the money the night before, and the d being made, I did not miss it till the next morning; I en looked for my box; it was gone, with the ten pound note, four duplicates and my marriage lines.
Either this good woman or her husband applied to you
The husband did. On the 24th, we saw the prisoner in the street; she took me home to her lodgings, I searched the lodgings but found nothing; I then searched her pockets, and found some silver and some halfpence. Conway told her to give him the note, he wanted nothing more of her; she positively declared she knew nothing of it: I saw the prisoner very uneasy, she wanted to put her hand into her bosom; I told Conway he had better go out of the room, I would search her; she put her hand into her left bosom; Mrs. Stevens was in the room; she pulled her hand out and put it behind her; I pushed her hand backwards to open it; in her hand I found two one pound notes twisted up in this piece of rag; I asked her what had become of the rest; she said she did not know; she was in liquor, she might have lost them.
You are sure it was a ten pound note you put in your box
Yes.
