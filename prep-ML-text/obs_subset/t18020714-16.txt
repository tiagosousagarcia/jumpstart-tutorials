I am servant to Mr. Williams, of Bedford-square: On the 30th of June, about ten o'clock in the morning, I put my watch over the chimney-piece; I saw the prisoner coming down the area, but did not suspect he was coming down to take any thing; I was coming out of the pantry into the passage, when I saw him with my watch in his hand; I immediately took him; he said, he came down to beg a drop of water; he said, he had picked up the watch from the ground; I took it out of his hand, (produces the watch;) it is mine.
I was very hungry, and I went to ask for a drop of water.
