I am a private gentleman: On Saturday the 11th of December, between three and four in the afternoon, I was going down Philpot-lane from Fenchurch-street, two men dressed like sailors came behind me, one touched me on the shoulder, and the other pulled the handkerchief out of my pocket, and immediately ran up Philpot lane; I pursued, crying stop thief; and the prisoner was stopped at the corner of Lime-street; I did not lose sight of him, except while he was crossing Fenchurch-street; the other man escaped; as soon as the prisoner was stopped, he pulled my handkerchief out of his pocket; he was immediately secured. The constable has had the handkerchief ever since. The other man ran down Philpot-lane.
I saw two sailors running in Fenchurch-street, this gentleman sung out stop thief, and I sung out stop thief; one of them dropped this handkerchief, and I picked it up.
