- I am a horse hair manufacturer , No. 119, Fleet-street : On Tuesday the 4th of November, I lost some hair; I can only speak from the information of my foreman; about a quarter after eight in the evening, when the prisoner left off work, I was sent for; the property had been taken from the prisoner, I can not swear to the hair.
- I am a horse-hair manufacturer, servant to Mr. Collins; I saw the prisoner take the hair, and put it in his hat: On Tuesday, the 4th of November, about eight o'clock in the evening, he took it from under the bed in Mr. Collins's passage; it was loose; the prisoner put it in the crown of his hat, and was going out with it on his head; I stopped him, and told him to go to the counting-house, which he did; the hair was taken from him, and given to the constable.
How much is there of it?
A pound and four ounces; it is worth ten-pence.
- I am warehouseman to Mr. Collins, in Fleet-street; the prisoner was employed as a mill-man, in milling of hair: On the 4th of November, about eight o'clock, the prisoner was going out, and he was called back by the last witness; he asked him if he had not some of his master's property; he denied it; he then took his hat from off his head, and it was full of hair; he was then desired to go into the counting-house, and I was sent for a constable.(John Foster, the constable, produced the hair).
There was none of it Mr. Collins's; I had it to mill for another person.
