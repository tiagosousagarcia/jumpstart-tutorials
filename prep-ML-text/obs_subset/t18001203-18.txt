- I am a grocer , in Wardour-street, Soho : On the 12th of November last, about seven o'clock in the evening, or a little after, I was sitting in a little parlour, I heard a cry of stop thief; I went out, and saw a man with a loaf of sugar under his arm, who said he had taken itup in the street, just below my shop, I told him it was mine; to a few minutes the prisoner was brought back, by a person who is here; I told the prisoner he must go with me to Marlborough-street; he said he would not without a warrant, or a constable; I took him by the collar, and told him he should; I took him to the office.
I am a haberdasher, in Pall-mall: I was going along Wardour-street, and saw the prisoner with a loss of sugar; I took him to be a porter when I first saw him; it was between seven and eight o'clock in the evening, the alarm was given; he put down the sugar close by me, and ran away; I ran after him, and stopped him; he gave me a little abuse, and said he did not know any thing about it; I brought him back to Mr. Giles's.
Are your sure that the prisoner is the man who dropped the sugar?
Yes.
My husband is a brass-turner, in Wardour-street, a few doors lower than Mr. Giles's, on the opposite side of the way: On the evening of the 12th of November, I saw a man come out of Mr. Giles's shop, between seven and eight o'clock in the evening, with a loss of sugar in his hands.
Did you know that man?
No; I then gave the alarm.
How came you to do that?
Because the loaf came out uncovered; I saw him put the sugar down and run away.
Are you sure that the man who came out was the same that put the sugar down?
Yes.
Was there any body in the shop?
I believe not.
(To Giles.) Was there any body in the shop?
No.
I saw several people running, and I ran with them; I know nothing of the sugar.
