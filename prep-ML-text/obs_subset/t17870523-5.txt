On Saturday, the 12th of May, I was coming up Cheapside , and just at the end of Foster lane, the prisoner picked my pocket of my cambrick handkerchief; I caught him with my handkerchief clenched in his hand, I am sure it was my handkerchief; I felt something at my pocket, and turned round, and found the prisoner with my handkerchief clasped in his hand; there happened to be a constable by at the moment, I delivered him over to the constable.
Was not there two men before me? I had been to my sister for some linen; I have people to my character.
