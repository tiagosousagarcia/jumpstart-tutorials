Henry Isaacs is my husband, we live in St. Catharine's and deal in cloaths , the prisoner had lived a servant with us about a fortnight: On Thursday was a week, I went to market about eleven o'clock, and left her in care of the house and the children; I returned in about an hour, when my little boy told me she had been up stairs and taken some things; I went up and found the things named in the indictment, and many more were gone, she left me quite naked, except what I had on; she had left this key behind her, (produces a key;) there were three muslin and three cotton gowns, which are worth more than three pounds; the next morning we found her and the things at St. Giles's; I said, Sarah. you have got all my things, how could you do so; she said, give me a knife, and I'll cut my throat, but was willing to go with us.
I belong to Lambeth street office, and took the prisoner into custody, at the top of Holborn, at the window of George Lane, a pawnbroker, where she had pawned one of the cotton gowns for then shillings; she had a gown, petticoat, stockings and shoes on her; when I told her what I wanted her for, she took me to where the things were in St. Giles's.
The bed furniture is my sons, and cost two pounds sixteen shillings.
The bed furniture is my property.
That woman keeps a bad house, and enticed me from my father and mother, and took off the things I had on, and put on others, and her husband gave me some things; every halfpenny of money I got she had, while I was there, which was three weeks.
