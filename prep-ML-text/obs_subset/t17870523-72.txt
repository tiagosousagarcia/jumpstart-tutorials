I live with Mr. David Gordon , a brass-founder , No. 46, Lime-street ; on Saturday, the 12th of May, about a quarter before eight, I had taken off the gate; there are two gates, and two wooden doors, that shut up the yard to the house; I had hung them up against the wall in the yard; about a quarter before nine, two men brought the prisoner back to Mr. Gordon's, and rung the bell, and asked me if I had not lost a gate; I looked, and said I had; then, says they, we have got the man that had the gate on his back, in St. Mary Axe; I knew the gate as soon as I saw it at Guildhall.
I am a smith; I was coming out of a gentleman's house on Saturday week, and I saw the prisoner with a gate upon his back; I told Brough, that gate is stolen, and was Mr. Whitlack's gate, but now Mr. Gordon's; Brough says, you are letting him go; I stopped him, and took the gate to Mr. Taylor's, and went to Mr. Gordon's, and asked if they had lost a gate; they said yes.
I made the gate, and repaired the latch a week before.
I assisted Brown in taking the gate from the prisoner's back, and took the prisoner to Mr. Gordon's, in Lime-street.
I was employed by a gentleman to carry the gate to St. Mary Axe, and there they took me, and carried me to the compter.
Did he say any thing to you, where he was going with the gate?
He said he was going with the gate to his master's, in Wingfield-street, to have it repaired.
