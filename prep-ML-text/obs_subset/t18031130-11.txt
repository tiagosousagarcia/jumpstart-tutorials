I live at No. 13, Little Charles-street, St. Mary-le-bonne ; the prisoner was my chair woman , about three weeks ago; I did not miss any thing till I heard she had robbed somebody else, then I missed a shirt and petticoat, and an apron.
I am an officer, and searched the prisoner, and found the duplicates of the property upon her; Mrs. Burdon went with me to the pawnbroker's, and found the thing.
I am a pawnbroker (produces the property;) I received these things in pledge, but I cannot recollect from whom; the duplicates correspond.
I have not any thing to say.
