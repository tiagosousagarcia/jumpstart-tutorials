I am a constable; On the 6th of October, I saw the prisoner, and two more, in Newgate-street, consulting together; I suspected they were about to break Mr. Waithman's windows; I watched them, when I saw one of them, not the prisoner, go into the shop and bring out two pieces of cotton; he gave it to the prisoner, and I laid hold of him; he dropped it, and ran away, I pursued him, and holloaed, stop thief; he was stopped near Green Arbour-Court; I am certain of his person, because I knew him before.
Who is in partnership with Mr. Waithman?
Mr. Brislow.
This cotton is our property, it has my private mark upon it; my partner's name is Robert Waithman.
I stopped the prisoner, he was running when I first saw him.
