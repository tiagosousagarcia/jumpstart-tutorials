I live with Mr. Mackey, a linen-draper in High Holborn , I lost my cloth on the 9th of March, about two or a little after; the prisoner came into the shop and asked for a gown; I shewed her two or three pieces; I searched for some more, and in the mean time I missed a piece of printed cotton off the counter; that was the third piece I shewed her; I went and acquainted my master, and he sent me for a constable, and the goods were found upon her.
Did she remain in the shop all the time?
Yes.
Voluntarily, or did you oblige her to stay?
My master amused her while I returned with the constable, and then the piece was found under her petticoats by the constable.
Was she in the same attitude that you left her in?
She had got away from the counter, I missed it from the counter.
I am a constable of St. Giles's, I produce the cloth; Mr. Mackey sent for me, and I went down with a young man to the shop, and the prosecutor said he suspected the prisoner had something she should not have, so I rubbed her all down backwards, and down the side of her petticoats, and I found something stick out rather behind, so I put my hand up her petticoats, and took this out from between her thighs.
I have several people for me.
We wish to recommend her to mercy on account of her age.
