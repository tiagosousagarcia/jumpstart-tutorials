I am a carpenter , I live at No. 38. Monmouth street. I was at work at Tavistock square , I lost the tools on the 10th of December, I locked them up about five in the evening, I returned to work at seven the next morning, I found the door forced open, I missed some tools, and a rope fall that I had for hoisting of timber up. I found the chisel, axe, and saw, at Mr. Hinckesman's; the rope fall was found upon him.
I am a pawnbroker, No. 30, St. Giles's.
There was some tools found in your shop, where did you get them.
Of the prisoner at the bar. On the 10th of December, towards the evening, he pledged them with me in the name of Thomas Potter ; he brought a basket of tools, containing a hand saw, a mallet, some chisels, and an axe. I gave him five shillings for them.
I found this basket of tools by Russel square; I stopped there five minutes, I took it up; not seeing any person own it I went and pawned it.
