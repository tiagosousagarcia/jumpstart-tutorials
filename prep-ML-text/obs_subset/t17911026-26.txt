I am a watchman; I took the prisoner into custody. The prosecutrix lives at No. 2, Percy-street . I took him the 24th of October, about ten minutes after nine at night, in Stevens-street; I stopped him accidentally.
I am a patrol. Last Monday night, a little after nine, I took the prisoner with the lead, the last witness was with me. The prisoner said, he found the lead by a watch-box.
I live in the prosecutrix's house. On the 24th, in the evening, I was at home; I was looking to see if the rest of the lead was gone, a part was gone before. I saw the lead on the pump next the mews the night before. The lead is fixed to the wall of the house.
I saw a man on the building between nine and ten; I do not know who the man was; it was very dark; it is in a mews.
I saw the prisoner close to the place where the lead was taken away; it was a quarter past nine; he had nothing about him.
I was the constable of the night; I detained the man, and fitted the lead the next morning; it fitted exactly; it seems to be ript off.
When you took the prisoner in Stephen-street, how near is that to Mrs. Dennis's house?
About 200 yards.
I found the lead.
