I live at No. 4, jews-row, Chelsea ; I take in washing, my husband's name is William Hicks , I lost these things on Friday week. I was not at home at the time it happened.
I saw the prisoner going out of my mother's door, with something white in her apron; I looked in the garden, and missed a sheet. I screamed out, and Mrs. Sutherland ran after her.
I lodge in the same house, between one and two o'clock, I heard Elizabeth Hicks screaming, I ran out, and took the sheet from the prisoner's lap; I secured her, and she was taken to the office.
I was in liquor at the time.
