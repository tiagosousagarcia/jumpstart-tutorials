Between one and two o'clock, on the 13th of July, I had my pocket picked in Fleet-street ; a person came up and told me my pocket had been picked; I turned round and collared the prisoner; he dropped the handkerchief; I saw him do so.
I saw the prisoner Holmes in the act of taking it out of Mr. Bailey's pocket, and I collared him.
A young man just before me dropped it.
