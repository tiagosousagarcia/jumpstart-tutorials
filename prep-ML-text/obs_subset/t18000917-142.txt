I am a coachman to Lord Desborough: On the 17th of September, about a quarter past seven in the evening, I had been to take my lord out to dinner; I came back, and backed the carriage under a gateway, and took the horses out; the prisoner went down the gateway, and took a box-coat from the box; when he saw me, he threw it down, and ran away; I took him immediately, (produces the coat) it is Lord Desborough's.
I was making water down the gateway, and this man came up, and said, I had taken the coat, I was not within twenty yards of it. GUILTY . (Aged 32.)
