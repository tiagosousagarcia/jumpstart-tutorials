I am a plumber and glazier , in Spur-street, Leicester-square ; the prisoner was my servant : On Saturday, the 5th of March, between eight and nine in the morning, in consequence of an information from a young man that lives with me, I went into a room and found some glass hid behind some lamp-black; I ordered him to mark it, and left it where it was; it was purple coloured glass; it was in a place where glass was never suffered to go; I did not miss it from that time till after the men had left their work that night; I beg pardon, it was before they had left their work; it was too late to get a search warrant; I went to the prisoner's house, and could not get admittance; the next day I went to his lodgings, and he denied it; at last, he ordered his wife to give them me; she brought down, first, two small pieces; I said, that was not what I wanted; and then he desired her to bring the two large pieces from off the bed; Mr. Thomas Parker , who was with me, marked them; it was marked by my apprentice. with a Y, in each corner of the square.
I live with Mr. Parker: On the 5th of March I marked some glass, at his request, up in the lead shop, behind a barrel of lamp-black; I marked it with my diamond, with a Y, at the corner; I had them from Mr. Parker, the next day, at his house; this is the glass that I marked, (produces it)
I was present at the prisoner's house when the glass was brought down; this is the same glass; I marked it at that time.(For the prisoner).
Except on this occasion, that you were bound to prosecute, he had a very good character?
I have known him for many years, and I never had any thing against him; and I should not have prosecuted him, but to shew my people that they must keep themselves honest.
I have known him a great many years; I had a very good opinion of him; he bore a general good character, as far as I know.
