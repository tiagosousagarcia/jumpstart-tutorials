I live in Buckingham-street, York-buildings ; I receive lodgers into my house; in the month of May, 1789, I had an account that a gentleman took my first floor, and the back parlour to sleep in, by the name of Major or Colonel Campbell; I received solicitations the next day to see him; I went down to him; he said he knew my family very well, he knew my brother at Gibraltar, and he should be very glad if there was room for a son of Lord Hopetoun's: the next day some men called for taxes; I sent word I had no money, except they could change a 25 l. Bank-note; they could not: the next day after that I received a letter; in consequence I gave the 25 l. Bank-note to Mrs. Morgan; and in about an hour after, the lodger was gone; I gave information at Bow-street, and did not hear any thing till the beginning of this month, when I received a message from Sir Sampson Wright ; I went, and there I saw the prisoner, whom I am positive is the man who lodged with me, and to whom I sent the 25 l. Banknote.
I was servant to Mrs. Adams at the time this lodger came, and I received a letter (shewn her) ; it is what I received; here is my own hand-writing upon it; in consequence I took the note to the prisoner, in the parlour, and he took his purse out, and took out some gold; then he put it up again in the purse, and said he had not enough, he must go to his banker's; he went out, and I never saw him afterwards till I saw him at Sir Sampson Wright's; I am certain the prisoner at the bar is the man.
How long was it the person you delivered the note to lived at Mrs. Adams's?
A few months.
