- I am a soldier in the first regiment of guards : On the 16th of November, between nine and ten o'clock, the prisoner and another woman called for a quartern of gin at Mr. Cope's house, where I was quartered; I went out to the door to cafe myself, and they came out at the same time; the prisoner at the bar stopped, and caught hold of my watch-chain, and said, my dear, will you go along with me; I made answer, no, I will not; she snatched the watch out of my pocket immediately, and put it into her left hand pocket; she went home immediately, and I followed her to where she lodged, in a parlour below stairs; it was not far off; I asked her for my watch.
How do you know it was her lodging?
I had been with her about six weeks before.
What is she?
A girl of the town; she would not give me the watch again; I would not go out till I had got it; she said she would not give it me, unless I would give her seven shillings; I staid there all night.
How came that?
She had locked the door.
Did you set up all night?
No, I went to bed.
With her?
Yes.
Pho!' It is too bad.
We are quite satisfied, my Lord.
