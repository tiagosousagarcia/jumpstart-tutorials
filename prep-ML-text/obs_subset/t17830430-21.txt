I am a gentleman's coachman , on Thursday last I saw the prisoner in Mr. Fozard's stables, in Park-lane , about a quarter before four in the afternoon, and I had a pair of white cotton stockings in my frock pocket, which was hanging up behind my horses, and a clean neckcloth; I went into another stable and missed a rein; the prisoner lodged at a cook's shop, in Piccadilly, and I followed and took him with the bridle in his hand an hour after; he had been a gentleman's steward, and was out of place, and was backwards and forwards in the stable all day; I asked him who the bridle belonged to, he said, he did not know; I asked him where he was going with it, he said, he did not know, I asked him to go with me, he went to the public house, and there he pulled out the reins, and my neckcloth, and a new comb and brush; I asked him if he had my stockings and handkerchief, he said, if I would go into the other room, he would deliver them to me, I would not till the constable came; when the constable came, he took them out of the backside of his breeches.
These things were given me by a man that used to be backwards and forwards at the stables in Piccadilly, his name is John, I cannot tell where he is; my friends live in Gloucestershire, I have none in town.
