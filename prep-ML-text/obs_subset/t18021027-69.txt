You are a private in the first regiment of foot Guards?
Yes, and was a sentinel on the 13th of October last on the quay of the Wet Docks , from seven to nine; the prisoner was an Excise watchman ; he came to me a little after eight, and asked me if I would come and have some wine; I said no; he said if I came to him after I came off centry, he would give me something to make some grog of; before that he asked me to let a friend of his go by, for he was in hopes of making a guinea or two that night; I said I could not do it, as it was out of my power; when I came off centry, I took a can to the prisoner on his post; I did not take the can quite to him, but put it down about nine or ten yards from him; he took it up, and went across among the puncheons of rum; he stooped down, and in a short time he brought me the rum in the same can; he gave it me, and bid me be off with it, which I did; in going out I was stopped by Dalton, the constable, and the prisoner was taken up in consequence of my information.
How long have you been in the Guards?
About two years; I was put to watch that no people should pass but on business, or with a card.
You would not let a friend of the prisoner pass?
No.
How near was the next sentry?
About one hundred yards.
You might let a man pass?
I did not.
Might a man pass if you let him?
If I would let him, but it was against orders.
The prisoner asked you to bring a bottle or can, and he would fill it?
Yes.
That not being a wrong thing you did it?
I thougth it was no harm his giving me the liquor; it was not in my charge; he chose to give it to me.
Unluckily as you were going out you were stopped?
Yes.
Where did you get the can?
From under the stairs of the guard-house; I don't know how it came there; I saw it there.
Will you swear no other person challenged you with the can before Dalton?
No other person.
How far had you run?
I did run, but cannot say how far.
Were you walking when he challenged you?
Yes.
Did you run then?
Yes, I tried to get away.
When he caught you, you thought you were in a scrape?
It was given to me.
You thought it more convenient to save yourself from punishment by accusing another?
No, how could I expect it when it was given me, tho I was in a little sear.
Did you not expect the consequence would be punsihment?
I knew I should be punished by the regiment.
Immediately you were stopped, did you point out the prisoner?
Yes.
I went on guard at the Wet Docks at nine o'clock; our orders were to let persons pass who had tickets, but no others; the prisoner was about eight or nine yards from me; I saw him pull a gimblet out of his pocket, and bore a hole in a cask, and let the liquor run into the can, and give it to Bishop, the soldier, and tell him to be off with it; a little time after Bishop was taken; there were a great number of puncheons all over the quay, and he was obliged to go among them when the alarm was made, for the constables halloa'd out, stop the man, before Bishop was taken; the prisoner went from his post to the other watchman, and got a coat; I did not hear him apply, but saw him go; it was a different coat from that he had before, which was blue; he came back in a sort of brown coat to his own station again; no conversation had passed between us; when I got back to the guardroom I informed my corporal.
You had never seen the prisoner before till he was drawing the rum into the can?
I was distant about eight yards, and saw the prisoner with the can, but don't know where he got it; it was moon-light, and nobody passed me except Bishop.
You thought it was no harm to take rum out of the casks?
There were officers over them, and I had no business with them; it was no odds to me; I saw him with the can, but had never seen the can before.
How came you not to stop Bishop?
We have no orders to stop each other.
I am an Excise watchman: On the 13th of October I was the next station to the prisoner; about half past ten I had my coat on my arm, and he asked me to lend it him; he took it off my arm, but I don't know what he did with it; I saw his own coat laying on a rum puncheon after he was taken; it was a blue one; mine was a light drab; he did not say what he wanted it for; I do not recollect that he had his coat on when he came.
I am a constable belonging to Black wall: On the 13th of October I was going on duty round the Dock, and just after I passed the wall of the Dock, I saw Bishop with a can in his hand; I asked him what he had got there; he immediately set off running; he run over the Dock gates, and I pursued him, and took him with a tin can with rum in it; I asked him where he got it; he said it was given him; I took him into custody; going along he pointed to the prisoner, and said he was the man who gave it him; in consequence I took them both; I carried Bishop to the watch-house, and Williams to my own house; I recollect he had a light drab coat on, rather short.
How far did Bishop run?
Near three hundred yards.
He said the prisoner gave it him?
Yes; he went up to the prisoner in his box, and said that is the man; the prisoner said, mind you take me off my duty.
Did you find any gimblet on him?
No.
I leave my defence to my counsel.
