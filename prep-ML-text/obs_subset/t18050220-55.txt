On the 8th of February, in the evening, I went into the White-hart public-house, Leman-street, Goodman's-fields , to drink, and put them on the taproom table, while I went into the yard; when I came back again into the tap-room, a gentleman asked me where my parcel was; they were done up in paper, I had them to alter.
Where did you find them afterwards?
In Red-lion-street, about twenty minutes after I had lost them.
Had you seen the prisoner in the public-house?
Yes, when I first came in; she came in with a pie-man, whom she called her husband, she was in the house about an hour, and I staid in there an hour and a half; when I came out of the public-house, I saw her in Red-lion-street, she was at a stand, and two watchmen with her; I saw the candlesticks in her apron, and I marked them by desire of the watchmen.
I am a constable: I was at the watch-house at the time when the prisoner was brought in.
When she came into the watch-house did you search her?
Yes; I found these six iron candlesticks in paper, and these seven shirts in her lap.
Did she give any account of them?
The woman was very drunk, I believe she did not know what she was doing.
Do you know any thing of the woman?
No; I have heard she follows selling clothes in Rosemary-lane.
I knew nothing of the candlesticks no more than of my dying-day; I really did not know that I had them.
