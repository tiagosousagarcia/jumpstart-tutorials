I am a lamplighter , I keep a house; I did not see the things taken, but they were taken from the kitchen, I saw them the night before; I stopt the prisoner, I stopt her on the middle of the kitchen stairs, and she had all the articles in the indictment about her, a copper saucepan, a tin saucepan, and an iron hammer in a basket, which she held in her hand. She asked me to go down stairs, and I took the basket from her, and kept the things that were in the basket from that time to this. (Produced and deposed to them.)
Did you find they were missing from the kitchen?
Yes.
When you met her on the stair case, was she going up or down?
She was coming up.
Did you bring these things to the justice?
I did.
You did not, you only brought a shovel and poker.
My husband calls out to me, and says, Sally, Sally, what has the woman got, do you know these things? I came and I saw her coming up stairs with the basket, and these things in it. She asked my husband to let her go down stairs; I followed her down into the kitchen, and she had a shovel and poker, putting them out of her hand, and the flat iron dropped from under her petticoats directly after. I missed every article I found upon.
I know nothing at all about it.
