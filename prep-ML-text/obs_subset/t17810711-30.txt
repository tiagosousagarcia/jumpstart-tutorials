Last Saturday night was three weeks, as I was going, between ten and eleven o'clock, for a pot of beer, to the corner of Parrot-alley, East Smithfield , I met the prisoner. He was standing, as I went up. He knocked me down at first, and called me very bad expressions.
Did you know him before?
I had seen him once before. He turned my pockets inside out, and took 4 s. 6 d. and left me bleeding. I knew who he was by an handkerchief he had round his leg.
Had he that handkerchief when he robbed you?
I cannot say.
How long were you together?
He knocked me down, immediately turned my pocket inside out, and took 4 s. 6 d. and left me in a gore of blood, and ran away.
You had no opportunity of observing him before he knocked you down?
Yes; I know that is the young man.
Had you an opportunity of observing his face?
Yes, I had; I am sure that is the man.
I apprehended the prisoner, and took two picklock keys and a cutlass from him.
I am as innocent as the child unborn. I have a witness will prove it.
I am a poor woman that goes out a charing, and sometimes a shoe-blacking. I came home from a hard day's work last Saturday was three weeks. The prosecutor's name is Eleanor Murphy , but she goes by several names; she was very much in liquor, and struck me. I returned the blow. This was between ten and eleven at night. We kept wrangling till the watchman came; and she gave charge of me, and I gave charge of her; and we were both in the watch-house till Sunday morning, the 17th. She is a woman of the town. She had a swelling on her nose, and could not smell for some time: she said the bridge of her nose was broke.
