Last Monday I was informed some person had gone up to my room, up two pair of stairs, at the Catherine-wheel, Whitechapel , and I went up stairs and missed my great coat; I went after her, and found her in Redlion-street, and she had left the coat at a pawnbroker's shop, she went to pawn it; she came out of the shop with it, and threw it upon Mrs. Mason.
I was chairing at the Catherine-wheel; there was a wedding kept there last Monday week, and the landlord said there had been somebody up stairs, and gone out to the pawnbroker's; I went to Mr. Gough's, and told them not to take it in; as I was coming out to look for somebody to assist me the coat was thrown at me but who threw it I do not know; there were nine other people in the shop, but I did not know any of them.
I saw the prisoner at the bar crossing Whitechapel, from Catherina-wheel-alley, with something under her arm, but I cannot tell what it was; the appeared to be going down Red lion-street.
The prosecutor is a lodger of mine; there was a cry of a strange woman coming down my stair-case, but I did not see who it was.
I went into Mr. Gongh's to pawn this apron, I never saw the coat, I never was before a Justice in my life before; I have four small children, one lying dead of the small-pox; here is a letter that I received from that woman, Mary Mason ; I sold my bed for a guinea for her, because she said she would not come against me; I had the best people in the Minories to come in my behalf, but they came and told me, last night, they would not come against me;
Is that your writing?
No, I never saw that paper before; I was in the prison last night, and gave her a penny, and this woman gave her a penny to get a pennyworth of beer.
