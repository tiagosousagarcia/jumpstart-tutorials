How could you know them to be yours?
I am sure of it.
But by what circumstance do you know them?
Because I saw her going out, and I went after her and took them from her.
And those that you had seen on the counter just before, you missed on her going out?
I produce the property that the prosecutrix took from the prisoner, she put me in charge till she carried her property home; there are the same things, Mrs. Smith has had them ever since, the prisoner did not deny the fact, but said her another was drove to great distress.
I have nothing to say.
