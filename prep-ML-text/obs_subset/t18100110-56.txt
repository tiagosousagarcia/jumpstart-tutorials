I am an engineer , 69, High-Holborn , the prisoner was my apprentice . I can only speak to the property.
I am foreman to Mr. Galloway, I went with Mr. Hancock, and found all these articles in the prisoner's lodgings, he resided with his mother.
I know no more than finding these things in his mother's house.
