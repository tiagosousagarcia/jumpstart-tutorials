I am foreman to the prosecutors; they are pewterer s; the prisoner was an out-door labourer ; I did not see him take the property; it was missed the 20th of January, last Friday, a little after eight in the evening; I was informed he came down directly, and went through the shop to go home; I ordered him to be called back; he denied having any metal; I told him he should be searched; he then put his hand into his pocket, and gave me a piece of metal, two pounds and eleven ounces; the value of it is about 1 s. 9 d. he said he wanted it for his wife's purpose, to hammer leather upon; she is a boot-closer; it is all one piece; it is here; I have kept it part of the time, and the constable has kept it the remainder; it is pewter plate metal.
I work journey-work for Mr. Joseph; I saw the prisoner take the metal; I believe he did not know I was in the room; I was concealed by my master's orders.
I am a constable; I produce the metal; I received it from Bredall, and marked it directly.
There is nothing in the house but what belongs to my master.
