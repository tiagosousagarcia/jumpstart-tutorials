On the 24th of September, between six and seven in the evening, I was in my shop, and heard somebody call out, Stop thief! I ran out and followed the prisoner, and found these five bedside carpets, which were dropped on the pavement; (the carpets produced) they are my property.
Is there any shop-mark on it?
No.
How do you know it is yours?
Because I know I had five bedside carpets wrapped up together, and these are them.
On the 24th of September, between six and seven in the evening, I was coming along Holborn , I saw the prisoner at the bar take some carpets from the shop, and run away; I immediately pursued him; I never lost sight of him; when he found I pursued him he dropped them.
I know nothing of the carpets further than this; there was a cart stood by the door, Mr. Harkness stood in the shop-door; how could I take his carpets?
