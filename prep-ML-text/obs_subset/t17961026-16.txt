On Monday last, in the afternoon, I lost a silk cloak out of my own room, I saw it a quarter of an hour before it was taken; I was at work in the room at the time; my wife was gone down stairs; the prisoner said, she was just going down stairs, and took the cloak away; she called upon us from Pancras, to let us know our children were well, she had been there about three quarters of an hour, I had seen her before, but had no acquaintance with her; directly as we missed it, I went to Mr. Fleming's, a pawnbroker, in Newgate-street, she was not there; and I found her at the pawnbroker's the next evening, coming to take the cloak out of pawn, and she was apprehended, and the pawnbroker produced the cloak.
I am the wife of the last witness, I have known the prisoner about five months; she was in my room last Monday, she came a little after four o'clock, my cloak was there then; I met her on the stairs with my cloak on, I did not know it was mine, when I came up I missed it; it was found the next night at Mr. Fleming's.
I am a constable; I was sent for to the pawnbroker's to take charge of the prisoner; the pawnbroker gave me the duplicate. (The pawnbroker produced the cloak, which was deposed to by the prosecutor).
I took it in of the prisoner, I am sure it is the same woman; she brought it on Monday evening a little after dark, she pledged it in the name of West; she came again next day for it, I sent then for Mrs. West.
I was very sorry I had taken the cloak, and was very willing to make it good.
