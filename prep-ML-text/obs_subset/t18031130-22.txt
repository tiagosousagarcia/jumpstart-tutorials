I am a painter and glazier , No. 22, Queen Ann-street East ; the prisoner was articled to me for three years, he lives with his father and mother; I know nothing of it myself.
I saw the prisoner go out with a pot on his shoulder; what was in it I cannot tell.
I work for Mr. Prescott; I saw the prisoner take a pot of white lead from the back shop, and go into the street; he told me he was going to convert it to his own use; he said, he had a job of his own in Castle-street; I told him he had better fetch it back again; my mistress and the prisoner had some words, but he was not taken up till next day.
Had you had any words with him?
No.
He had no job out for me that day, I had stationed him in the front shop to work.
