I live at No. 20, Rolls Buildings, I am an optician , the prisoner at the bar was in my employ nine months; I can only speak to the property.
I am a journeyman to George Norton .
Did you go with the officer to the prisoner's lodgings.
I did, last Friday fortnight, I took out the articles from his room, at Mrs. Cooper's, Baldwyn's Gardens, what I thought was my master's.
Do you know whether the prisoner lived in these lodgings at that time, or whether he had quitted them.
I do not know, I have seen him go in and out there.
You do not know whether he lived in that particular room.
I do not.
Therefore whether this was his room or another person's you do not know.
No.
I am an a police officer of Hatton Garden. On the 16th of June I went to the house of Mrs. Cooper in Baldwyn's Gardens, Owen shewed me the house, he pointed out the things from his box as the property of his master.
You do not of your own knowledge know it was his box.
No otherwise than by Owen and by the landlady; I found two duplicates, one of a telescope and one of a diamond in his box, the telescope is pledged in the name of Rushton, and the diamond is pledged in the name of Owen. (The property produced, and identified by the prosecutor.)
