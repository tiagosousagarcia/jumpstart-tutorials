I saw the prisoner come into my shop, and take the pork from the window, and give it another man on the outside. I pursued the prisoner, and I never lost sight of him, but for a moment, in the pursuit, while he turned a corner. I got sight of him again directly. I saw his heels tripped up by another person, and I directly got hold of him.
The prosecutor saw me afterwards, and did not know me again.
