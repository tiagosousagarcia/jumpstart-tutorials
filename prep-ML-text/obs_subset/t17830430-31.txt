I was a going to my customers for orders, and saw two men at Watkins's door, I stood a little way off and watched them; one with his hand upon the door, the other man took the two pair shoes, and gave them to the prisoner, and he put them in his apron.
I was just come from tea, I saw a mob in the street, and I picked up two pair of shoes, they took me, and the shoes from me; the prosecutor sent to the prison to offer to drop the prosecution if I would give a guinea.
