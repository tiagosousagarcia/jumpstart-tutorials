I am book-keeper to the Bell inn, in Warwick-lane. On Friday morning, the 6th of April, between three and four o'clock, I was unloading the waggon at the corner of Hart-street, Warwick-lane, Newgate-street : I had put fifteen flats of butter, and three flats of eggs, at the corner of the street, as I usually do; I had a flat of meat I was going to carry to one of the salesmen; the things till delivered are in my care, and I am answerable for them: as I was going round one corner of the street, I saw the prisoner come running round the other out of the market; I had some suspicion, and ran after him; I was within about ten yards of him, and saw him take a flat, the top flat; he ran away with it immediately; I ran after him, and overtook him; I caught him by the collar; upon that he dropped the flat: I saw it opened afterwards; it contained 150 eggs.
I was going to market; a man asked me to earn a groat by carrying this flat to the Mansion-house: as soon as Davis laid hold of me, the man that put it on my back ran away.
Had the waggoner any directions to send away any things in your absence?
No; I always do it.
