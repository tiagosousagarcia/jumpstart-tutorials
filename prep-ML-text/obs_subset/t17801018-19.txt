I am a victualler in Little Suffolk-street . The prisoner and her husband lodged with me six or seven months in a one-pair-of-stairs front room; there was a chest of mine in the room which was locked, I had the key of it. On the 6th of October I asked her to pay her rent? She cried and said her husband had left her. I said, as she could not pay four-shillings a week she must get a cheaper lodging; she begged I would not take away the few things she had. I said I would not; she must pay me as soon as she could. I went out and returned in about half an hour; then my wife informed me the prisoner had taken away her things and was gone. I took her afterwards at Lambeth-Marsh , and she told me where the things were pawned; she never let me know that her husband was gone till I asked her for the money.
Are you able to prove she took any of the things away after her husband was gone?
No.
I am a pawnbroker in Tooley-street. I have a silver milk-pot I took in of John Cowell, the husband of the prisoner, the 1st of July (producing it.)
I am a pawnbroker in St. Martin's-lane. I have two curtains I took in, one the 15th, the other the 31st of July; a ring on the 24th, a table-spoon on the 15th, they were all pawned by John Cowell .
When did John Cowell leave the lodging?
Six weeks before the woman left the lodging.
