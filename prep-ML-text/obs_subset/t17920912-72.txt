I lost my things from the house of Andrew Paterson; I went to bed and left my things all on the chest, and when I waked, my things were all gone. I don't know the prisoner; this was on Tuesday morning, between four and five. I took the prisoner out of the parlour chimney. When I found my clothes were gone, I got up and overhauled the house: I found him in the parlour. I lodged in the second floor; he had pulled off his clothes, and put mine on; his clothes were a good deal worse than mine.
I took the things from the prisoner's back: I am a runner at Shadwell Office; these clothes are better than the prisoner's considerably.
