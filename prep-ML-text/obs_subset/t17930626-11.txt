John Groom is a master baker , he lives in Broad-street, St. Giles's; I lost some bread myself; I was coming up Great Ormond-street, and I saw the prisoner with some loaves, and I pursued him, and he runs and turns down Lambs Conduit-street, and I catched him, and asked where he had this bread? he threw the loaves down; says I, it is all to no purpose, carry the bread to my basket, and there let me examine it; I carried the bread to my basket, and he wanted to get away before I could examine it; I found it was not my bread, I thought I knew whose it was: I went to the justice's and John Groom 's man was sent for, and the justice asked him what he had lost? he said four quartern loaves, three new and one stale, one rasped at the bottom; the justice examined the bread before he let the man see it; this was the four loaves that the prisoner threw down in the street, and then I told him to pick them up, and carry them to my basket; when he came to the basket he was going to throw them into the basket, and I would not let him; they were always kept by themselves; I had lost some out of my own basket, but these were not mine.
I am the person that lost the property; I was out with the bread, it was John Groom 's property, it was taken from the top of Drury-lane in Broad-street, St. Giles's, it was at a customer's door, while I was serving a lodger, in the mean time I lost four quartern loaves, one stale and three new ones; I saw them again at the justice's, and they were the same I lost.
The four loaves were standing in the street, and no basket nigh with them, and that man came up and made me go back with them.
