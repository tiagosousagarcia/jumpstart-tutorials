I keep a linendraper's shop , in White chapel . On Monday, the afternoon of the 13th of the present month, I was serving a customer, who informed me a woman had stolen something, and gone out of the shop with it; I ordered Richard Brown to go after the woman, and bring her back; he brought the prisoner back in one hand, and in the other a piece of printed callico, which she had stolen: there are 28 yards of it; it has my private mark upon it.
On Monday, the 13th of May, I was at Mr. Willcox's shop, buying a bit of cloth; I happened to turn myself round, and the prisoner appeared to be doing something with her petticoats; as soon as she was gone, I told Mr. Willcox I thought she had taken something, and he sent his young man out after her; I saw her brought back, and this piece of callico with her.
I am shopman to Mr. Willcox. I was sent to apprehend the prisoner; Mrs. Brookes said she had turned round the corner by our house, into Catherine-Wheel alley; I overtook her before she had got far up the alley, about three doors from the end of our premises, and I took this piece of callico from under her arm. I brought her back to the shop, and the piece of callico with her.
Are you sure it was the prisoner?
Yes.
Had you known the prisoner before, or seen her at your shop?
No.
A young man had given it to me, who had got it for his sister, who promised to give me a gown of it; I went in, to buy the body-lining; I had it open in my hand; I work for a person, who makes tents for the camps.
