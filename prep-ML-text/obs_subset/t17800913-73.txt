My pocket was picked of my handkerchief, on the 1st of August, in Fleet-street , near the Bolt and Tun. I suspected the prisoner, he was very near me; I believe he had made an attempt before. I felt something at my pocket, and I immediately missed my handkerchief; he crossed the way, and went up a court; I took him by the collar, and carried him to Bow-street, where I saw my handkerchief, and some others taken out from under his apron, by Halliburton; it has the initials of my name and a figure of 3 upon it.
Kempster brought the prisoner to Bow street. I searched him, and found this handkerchief between his shirt and his skin.
I found the handkerchief in Fleet-street, at the corner of a glass shop, by Water-lane.
