I live at Hoxton . On the 18th of October as I was laying in bed, about seven o'clock in the morning, I saw the fowl fly off the roost; in about ten minutes I heard the prisoner say that he and another lad took it; the other lad the magistrate sent to sea; the prisoner said they brought it to Newgate market, and sold it for two shillings to one that sold fowls about the street.
What is your fowl worth
I value it at what they sold it for.
What do you know of this matter
On the 28th of October I got up at seven o'clock to go to work; as I went out I saw this chicken, I saw two boys, the prisoner is one of them; one said to the other, come Sam, let us go to work; that is all I know.
On the 28th of October I went with Oxlee and apprehended this lad; he acknowledged that the other lad took it up, he was in company with him; they went to Newgate market, and sold it for two shillings.
The gentleman told me to say this or else I should be hung; Mr. Oxlee told me to say I had part of the money.
