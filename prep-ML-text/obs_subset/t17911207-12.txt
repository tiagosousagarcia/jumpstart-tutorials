I am the wife of Charles Price ; he is a carpenter : on the 17th of November we lost some cheese; it was kept in the shop; I saw the prisoner take it about half past ten in the morning; I asked him what he wanted; he stood upon the window; he took two cheeses, and ran away with them; he was taken about ten minutes afterwards; he dropped them in my sight.
I saw the prisoner, with the cheeses under his arm; I have kept them ever since.
I was coming from work; I went into the Angel to borrow a shilling; they stopt another man before they did me.
