I am the wife of George Buckley, a publican in St. John's-street-road, Clerkenwell : The prisoner at the bar came into our house in a shower of rain, and asked leave to stand up for the shower; she went into the parlour and brought out a few flowers, and asked if I would have them; I said she might leave them if she would; she desired Lydia Rhodes, my niece, to ask me to give her a drop of warm beer, which I did; as soon as she was gone, I missed a curtain, my niece went after her presently, there was a crowd about her, and somebody said she had been robbing somebody again; I looked into her basket, and there I found a pint pot of mine, covered over with some rags.
How old are you?
Going on eleven; I am the niece of Mrs. Buckley: On the 6th of this month, the prisoner was at our house, the curtain was missing, I went out after her, I told her she must come back; and she said, no, she knew what I wanted, and pulled the curtain out of her bosom; the constable has got it.
It is the first time I ever did any thing amiss in my life; I was very much in liquor.
