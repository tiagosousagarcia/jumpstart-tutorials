I am the wife of Joseph Spring; I saw the prisoner come into my shop and take the ham away, as I sat behind the counter, he took it out of the window; I called out, stop thief, and the man and the ham were brought back.
I was sent for to take charge of the prisoner.
Going along Thames-street I saw some soldiers running, and I heard somebody cry out stop thief, and I ran to see what was the matter, and there were people stopped me.
I am a serjeant in the first regiment of foot guards; I have known the prisoner these two years and better, he has behaved extremely well; I know nothing of his private character.
