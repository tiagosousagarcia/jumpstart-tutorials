I am a warehouseman at the Bull-and-Mouth Inn , kept by Messrs. Willan and Marriott: On the 16th of December, between twelve and one o'clock at noon, I came into the street, and saw the prisoner coming out of a stable of the ride, where the coach-horses go in, and Mr. Willan and Mr. Marriott's riding-horses go in; I asked him what he had got there; I saw something under his smock-frock; he said he had got nothing; then I asked him whether he worked there; he said, yes; then I followed him down the street into St. Martin's-le-grand, he turned up St. Martin's-le-grand, and then I stepped after him, and told him I thought he had got something more than he should have; I took him by the collar, and asked him what he had got; he said only a bridle; if it belonged to me I might have it; I put my hand to the bottom of the bridle, outside of his smock, and would not let him drop it till I delivered him to an officer, who took the bridle from him.
I am an officer: The last witness gave me charge of the prisoner; I took this bundle from him.
I am in partnership with Mr. Marriott, we keep the Bull-and-mouth Inn : Mr. Marriott has horses distinct from the partnership account; I think this is Mr. Marriott's bridle, I have occasionally used it myself; it does not belong to the partnership, it certainly is his bridle.
I met a man that I knew, who said he had got a bridle to sell; I told him I would get him a customer for it, and I would sell it to the best advantage; I was going by the Bull-and-mouth, and I turned in to make water, but never was within the door.
