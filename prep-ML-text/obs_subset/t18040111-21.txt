I am shopman to Richard and George Knight , ironmongers , in Foster-lane, Cheapside : On Wednesday last, about one o'clock, the prisoner came to our shop, threw a lock upon the counter, and asked me for a key; I gave him out a drawer with keys to fit a key; he looked at them sometime, and said, there were none that would do, and walked towards the fire; I ordered the boy to get him some more keys, and after the prisoner was gone, the boy informed me he had taken some parcels; I went after him, and in order to induce him to come back, I told him we had got other keys; I then laid hold of his coat, and took a parcel of files out of his pocket; I sent for a constable, and took him up stairs, when we found he had another bundle of files in his breeches; I delivered them to the constable.
I live with Mr. Knight; Mr. Bligh told me to reach the drawer of keys out, and while I was reaching the keys, I saw him take a parcel, and put it in his pocket; I gave him the drawer of keys, and went to the accompting-house to tell Mr. Richard Knight , and while I was telling him the man went out at the door; I immediately ran after him, telling Mr. Bligh he had taken something out of the shop; Mr. Bligh ran with me, and telling him we had more keys, he came back, and the files were found upon him.
I have nothing to say.
