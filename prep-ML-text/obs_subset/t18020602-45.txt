I am superintendant of the manufacturing part of the business of Mr John Robins, the elder, upholsterer , Warwick-street, Golden-square; the prisoner was in Mr. Robins's service, the prisoner went away, without assigning any reason for it, on Friday, the 28th of April, about twelve o'clock; he was taken up on the Saturday night for something else; the constable called upon me; I went to his house, and saw different articles of Mr. Robins's property.
I lodged in the same house with Ann Holloway, and the prisoner at the bar; they lived in the house as man and wife, till he was apprehended.
I have been sixteen years in London; I have been in the habit of doing jobs for myself at home, and by that means these things have been ushered in; I have always acted upon an honourable scale of life.
