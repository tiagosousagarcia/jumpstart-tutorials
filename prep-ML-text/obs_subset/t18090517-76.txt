My husband's name is Joseph Ankins , he is a plaisterer . The things were taken from No. 30, Molineaux-street, Edgware-road , I was moving to No. 25, because the house was damp.
I am a bricklayer. I was going for some coals for Mrs. Ankins, at No. 30, Molineaux-street, at nine in the evening, I saw the prisoner coming up the area with a bundle; on seeing of me he dropped it; he stood at the area door looking at me; I said my young fellow I will have you in a minute; I unlocked the door; a neighbour came up. I found the things in the area loose; I found the prisoner in the first floor back room, I took him into custody; he said pray do no hurt me; I told him it was out of my power to hurt him, the things did not belong to me. I took him to the watchhouse.
When I was taken I was innocent; I was coming along promiscuously from my work; I was intoxicated, and falling in there to lie down that evening, that gentleman came and took me. I was very much in liquor when I was taken.
