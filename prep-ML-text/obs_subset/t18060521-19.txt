I live at Hackney mills, Lea Bridge.
What is the prisoner.
A flour dresser . On Sunday morning the constable of Hackney came to me, and told me that a patrole had taken a man into custody with some flour belonging to me; the prisoner told me he took it from the mill.
How long has the man lived with you.
Between two and three years.
I am a patrole of Hackney. I stopped this man about twenty-five minutes before five in the morning, on the 18th of May, I stopped him at the bottom of Brooksby's Walk, about a mile and a quarter from the mill, I produce the property he had with him; I says to him, what have you got here my friend, he says a little dust, I says you must go along with me, he says God Almighty bless you, I will give you five shillings to let me go, I says I cannot do no such thing; I took him to the watch-house.
I belong to the trustees of the River Lea; I saw the prisoner go over Mr. Killock's premises on Sunday morning, the 18th of May, about half after three, he came back in about ten minutes, and went of the side of the mill called the mill tail.
I am a constable of Hackney. I took the prisoner into custody, he said he took it out of the mill for the use of his family, and he had been working all night; I produce the flour.
I have no doubt but that is my flour, it is like it, I cannot swear to it.
