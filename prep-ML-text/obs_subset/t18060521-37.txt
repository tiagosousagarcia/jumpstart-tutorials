I live at Teddington in Middlesex.
Who is William Eling .
He is my father, he is a farmer , they are his property. On the 16th of this month about three o'clock in the morning, as I came from Twickenham fair, I saw the man at the bar come out of my father's poultry house, I catched hold of him by the collar in my father's farm yard; I said what business have you here, he instantly chucked this bag with three hens and three ducks over the gate; I asked him what he had got there, he said he did not know, I took him back and called the servant up, while I went and got this bag; I went directly, and found this parcel over the gate.
What did that parcel contain.
Three hens and three ducks, they were all tied up, I put him in the washhouse, I produce one hen; I know this was the hen that brought up some young ducks, I heard the young ducks hallooe, which gave me the alarm, I knew them all, they were all warm.
I had been to this fair with gingerbread and nuts, I got a little drop of beer, I went into the farm yard about eleven o'clock, and about two o'clock, to the best of my knowledge, I was going to come home; a man hallooed out what have you got there, I said I only came to lay down and no harm to you; when I was coming just about five or six yards from the gates he laid hold of me by the collar, and says what did you do there over that gate, I said nothing, he took me to the house and called the men up and his father; now says he I will go and fetch a constable; the constable came about three o'clock and put me in the cage; I am innocent of that charge.
I saw him with the bag in his hand before he threw it over, I saw him throw it over, and I saw him come out of the poultry house, he had no time to go from me.
