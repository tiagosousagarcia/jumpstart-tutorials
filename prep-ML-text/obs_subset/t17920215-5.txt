I am a broker of household goods : on the 3d of February, Friday, between five and six in the evening, I saw the prisoner, I was up stairs, upon an alarm; it was then on the table; I saw it, when I went up, on the further part of the shop, along with some others; I have kept the tea-chest ever since.
I am a broker; I live within three or four doors of Mr. Wright; on the evening Mr. Wright mentioned, the man passed my door, and I saw him pass on till he had nearly passed Mr. Wright's door; he then returned, and I missed him; presently I saw him come out of Mr. Wright's shop, with something in his hand; he wrapt it in his apron; I went after him, and took him by the back part of his coat, and hauled him into Mr. Wright's shop, where Mr. Wright's brother was, and a tea-chest fell out of his apron, I think the same as now produced, but I did not mark it; Mr. Joseph Wright took it; I left it in Mr. Joseph Wright's care, and returned immediately to my own house.
I saw this drop from the prisoner; I marked it J. W. with ink.
I never had it in my hand; I was in liquor, and going by the table, and two or three fell down off the table.
I am sure it fell from his apron.
I saw him drop it.
Were there any more on the ground?
No, there were not.
