I am a carpenter , in Charles-street, Grosvenor-square: I met with a woman in Cross-lane, St. Giles's , that took me up one pair of stairs into a front room, where I saw the prisoner with a child, the woman that picked me up left me there and went away; she took me into an adjoining room, and wanted me to stay the night with her; I saw the door bolted, and there was no other person in the room but her and me, and after a little time I heard her rattling the watch-chain; I told her to be quiet, and let it alone; and a little after she jumped out of bed, and ran away out of the room; I pulled my breeches from under my pillow and the watch was gone; in coming down stairs, not being used to the stairs, I fell to the bottom, and bruised myself very much; I lost her and never saw her after, till she was taken up.
Did you ever find your watch again?
No.
Were you sober?
I was at that time; I had been drinking in the day, but I was perfectly sober at that time.
On Sunday last, between eight and nine o'clock, the prosecutor came to me, and asked me if I knew one Poll Pardon; I said, yes; he desired me to take her, and Mumford and I went after her, on Monday, and took her, he knew her directly; when she was committed, she told Mr. Bond that she would produce the woman and the watch in Court when she was tried.
I was with Treadway, and we apprehended the prisoner.
