I am a constable belonging to the Custom-house: On Wednesday the 27th of September last, between four and five o'clock in the afternoon, I saw the prisoner at the bar looking some Spanish wool out of a lighter at Galley quay ; I saw some Spanish wool in his hand; I was called away, and when I returned back, the lighter was worked out; I stopped him and found three quarters of a pound secreted partly in his hat, and partly under his apron. (produces it) : I shewed the property to Mr. Knight, and he ordered me to take him to the Compter.
Did you ever find me pilfering or skulking about?
If I must speak, I must say that he has been very guilty of pilfering on the quays.
Whose lighter was it?
Henry Salter and Henry Cooper 's; Mr. Knight and Mr. Bickham are Clothworkers Porters unshipping merchants' property.
I am a Cloth-workers' Porter, Joseph Bickham is my partner; we are Tackle Porters, and are jointly liable for any loss that may be sustained. I employed the prisoner to do part of the business; I observed there was something in his hat, I suspected he had got something there; I saw Green take the wool from him, partly out of his breeches, and partly out of his hat; it is the same kind of Spanish wool that we were at work upon.
This wool laid a little bit here, and a little bit there, I meant to bring it to the scale as I did the night before, when Mr. Green was there, and before I could get to the scale, he took hold of me, and dragged me to the Compter.
