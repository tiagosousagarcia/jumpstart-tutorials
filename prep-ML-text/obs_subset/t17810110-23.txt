I keep a house in Aldgate High Street ; I am a butcher . On the 7th of September the prisoner came to live with me as a servant ; she eloped the next day with the things mentioned in the indictment (repeating them.)
Are you sure they were in the house when she came to live with you?
Yes. On last Tuesday was fortnight I heard there was a woman taken up and was at Bow-street. I went and found the prisoner there; she generously acknowledged she had taken the things, and told where she had sold them. She said, Sir, you have children of your own; I hope you will be as merciful as you can. I said I will do all I can.
Before she told you of the things had you made her any promise of any kind?
No none. She went with me to one Mr. William Smith 's, a silversmith's in Cheapside, there we found a great table spoon; three tea spoons; and two salt spoons; and they acknowledged they had bought the mug and tea tongs, but they were sold.
Did she say she had sold them all there?
Yes. She said they gave her three guineas and a few shillings for them; they denied having bought them at all when we first went; the linen gown was found in her lodging; she told us where to go for it. Payne has the plate in his possession; he is not here.
To the prosecutor. You have no doubt the things delivered to Payne were your property?
I have no doubt.
I have nothing to say.
