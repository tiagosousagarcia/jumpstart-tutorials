I keep a linen draper's shop in the Strand : The prisoner at the bar came, to our shop, on the 3d of May, between six and seven in the evening, with her aunt, Mrs. Rackstraw; they bought a pair of stockings; the prisoner bought a half-shawl; she then requested to look at another; I observed her shuffling, as if she was endeavouring to cover something up; I refused to shew her any thing more; I looked for some muslin, which I missed; I was very much agitated, and desired the servant-maid to go to my neighbour, Mr. Trim, and desire him to walk in; Mr. Trim came in; I went through the flap of the counter, to see if it was on the ground; it was not there; I then laid hold of the prisoner, and walked her about six or seven yards down the shop, towards Mr. Trim, when she pulled the muslin out of her pocket, laid it on the counter, and said she never had it; I then went for the beadle, and she was taken into custody.
Have you no partner?
No.
The prisoner had frequently bought things at your shop?
I believe twice before.
Does any body else serve in the shop?
Yes, Isaac Thomas; he is not here.
I was sent for to Mr. Todd's; Mr. Todd charged the prisoner with having something that did not belong to her; she then pulled the muslin out of her pocket; she appeared to be under some trepidation.
I went into Mr. Todd's shop, with my aunt; I bought a pair of stockings, and asked to look at a shawl; Mr Todd then said he had lost a piece of muslin, and I had got it; I looked down, and saw it upon the ground; I picked it up and gave it to him.
