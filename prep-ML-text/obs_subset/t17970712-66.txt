I am one of the officers of the Marshalsea Court: On the 27th of June, I saw the prisoner, and several others, in Fleet-street, attempting to pick the pockets of several persons; at length, one gentleman they had followed a considerable distance, and just as he had crossed over Fetter-lane, the prisoner, covered by the others, took this handkerchief out of his pocket, he was going towards Fetter-lane, one of them was before the gentleman, and turned round in the gentleman's face, and the other two behind the prisoner; to prevent any body seeing it, he concealed it under his left arm pit; I took him before Sir William Plomer ; one of them was dressed like a servant, in a blue livery trimmed with silver lace.
The handkerchief is my own.
