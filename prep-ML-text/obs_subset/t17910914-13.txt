I live at No. 11, Chichester-rents, Chancery-lane . On the 25th of August the prisoner agreed with me for a room; he took the key, and put some things in the room; it was furnished; I lost a pair of sheets and the pillow-case; the things were missed the next morning after he took the room, and taken from him by the beadle.
I lodge in the prosecutor's house; I shewed the prisoner the lodgings, and put the sheets and pillow-case on with my own hands. The next morning the prisoner came in, and went into his room; and the prosecutor desired me to stop him if he came down with a basket in his hand. I saw the things after they were taken from him.
I am beadle of the Rolls liberty. I was coming up Chichester-rents, and Mrs. Hastings had hold of the prisoner; she desired me to call the constable. I took the bundle out of the prisoner's hand; there was a pair of sheets, wrapped up in a green baize; there was no pillow-case that I saw. I gave the property to the constable, and he gave them to the prosecutor. (The sheets produced, and deposed to.) The bundle was under his arm, and he had a basket besides.
I went up stairs into the room, and brought the sheets down for the gentlewoman to air; they were damp, and I gave them to her on the stairs.
