I live in Houndsditch , I keep a child-bed linen and stay warehouse ; I know nothing of the loss of the property.
I am the wife of the last witness; on the 1st of March, we lost the things mentioned in the indictment, they were taken out of my bed-room drawers; the prisoner was my servant, I had seen them the day before; I went out about three, I returned about seven, but did not miss the things that night; when I came home, I went up stairs, and found my drawers had been opened, I had left them locked, but I did not miss any thing that night; the prisoner was in the house; I would not suffer any of them to go out, because I had several servants; and the next morning I went to take a gown out of the drawer and found it was gone, and then I missed the other articles; I told the prisoner I was sure she had taken the things, and she strongly denied it several times; I saw my property again before the Lord-Mayor, on the 3d of March.
I am a pawn-broker, (produces a gown and coat, and a cloak) two women pledged them one night at my house, the prisoner was neither of them.
I am apprentice to Mrs. Lowdon; I know nothing of it, but that I saw the prisoner go through my mistress's shop, with a bundle in her hand; I don't know what was in that bundle, she went out alone, it was about four o'clock.
I know no further than this, the prisoner and her sister called at my house, the 1st or 2d of March, between four or five o'clock, and they had a bundle, but what was contained in that bundle I don't know.
I am a pawn-broker, I took in this gown, (producing it,) from a person of the name of Mary Smith, it was not the prisoner at the bar.
I am a constable, I was sent for to Mr. London's on the 2d of March; I took charge of his servant, I searched her box, but found nothing of Mrs. Lowdon's property there; I interrogated a great while with her, I thought she was guilty.
