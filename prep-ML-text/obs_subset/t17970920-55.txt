- On the 20th of August, about eleven o'clock in the evening, I lost three shillings and six halfpence out of my left hand waistcoat pocket; I live in Bow-street, Bloomsbury; I was going home, up Holborn , when the prisoner solicited me for a few halfpence to pay her lodging; I never saw her before; I gave her a few halfpence to pay her lodging out of my coat-pocket; then she wanted me to go home with her to bed; I told her I had got a wife at home, without going with her; I was not above ten yards from my own house; upon that she hung round me, put her hand in my waistcoat pocket, and took out the money; I told her, if she did not give it me back, I would give charge of her; she ripped out some reprobate words, and I took her to the watch-house; two of the shillings were marked; I had taken them in the afternoon; one had a large R upon it, and the other had two letters in the middle of it; they were both found upon her.
- I am watch-house-keeper: I took charge of the prisoner from Vialls, on the 20th of August; I searched her, and found two shillings upon her.
These are my shillings.
Were you quite sober?
Yes.
The prosecutor said, before I took them from her, that they were marked.
The prosecutor gave them to me among the halfpence.
The halfpence were in another pocket.
