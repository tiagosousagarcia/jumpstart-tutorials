I keep a shop in St. Martin's-court , in partnership with Hugh Lewis : On the 13th of May, we were both engaged in the shop, there were goods hanging at the door for shew; in consequence of information, I went in pursuit of the prisoner, and overtook her about fifty yards from the door, with a stuff petticoat upon her (produces it) it is our property, it has our private mark upon it.
I know nothing of it.
