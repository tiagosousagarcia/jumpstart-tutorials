On Wednesday, the 30th of November, I was at work on the key; I saw the prisoner come out of the warehouse, called Chester Key Warehouse , which we belong to; they are both under our care; I saw him come down three steps, and stopped him. I said, soldier, where have you been at work? He said, at the capstan. I saw his hand all over sugar, his breeches were full, and lined all round his body. I took seven pounds of sugar from under his clothes; it was raw sugar. I weighed the hogshead, and it wanted a quarter and seven pounds. I never lost sight of the prisoner.
I a constable to the West-India Merchants. I secured the prisoner, and kept the property ever since.
I had the misfortune to buy the sugar of a sailor on the keys.
