I am a carpenter , I live in Tabernacle-row, in the City Road ; my house was broke open on Sunday evening last, about seven o'clock; I was sitting in my back parlour; I heard a noise up stairs, and I went to the stairs and called to know if there was any body above. I saw two men pass the landing from the back-room to the fore-room; I desired them to walk down stairs, which they did; John Harris I took in the house, the other made his escape: I took him to an officer; he examined him in my presence; nothing was found upon him; almost every thing in the room was misplaced; a pair of breeches and a paper of red lead were dropped on the landing-place; they were my property.
I am a constable; I took the prisoner from the prosecutor.
That house was not inhabited lately; there was neither door nor window in it; I have slept in that room three months; I did not go into the house to take any thing away.
I have lived in the house about six weeks.
