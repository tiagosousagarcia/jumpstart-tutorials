I work at Lee bridge, I am a miller . On the 5th of November I came to town; I got in liquor, I met with this young woman, I went into a room with her, and when I came out I missed my money; I went after her and asked her for my money, she said she was not the person; I said I could not be mistaken in her person.
Was you in company with any other woman before you had picked her up
Yes.
Then she might have taken the half crown and the half guinea
No, I am sure I had it when I was with her.
On the night of the 5th of November I saw the prosecutor, he said he had been robbed of half a guinea and a half crown; he charged the prisoner with being the woman that had robbed him; I asked her for the money; there was half a guinea, half a crown, two shillings, and some halfpence, she took out of her pocket; he charged me with her; she said that if he had behaved like a gentleman to her she would not have took the money; he promised her two shillings, he only gave her one; she did not take the money from him, she found it on the bed where they were.
to prosecutor. Might not the money have dropped out on the bed
I cannot say; I was on the bed. There is SW on the half crown, it is mine.
He did not speak to the mark on the half crown till he was at the office.
On Saturday night the prosecutor had been in company with another woman; he said if she could recommend him to a Welch or Scotch woman he would pay her for her trouble; I asked him two shillings; he gave me one shilling, and two pennyworth more halfpence; as for the money I did not see it; he said he had lost some money, I said I had seen no money; he shook the quilt and the money flew on the table. I cannot say whether it was his money, as I had some company before.
