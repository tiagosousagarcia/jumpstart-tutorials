Yes.
Did he lodge and board in the house?
He did.
Was your brother in town when the till was robbed?
No, he was not.
How lately, on the 29th of September, had you seen the till?
About nine o'clock in the evening.
Was it your business to look and take care of it?
Yes.
Had you locked it up for the evening?
Yes, I had.
What property was in the till at the time you locked it up?
Seventy pounds fifteen shillings, or thereabouts; there was a twenty guinea Haverfordwest Bank-bill, a twenty pound Bank of England bill, two 5l. Bank-notes, and nine pounds in notes of one and two pounds each.
Were there any purses, containing either notes or money?
There were two purses that contained the cash, one was a brown Holland purse, and the other a canvas purse.

About half-past ten.

About seven o'clock the next morning.
When did you discover that any injury had been done to the till?
About seven o'clock, when I came into the shop.
Were you the first person that came down?
No, the servant girl.
Who was the first person that discovered the robbery?
Benjamin Bird, the other apprentice, informed me of it; we then looked for the prisoner, but could not find him.
Do you know if he went to bed in your house that night?
I saw him undress himself, and thought he was going to bed.
Did you see him again till he was apprehended at Nottingham?
No; I went to the till, and the lock appeared to have been forced, and all the money and notes gone.
The prisoner lives at Rotherhithe?
Yes.
Did you make enquiry after him?
Yes, but without success.
When was it you received any information respecting him?
Not till the bill was presented.
When was that?
I think it was on the 20th of October.
Did you go to Nottingham yourself?
No, I did not.
When did you first see him?
Last Tuesday.
Who brought him up from Nottingham?
Thomas Hutton .
Yes.
You have a share in the business, I believe?
None at all.
Nor any body else?
No, only my brother.
As to these things, it is quite impossible for you to say, whether they were taken at one time or not?
No.
What age is the boy?
About sixteen.
How long had he lived with you?
About a twelvemonth.
Are you the apprentice of Mr. Wood?
Yes.
What time did you come to the house on the morning the till was discovered to be robbed?
Nearly seven o'clock.
Did you go into the shop immediately?
I did.
Did you discover any thing amiss?
Not the first time I went in, I discovered it almost immediately afterwards; I went to call the prisoner, but could not find him.
He ought to have been up at that time?
Yes; I then called the servant-maid, and gave an alarm.
In what state did you find the till?
The drawer was drawn out at full length, and the bolt forced up.
You did not see him again till he was taken into custody?
No.
How many persons are there in this house employed by Mr. Wood, journeymen and altogether?
At that time, I believe, there were two journeymen and myself.
Had you gone away the preceding night before the journeymen?
I think I was the last.
You will not undertake to swear that?
No.
Are the journeymen here?
No.
Did you see any thing of this till before Bird?
No; I went to the shop, and saw the boy was not there, and Bird knocked at the door the same moment.
I am a Sheriff's-officer, at Nottingham.
In consequence of any information you received, did you take the young man at the bar into custody?
I did.
Do you know what part of Nottingham he resided in?
No particular place I believe; when I found him, I told him he was a prisoner; that I had directions to take him up for robbing his master; he said he had robbed his master, and he was very sorry for it.
Had you made him any promise?
None at all.
Was that the immediate answer?
Nearly to; I asked him the amount, and he said between 60 and 70l. I took him into custody, and at the desire of the Magistrate, I brought him up to London.
What did you find upon him?
A watch, two or three little trinkets, and a canvas bag.
Have you the canvas bag here?
Yes
Did you ask him any question respecting the watch and trinkets?
Yes; I asked him where he bought the watch; he said he bought it of a person of the name of Hall, at Nottingham; I asked him how he paid for it, and he said by a 20l. Bank-bill; I asked him what time it was that he went away, and he said between three and four in the morning; that he walked on, and the Briton coach overtook him, and brought him to Nottingham.
This young boy was perfectly contrite, and ready to tell you every thing?
Yes.
I believe he cried?
Yes, he did, and said, he was very sorry for what he had done.
Is that such a bag as your money was contained in?
Yes, it is such a one.
That bag is not worth a great deal?
No.
