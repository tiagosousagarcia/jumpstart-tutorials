I am a waggoner , I am answerable for any thing that is lost from my waggon: As I was coming down Holborn, about a quarter after four in the morning of Thursday the 3d of May, a gentleman told me I had lost a basket, I immediately missed the basket; I turned my head and saw a man with the basket, I laid down my whip, and asked a man to stay with the team; I lost sight of the man by his turning a corner, he turned up Southampton-street, and slung the basket down at the corner; I picked it up and gave it to a man, and pursued, and a watchman caught him in Southampton-street, I had given an alarm; I can swear to the basket, but I cannot positively swear to the man, because he was at a distance before I saw him.
What sort of light was it?
uite daylight; we took the basket in the waggon to Newgate-market, and there the rabbits were sold, and the watchman has had the care of the basket ever since.
I am a watchman: After I had called four o'clock, turning out of Holborn into King's gate-street, Bloomsbury, I heard an alarm; I saw the prisoner come out of Holborn with a basket in his arms, I am sure the prisoner is the man, then he pitched it down; two men stood in Holborn, one of them, with a handkerchief in his hand, called out and said, it was all safe, and then he took up the basket and put it on his shoulder; I sprung my rattle, and followed him; he then pitched the basket by Southampton-street, and he was stopped by another watchman, who is here; I took him to the watch-house, the waggoner went with us.
I am a watchman: A little after four in the morning of Thursday the 31st of May, I heard the rattles spring, and a cry of stop thief; I looked down the street, and saw the prisoner with a basket upon his shoulder, then I saw him throw it down, I kept my eye upon him; there was another man with the prisoner, and they were both running together; I took the prisoner by the collar, and took him to the watch-house; the waggoner said it was his basket, and that there were a dozen and a half of rabbits in it.(Lyons produced the basket, which was deposed to by Power).
It being holiday-time I had been at Wandsworth-fair, and being rather in liquor I staid later than ordinary; I met a man in Holborn with a hamper upon his shoulder, I heard the cry of stop thief, the man threw down the hamper, and the watchman immediately laid hold of me, and said I was the man; I did not make any resistance.
Are you perfectly sure this is the man that had the basket?
I am perfectly sure he is the man.
