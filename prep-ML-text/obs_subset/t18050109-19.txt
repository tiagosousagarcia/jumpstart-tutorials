- I am a china and glass man , I live at No. 22, Barbican ; the prisoner was porter in the house; this morning, as he was going to breakfast, I followed him into the street; I asked him where he was going; he said, he was going to breakfast; I said to him, what have you got in your pocket; he said, not any thing; I said, I insist upon searching you; putting my hand in his pocket, I perceived a cup uppermost in one pocket, and two cruets in the other pocket, and a gilt cruet-stand concealed partly in his small clothes under his apron; I left him with my brother while I went in pursuit of an officer; on my return, he was in custody of an officer; there were various other articles found in his apartment, I have no doubt of their being my brother's and my property, but I will not swear to them.
I am a City officer; between the hours of nine and ten, I perceived a number of people in Barbican, I went up and enquired what was the matter; I saw Thomas Burn have hold of the prisoner at the bar; I went in, and he gave charge of him to me; on searching him, I took a cruet out of one pocket, and the other out of the other.
Where was the cruet-stand?
I took that out of his breeches from under his apron, and a mustard-pot, and a vinegar cruet; I took a key from his breeches pocket, and went to his lodgings on Saffron-hill, and Jonathan Trott went with me, we found a great many more things.
(To Mr. Burn.) Is there your mark on them?
Yes, P on the five glasses; I am sure they are my property, this is the paper they were in.
What did the prisoner say?
The first excuse he made was, he said he wanted them for his own use, and afterwards he said he was a deserter from the Guards, and he wanted to make a present of these to his serjeant to keep his desertion a secret.
