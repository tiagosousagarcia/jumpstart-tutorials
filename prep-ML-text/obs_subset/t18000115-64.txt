I am servant to Mr. Richard Kirby , a carrier : I lost a flat of butter from the side of the waggon, it was put down upon the wheel, in the passage going down to the Oxford-arms Inn, Warwick-lane ; I saw the prisoner at the bar take it away from the waggon; I called to the porter to stop him; I followed him, overtook him, and brought him back again; I saw the porter stop him at the bottom of Stationer's-alley; we made him bring it back to the place he took it from, he had it with him when he was stopped; Mr. Kirby's name was upon it; the flat is here, but the butter was taken out; the constable has it.
Did you say, before the Magistrate, that you saw him take it from the waggon?
Yes.
Do you mean to swear that?
Yes.
The waggoner called to me, and I pursued the prisoner; and never lost sight of him till I caught him with the flat of butter upon him; I brought him back, and he was delivered to the constable; Mr. Kirby's name was upon the flat.
I had been out in the morning to buy some articles, I met a man who asked me to carry it for him, which I did out of compassion; Eyre told me their master was a very severe one, and he should lose his place if he did not come forward against me; he was obliged to say what his master pleased, or he should be turned away.
I never said any such words; I never said any thing like it.
