I live in Swallow street , I am a book seller . The books were the property of a lady, she had given them to me to bind. I missed them in March, I found them at the pawnbroker's.
I am a pawnbroker's servant. I produce three volumes of Rosseau's works, they were pledged on the 12th of March, but by whom I do not know.
