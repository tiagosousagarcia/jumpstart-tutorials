I am a labourer at Whittendon, in Gloucestershire; I lost the things mentioned in the indictment, at the Red-lion in Stanmore; I came up to make the best of my time to work; I gave the things to the young mistress of the Inn, and bade her take proper care of them; her name is Susannah Wells ; she is not here; I found the things upon the prisoner last Sunday was se'night; he stripped off the handkerchief and waistcoat, and said they were mine, and he would not carry them any further; he did not tell me how he came by them; I never saw the prisoner before I lost the things.
What age are you, my boy?
About fourteen.
Do you know the nature of an oath, what will become of you in the other world if you swear falsely?
I shall go to hell.
Who is your father?
William Newland ; I live at the Red-lion at Stanmore; the prisoner came to me and asked me for the things that were the other man's, and I gave them to him; I gave him a bundle, I cannot tell what was in it, and I gave him a scythe, he said, he was going to hay making, they were both going together, and he told my mistress there was no work for him, and he came for the bundle and the scythe; I saw the prosecutor deliver these things to Susannah Wells .
The prosecutor was a countryman of mine; we were at work both together, we had been drinking, and I made more free than I should have done, because he was a countryman of my own; I should not have done so with any body else; I went to get the things to give him.
