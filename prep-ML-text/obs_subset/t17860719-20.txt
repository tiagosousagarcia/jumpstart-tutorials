I lost my handkerchief about a quarter before four; I felt somebody at my pocket, and saw the prisoner with my handkerchief in his hand; I went to make a snatch at his collar, he bobbed back that I should not catch him, and he dropped it
at my feet, and ran across the street, he was immediately stopped going into Field-lane; he was never out of my sight; he snatched at my nuckles, and cut a bit out of the back of my hand; it was sore for some time; I had him secured.
I found the witness under great difficulty to obtain an officer; I gave him my assistance; I saw nothing of the fact; I kept the handkerchief; it was given me by the alderman.
Going up Holborn-hill, much about the same time the gentleman lost his handkerchief, two men were behind, a person called out my name David, I went over the way to him, and the gentleman said I picked his pocket; he found no handkerchief about me.
