On the 15th of April, at night, while I was in the stable, the prisoner crept in through a hole that was stopped up with some litter, and set open the door, and then took down one saddle; I was lying down, waiting, expecting somebody to come; I saw him take one saddle down, and lay it at the door; then he took the other, and laid it upon it, and then put them both on the dunghill; then he went and looked up the yard, to see if there was any body; then he came and took the saddles, and was going off: I went immediately and stopped him with the saddles over his shoulder; he went down on his knees, and asked me to forgive him; I took him to a public-house, and gave a constable charge of him.
Who did the saddles belong to?
Mr. Brice; they were valued at a guinea.
I never was in the stable, nor never meddled with the saddles.
How came you to watch?
Because a coat had been stolen out of the stable before. It was a boarded stable, and the bricks, under the boards, were pulled out.
