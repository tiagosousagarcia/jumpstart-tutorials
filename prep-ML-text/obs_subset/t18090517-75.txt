I am an anchor-smith and founder ; my partner's name is John Johnson , father and son. Where this was stole from is at Wapping dock , we have one workship there, it was stolen out of the work shop.
Did the prisoner work for you
He did, in November and December last.
Do you know the fact of his having stolen it
No.
I am a watchman. On Tuesday morning I stopped the prisoner with this iron on his shoulder, it was a little after four o'clock, in Penning-street, I asked him where he got the iron from; he said he had brought it from Deptford. I detained him, I told him he must go to the watchhouse; he then endeavoured to throw the iron on my partner that is here. He made resistance; I tore his coat. I took him to Lambeth-street office; I went round to all the iron founders, I found it belonged to Mr. Johnson.
I bought it of a waterman by the water side; he is not here.
