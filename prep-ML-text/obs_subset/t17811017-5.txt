I am a bricklayer and plaisterer. The prisoner worked for me. I am repairing some houses for Mr. Mabberley, in Newtoner's-lane . He called me up at six o'clock, and then went to work. About a quarter past seven o'clock, within about sixteen yards of Newtoner's-lane, I saw the prisoner with something in his apron. I called to him, to know what he had got in his apron. He said, Wood. He ran back to the building as fast as he could. I followed him. I saw him near a cellar, and then he had nothing in his apron. We went to the place I had seen him at, and there we found 18 lb. of lead.
I lit a candle, and went down into my cellar, at the request of Mr. Kendell; and there I found this lead. I had been down in my cellar half an hour before, and am sure it was not there then.
I tried this lead, and it exactly fitted the place from which the lead had been stolen.
When my master met me, and asked me where I was going, I went back to my work, for fear he should scotch me a quarter of a day, because I had left my work rather too soon. I had some chips and a piece of wood in my apron: I shewed my master the piece of wood afterwards.
