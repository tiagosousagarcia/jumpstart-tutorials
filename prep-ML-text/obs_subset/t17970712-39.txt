I am a taylor and salesman : On Saturday night, the 3d of June, the prisoner, and two others, came to my house in St. Martin's-lane , a little after nine at night, under pretence to buy some cloaths; one of them bought a coat and waistcoat; the prisoner tried several waistcoats, one was taken from him afterwards, he had it on his body, I missed two; on the Monday following he came past my door, without the man that bought the coat and waistcoat; I told him he should step back, he would not, and I called stop thief; he was taken to the watch-house, and then he offered me half-a-guinea for the waistcoat.
I am a constable: On the 5th of June last, I was at the watch-house taking some charges up, and seeing a piece of work I went up, and Mr. Rees gave charge of him; this waistcoat I took off his back,
This is my waistcoat, I have the fellow to it.
He said he would give you half-a-guinea; perhaps he said this: sooner than I will be brought before a Magistrate I would give half-a-guinea for it?
I cannot take upon me to say the exact words.
The prisoner said he had bought the waistcoat of a young man, and rather than go before the Justice about it he would give him half-a-guinea for the waistcoat.
