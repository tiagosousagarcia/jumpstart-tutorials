- I am a brazier ; I live in Oxford-street : On the 2d of November, I lost an iron grate from outside my house; it was over my cellar, in the street, fixed in a wooden frame: on the 3d of November, in the morning, the watchman missed it, and took the prisoner.
I am a watchman: On the 3d of November, at five o'clock in the morning, I was calling the hour in Southmolton-street; I saw the prisoner crossing the road with something weighty upon his back; I put my candle and lantern down, and pursued him; I saw him standing by the Globe-passage; I went over to him, and asked him what he had on his back; he said nothing, but a dirty shirt; I looked down behind me, and there was a dirty shirt round the iron; then he took the dirty shirt off the iron, and ran away as hard as he could run; I sprung my rattle, and cried stop thief; I caught the prisoner myself, and took him to the watch-house; I took the shirt out of his pocket; then he said, watchman, take care of that shirt, for it is my regimental shirt; I went back to the iron in about ten minutes; I found it where I left it; I tried the iron at Mr. Drake's, and it fits exactly. (The property produced, and deposed to by the prosecutor).
On the 3d of November, I was in Portland barracks; I was making the best of my way home; I stopped to make water at Southmolton-street; the watchman came up, and swore by his Maker, he would fix me; I thought he was going to strike me, and I made the best of my way from him, till I was took by another man.
