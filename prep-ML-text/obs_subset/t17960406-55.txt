I am a publican in St. Ann's, Soho ; the prisoner came to my house on the 21st of March, and called for a pennyworth of porter; she sat down some little time and drank it; after she had sat some time, she took an opportunity of going out to the back part of my house, where I usually put my pots; she came back and drank the remainder of her porter, and then went out; I did not miss the property immediately, but in the afternoon I missed two new pewter pint pots.
I am a constable of Vintry-ward: On the 21st of March, Mrs. Twitchell sent for me; I saw the prisoner in the passage behind the bar, at Mrs. Twitchwell's, the King's-head; I searched her and found one pot upon her, and three others she had in her hand, and one was fastened behind her, under her cloaths, (producing it)
This is one of the pots that I lost.
