- I am a linen-draper , at No. 66, Newgate-street ; I was not at home at the time of the robbery.
I am shopman to Mr. Harrison: On the 27th of September, about eight o'clock in the evening, I was folding a piece of linen, when I saw the prisoner come in, and snatch a piece of print from a horse on which it was hanging, on the inside of the shop-door; I pursued him, and took him with it upon him; I took him to the Compter.
- I was passing through the street, and saw the prisoner taken, with a piece of calico in his arms.( William Shepherd ,
I picked it up outside the door.
