My father is a bricklayer ; I am ten years old.
Do you know if it is a good or a bad thing to tell a lie?
If I tell a lie, I shall go to the devil.
You are now going to call God to witness the truth of what you shall say, and you will be punished in this world as well as the next if you say that which is false?
Yes. - (Sworn.)
Where does your father live?
No. 8, Willow-court ; the prisoner came to our house, I do not recollect the day, and said he came from Mrs. Meyrick for the cloaths to be washed; I am sure it was him, I had known him before a good while; I gave him two pair of stockings, three shirts, two shifts, and a frock.
Have you been always sure that the prisoner was the person?
Yes; I did not know where he lived, but I knew the street he lived at.
The prisoner was not taken up, but went to an officer, and surrendered himself upon hearing this accusation?
Yes.
The things have never been found since?
No.
Have you never said somebody gave you a halfpenny to let him have the things?
No; I followed the prisoner, and he gave me a halfpenny to go back again.
I am the father of the boy; I know no more than what he told me; he told me he knew the boy very well; that his brother had been playing with him, and I found him out.
I did not send the prisoner for the things; I do not know him.
God, the searcher of all hearts, can testify that I am innocent.
