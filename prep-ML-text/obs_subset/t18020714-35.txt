You are a drover , I believe?
Yes.
On the 5th of July last, were you in Whitechapel with any cattle?
Yes.
Which way were you going?
To Rumford.
At what time?
About ten o'clock in the day.
What number of bullocks had you under your care?
I had sixteen.
When you were at Whitechapel, did you see the prisoner at the bar?
No; I did not see him then.
How soon did you see him?
Just by the London Hospital.
What did he do?
He went into the drove, took one out, and took it down Duckingpond-lane with his hand upon the rump of the beast, and a knife in his other hand; after that, he came into the drove again.
What became of the beast he took out?
That bullock returned into the drove again after some time; he then said to some of his companions, draw your chives, that is, knives.
What number of companions had he?
Twenty, or more.
Did any of them draw their knives?
Yes; I saw three or four knives drawn; I cannot tell exactly the number.
Where did he drive the second bullock?
It was the same bullock again; he drove it towards Whitechapel; I sent my dog after it.
What did the prisoner do when he got a second bullock from the drove?
He followed it some rods.
Did you raise any alarm?
I did.
In consequence of that, did any persons come to your assistance?
A great number.
Did you and they pursue him?
I did, myself.
When you came hear him, what did he say to you?
He made a stop, and then made three stabs at my left breast with a clasp knife.
Did the knife penetrate it?
No; I felt my breast painful three or four days after; he then took to his heels, and before I could recover, he got a few yards from me; then I went after him, and called, stop thief, and when he found he was near being taken, he sat down on the but end of a tray with his knife out; he then said, the first b-r that comes in the way, I will let his b-y intrails out; upon that, some gentleman threw a brick-bat at him, struck him on the side of the head, and knocked him down, and then I seized him, and took him away to the Police-office.
Did you afterwards recover your bullock?
One Mr. Young did for me.
These bullocks belonged to you?
Yes.
On that day you were driving them from Smithfield?
Yes.
You did not observe the prisoner in Smithfield?
No.
Are you in the habit of coming into Smithfield frequently?
Yes.
It is a very wanton, but I believe a very common thing, for people of the description of the prisoner to drive bullocks out of the drove for amusement?
Yes, they do; I don't know what they mean by it.
The first bullock returned to your drove?
Yes; and it was the same bullock that he took out again.
The prisoner did not continue to pursue the bullock?
No; they all dispersed.
The bullock has been returned to you again?
Yes.
This was in the middle of the day?
Yes.
Coming down Whitechapel-road, Mr. Harper said to some of the chaps, he would treat them with half a pint of gin, because the beasts belonged to a very good master; he knows very well it was not taken with intent to steal it.
Do you know who this man is?
No; he goes by the name of Belcher, being a resolute man.
Do you know what way of life he is in?
No.
Did you never see him before?
Not to my knowledge; I have heard a great deal of talk of him. NOT GUILTY .
