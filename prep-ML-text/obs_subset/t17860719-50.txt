About two, on Sunday morning was a week, the 9th of July, I went to bed; I arose just before five; I was the last up in the family; at two in the morning I went into the back yard, and fetched some water to carry up stairs; and all the doors and windows were fast when I went to bed, when I arose the doors were unbolted, and the shop door was open, and the things mentioned in the indictment were gone.
On Sunday night the 10th, or Monday morning, I saw two common girls coming along Barbican; I took them to the watch-house; I found a pair of shoes about the girls; I had heard of this robbery; and at the bottom of the shoes I saw T. W.; when I went to the prisoner he said he gave the girl that pair of shoes at the Red Lion, the corner of Moorfields; he acknowledged so before Justice Blackborough; she said her name was Sarah Saint ; I put them both in prison; he desired to postpone it till the the next day, and then the Justice discharged him and the girl, and the prosecutor took the prisoner up again; I asked the prisoner where he had the shoes, he said he bought them on Saffron-hill at ten at night, and before the Justice the next morning he said he was drunk, and bought them of a Jew on Sunday.
I apprehended him last Wednesday morning; and when Mr. Westron came up, he said he would beat him with his double fist.
It happened to be my night to sit up, and the patrol Newman brought two girls into the watch-house on Monday morning; these are the shoes that were found on her; I know nothing more; the girl is not here.
There is no evidence at all that can convict the prisoner, there is nothing against him but that he gave this woman a pair of shoes that he bought.
