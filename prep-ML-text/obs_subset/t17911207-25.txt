I am a hat-maker . On the 28th of November, the prisoner came to work as usual; I gave him his work as usual; he took it up in the garret to bow it; I happened to examine it, and found that he had taken some beaver, and that he had taken out of the body, some material articles, to replace the beaver, on missing it, I sent my son to order him down stairs; I told him I suspected he had robbed me, and desired to know whether he would suffer me to search him: the constable came; he was searched by force at first; at length he consented, and we found this beaver; he then fell down on his knees, and said, the coney wool I bought of a journeyman; the beaver is yours; I cannot be positive to the coney wool.
I am a constable. I was sent for to take charge of the prisoner; I produce the materials.
My lord, I had three rabbit-skins at home, which I intended to convert into a hat for one of my children.
