I am a Police-officer, and was present when the prisoner was tried, and know he is the man who pleaded, and was convicted. This is a copy of his conviction.
I am a Police-officer, and apprehended the prisoner on suspicion of returning from transportation, on Sunday, the 30th of October , at the Star, Wentworth-street, Whitechapel .
I have nothing to say.
