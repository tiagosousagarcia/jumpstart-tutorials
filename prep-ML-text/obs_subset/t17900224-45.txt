I live in High Holborn . I keep a shoemaker's-shop .
When did you lose these boots?
On the 25th of January.
I am the wife of Henry Bell . On the 25th of January, about seven in the evening, the prisoner came into the shop; I was just within the parlour door, and saw him; and took two boots off two nails, which hung in the middle there were three lamps at this time: I was sitting in my parlour to watch the shop: he ran out; I went to the door, and called out, stop thief! the patrols stopped him, Michael Stack and John East : he was brought back to my shop: I am very sure it is the same person: the goods were not upon him when brought back.
Had you lost sight of the person from the time of his taking them, to his being brought back again?
No; he was brought back immediately; almost: I picked up the boots at the door of the next house.
I am a patrol. On the 25th of January last, my partner, John East and I, were standing in Holborn; I heard the word stop thief; I was within thirty or forty yards from Mr. Bell's shop, just the other side of the street; and saw a woman running in pursuit of the prisoner at the bar; who was also running; the prisoner got a bit a head of her; my partner and I pursued him, and brought him back; he had nothing with him.
Did you find any boots any where?
No; Mrs. Bell had them in her own shop: she owned them and the prisoner, immediately.
The patrol took them to the justice, and he marked them, and gave them to me to take care of.
I was going to my uncle's, who keeps the Green Man, at Marybone, and coming back I heard the cry of stop thief; and the patrols laid hold of me.
