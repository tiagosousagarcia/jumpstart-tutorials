On the 26th of October I lost the several things mentioned in the indictment (repeating them) from the Coach and Horses, Belton-street, Coal-yard . I was washing my pots in the yard; I saw the prisoner go up stairs, and come down with a bundle. I went up stairs about a quarter of an hour after and missed my things. We had lodgers in the house, so I thought she had gone up to some of the lodgers. Upon missing them I went to the first pawnbroker's, which was Mr. Mills, in Short's-gardens, there I found the hat. The prisoner was taken up at the Sun, the corner of Brownlow-street, the next morning. She was taken before the justice and there she owned she had taken the things.
Were any promises or threatenings made use of to induce her to own it?
No. She took us to Little St. Andrew's-street, and Lumber-court, where we found all the rest of the things.
I am a pawnbroker. I have a gown the prisoner brought to me to pawn, between eleven and twelve o'clock at noon of the same day it was stolen.
I have a bed-gown, but I could not find it; and I have a handkerchief I took in of her at the same time.
I keep a clothes-shop in Lumber-court, Seven-Dials. I have a stuff petticoat I bought the same day of the prisoner, in the open court. She was an old clothes woman; I have dealt with her before. The prisoner, the prosecutrix, and the constable came to my shop for it the next day.
I met a woman I had worked with at an upholsterer's; she said she wanted to make up her rent, and asked me to pawn these things for her, which I did.
