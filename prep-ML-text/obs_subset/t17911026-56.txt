I am servant to Mrs. Langhorne; the 4th of October she lost twenty-two pounds of bacon, it was Tuesday, half past seven o'clock; I was standing at the door, and I saw two men lurking about the window; I went over the way, I saw the prisoner go into the shop, and take two hocks of bacon. I went after him, and cried stop thief! Mr. Wiffin stopped him, the prisoner tumbled down, he dropped the bacon before that; I picked up the bacon; I never lost sight of him. Jacob Lodge has kept the bacon ever since.
I was going down Bartholomew-lane, the 4th of October, I heard the cry of stop thief; I saw the prisoner, he was walking down the lane, I took him; I saw the two hocks of bacon fall from him; he ran against Smart, and he fell down.
The prisoner was running in the lane, I crossed to stop him, and he kicked up my heels; I got up and pursued the prisoner.
Please you, my Lord, I was coming from work; I saw a man take the bacon, in running him I shoved this man down. Please you, my Lord, I served my seven years, and worked hard for my bread.
