I live in Carnaby-market , a butcher . Last Friday week I went to bed about eight o'clock, and the weather was hot, and I left two wether sheep hanging out, in the charge of the watchman, and one of them was missing when I got up, and I never found it since.
Coming from Newgate market, between the hours of nine and ten, on Saturday week in the morning; I stopped at Mr. Han's, in Broad St. Giles's, and I said, you, have got some nice mutton here; he had a leg, a shoulder, and two necks; and he said he bought it about a quarter of an hour before, of three men of Newport-market, and he said he did not know whether it was a ram sheep or a goat, and I said, it is my opinion it is the one that Mr. Hand lost last night.
Where did you get this mutton?
Three men were carrying it about to sell; Mr. Lyon told me that he thought it was Mr. Hand's sheep, and we went up to Mr. Hand's, and we went and took the prisoner as one of the men that I bought it of, the other two are no taken.
To Hand. You see the mutton that Hunt bought?
No, I did not go, I was very busy, it being Saturday; I never see it at all.
I am watchman in the market; about a quarter after nine last Friday week, I came into the market, and found it all in darkness; I see two of Mr. Hand's sheep hanging, and I put up the gates of the market for sefety, and went away till about ten o'clock, when I returned I found one of Mr. Hand's sheep were gone; I cannot tell who took it. The next morning I went down to Mr. Hunt's shop, to look at some mutton, and I have every reason to believe it was the same sheep, by the colour of it, and being so remarkably sat. I cannot swear it was, because the back of the sheep was all cut off, and a deal of the sat.
