The prisoner was my servant . My wife found a curtain hid in the prisoner's bed; upon her being charged with it, I heard her say she had pawned several other things. As we were going to the justice, I said, if she would tell me where every thing was, I would do the utmost I could to be of service to her.
What did she say before that?
That she had pawned several other things; and mentioned the other curtain, and the child's shirt; I do not recollect any thing else she mentioned. I went to the pawnbroker's immediately, and found several things.
I have a curtain here, and a shift; I have several other things at home, that Mr. Bailey could not swear to. The prisoner brought these things to me about the 27th of April last; I have known her backwards and forwards at my shop six or seven years. She told me where she lived, and said she brought them for her mistress: she had pawned things and fetched them out several times.
I thought to bring them home again as soon as my quarter was up; the Saturday following, I thought to bring them in again.
Is that so?
I can't tell exactly; she had some money of her quarter; she told me she meant to take them out.
