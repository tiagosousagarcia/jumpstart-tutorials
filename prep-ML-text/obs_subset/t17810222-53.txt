I was at the Hind in Redcross-street , Mr. Richmond's. I saw the prisoner take a pint
pot off the table and put it under her cloak. I called to the master of the house, and then she put the pint pot and a quart pot down on the table. Mr. Richmond sent for the prosecutor and he came and said the quart pot was his property.
I was sent for to the Hind; there I saw this pot (producing it) it is my property, it has my name upon it. The prisoner was there in custody.
I saw the prisoner in our house that afternoon. I am sure she is the same woman.
I picked up the pot at a door in Redcross-street, and was going to carry it home.
