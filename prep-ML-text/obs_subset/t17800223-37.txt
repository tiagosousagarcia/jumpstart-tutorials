I am a butcher . Yesterday se'nnight I went out about eight o'clock in the evening, I left seven carcases hanging in the shop. At about half after nine, my wife came to me at a neighbour's house, and said a sheep had been stolen. I went home and saw the sheep all over dirt. I went to the watch-house where the prisoner was in custody, and asked him where he got it. He said somewhere by the market. I asked him where abouts? and then he said from the door of my shop. He said another boy bid him go and take it.
Did you make use of any promise to induce him to confess?
No.
Or did you threaten him if he did not tell the truth?
No; I did not.
I went to Mr. Paul's that evening. I sat down in a little room within the shop. A little after nine o'clock I saw a carcass of a sheep taken out at the shop door.
Did you see any body take it out?
No; I did not. I saw only a part of it as it went out at the shop door. I went and called Stop thief! I saw the sheep on a man's shoulder; he threw it off his shoulder, and Mrs. Paul pursued him, I did not go after him.
I pursued the prisoner. I saw him cross the kennel, and saw the carcass drop, but did not see him throw it down. I followed him and cried Stop thief! till he ran through Elder-yard into Chapel-street, there he was stopped. I never lost sight of him from the time he ran from the sheep till he was stopped.
I saw the carcass lie on the ground. I was going to pick it up. A person cried, Stop thief! and then I threw it down and ran away.
