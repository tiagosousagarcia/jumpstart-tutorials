I am a butcher in Whitecross-street : On the 10th of July, the prisoner cheapened a haunch-bone of beef, for which I asked sixpencehalfpenny per pound; he said it would not do, and went away; my attention was drawn to another part of the shop, and when I turned my head, the beef was gone; I saw the prisoner about ten yards off, with the beef under his right-arm, which I took from him, and he was taken to the watch-house.
I worked till half-past eight, and bought a piece of beef in Newgate-market; going past that man's shop, he said, I must go back, for that I had stolen a piece of his beef; I cannot tell the name of the person I bought it of but it was at a shop.
I am sure it was my beef.
