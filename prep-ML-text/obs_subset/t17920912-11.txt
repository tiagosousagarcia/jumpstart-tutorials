I am a reed-maker , I lost my handkerchief about nine o'clock, in Bishopsgate-street ; I felt a pull, and turned round, and the prisoner ran into the middle of the street.
I am a porter, I heard the cry of stop thief, and saw the lad run, and the handkerchief drop from his hand; I picked it up, I gave it to Robert Sapwell .
I received a handkerchief from Mr. Bayley (produces it) ; I have kept it ever since.
I was coming up Bishopsgate-street, and I heard the cry of stop thief! and they stopped me; it was between nine and ten, and a very dark night.
