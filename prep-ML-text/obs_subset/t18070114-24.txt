You are a labourer in the East India company's warehouse.
Yes, I was employed at the warehouse in Cutler street, Hounsditch , at the same time with the prisoner. On the 6th of January I observed the prisoner at the bar sitting on a chest of tea, he appeared to me as if he was concealing some tea about his person. I went down and accquainted the elder Mr. Clements.
I understand you are assistant elder to this warehouse in Cutler street, Hounsditch.
I am. I went up to the prisoner, I ordered him down stairs. In consequence of what Buck said, I told him he had something about him that he should not have, he hesitated a little, I said it is of no manner of use hesitating; if he had got any thing to take it out himself, upon which he turned himself rather round, and in the presence of the commodore he took out a quantity of tea from his breeches. I looked at the tea to see if it corresponded with the tea in that floor where he was at work; it corresponded exactly.
I produce the tea; the tea weighed a pound and one ounce.
