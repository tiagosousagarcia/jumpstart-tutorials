I lost three guineas on board the ship I am master of , which was lying off Union-stairs on this side the river; I apprehend it was stolen from me on the evening of the 17th while I was asleep; it was in a purse in my breeches pocket; I missed it the next morning; I suspected the prisoner, and had him taken up.
The prosecutor came to the justice and got a warrant; I went on board the ship and took the prisoner; after I had taken him the steward and I went into the cabbin together. He told me he took the money out of his master's breeches pocket while he was asleep in the cabbin.
What did you say to him to induce him to confess?
I only said, what have you done boy with your master's money.
Did you tell him it would be better to confess?
No, I did not; I asked him what he had done with it? He said, he went ashore that same night, between eleven and twelve o'clock; that he met with two girls in the street; he said he talked to them some considerable time up an alley, and that he gave them two guineas. I asked him whether he went to any house to sleep with them? He said no, he did not; he came on board again at five in the morning; after that he said he went on shore on Saturday and spent a guinea, He made confession before the justice, which I saw him sign. (The confession was read in court.)
They coaxed me very much.
