I live at the Wheat Sheaf, Waltham-green ; on the 24th of June I lost three sauce-pans; they were taken out of the house.
I am wife of George Keene ; I missed the sauce-pans on the 24th, between twelve and one o'clock.
On the 24th of June, past two in the morning, my companion and I met William Gray , the prisoner, on this side Hyde-park-corner, with these three sauce-pans; we asked him where he had got them; he said he got them at Waltham-green; he said he was going to take them to Limehouse; we asked how he got them; he said from an honest man; we asked him what he was going to Lime-house to do; he said he did not know. We asked him how he came by them; he said a man gave him a pot of beer to carry these three saucepans from Waltham-green to Lime-house; we knowing certainly, that he did not come honestly by them, took him into custody, and brought him to Govent-Garden watch-house. I have kept the things ever since.
I went to Waltham-green, and found the people, and brought the three lids away, to see if they fitted, and they do exactly.
They appear very much like mine; I lost three such saucepans.
I was coming along, and I met with a person who had got these three saucepans, and he asked me if I would carry them along for him, and he would give me the price of a pot of beer; we were in liquor, and we laid down together and went to sleep, and when I awoke I found I was alone, and I went on about my business, and that made me so late out.
