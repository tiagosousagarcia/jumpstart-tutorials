I am a sadler , and live in King-street, Golden-square. On the 2d of June, I lost my watch, at a place called Miffin's-alley , between one and two o'clock in the morning. I met the prisoner in Long-lane, Smithfield. She asked me to go with her to her lodgings. Unfortunately I went along with her. We had not long been there, before another woman came up; and we sent for a pot of beer. We drank some beer. I rose up, and was going home. They were desirous of my stopping there all night. Accordingly I did. I went to bed; and the gentlewoman that came to the room came to bed to me: the prisoner continued to walk about the room. She came and took my breeches from under my head.
How do you know she took the breeches? Did you see her take them?
No. There was nobody else in the room. She took what was in the breeches, and flung the breeches into the room again.
Did you see her fling them into the room again?
No.
Did you feel her take them?
No. I had not been in bed ten minutes, before she went out: the other got out of bed, and followed her. Then I suspected something. I looked for my breeches, and they were gone. I lost the things mentioned in the indictment (repeating them) my buckles were taken out of my shoes, which were at the foot of the bed.
Did you look at the woman when she got out of the bed, and followed the prisoner?
Yes.
Had she any thing in her hand?
No.
Was there any light in the room?
Yes, a candle. She got out of bed, and followed the other down as fast as she could.
Did you ever get your watch again?
No.
Or any of your things?
No. I am sure she took them, because I kept looking at the other all the while I was in bed.
I am innocent of what I am charged with.
