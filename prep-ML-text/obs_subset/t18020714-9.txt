I am servant to Mr. Harvey, floor-cloth manufacturer at Lambeth, he has a shop, No. 57, Broad-street, Bloomsbury ; On the 5th of June, I was at the George and Crown, having a pint of beer after my dinner, about half-past two o'clock, nearly opposite my master's; I observed the prisoner reaching over some Chinese railing that was fixed in the front of the shop; I saw him try the hatch door to get in; I then saw him put his foot upon the scraper, and get over the rails, and in at the shop window; I ran over from the public-house, and when I came there, he had got this piece of floor-cloth under his arm, he had not got out of the shop; I stopped him, and took it from him.
I was in a very bad way, and could not do any work; I don't know any thing about the oil-cloth. GUILTY , aged 65.
