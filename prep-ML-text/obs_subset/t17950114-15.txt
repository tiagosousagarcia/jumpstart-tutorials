I am a warehouseman in Basinghall-street .
Was the prisoner at the bar your servant or apprentice?
No, I never knew him; I never knew of the loss of the cloth till I heard of it; I lost it from my war house.
When had you last seen it before it was stole?
I cannot recollect having seen it for some time; it has my mark and stamp on it, and it appears by my book that I never sold that piece.
Your servant might have sold it in your absence?
It is regular to enter every thing sold in the book.
Last Thursday morning, about half after eight o'clock, I saw the prisoner in company with two more, looking into different warehouses in Basinghall-street, looking into windows and door ways; I perceived the prisoner at the bar to open the door of Mr. Andrews's warehouse, and walked in; I see him go in, and had suspicion he was going to bring something out; I went after a constable; returning back I see Prior, the officer, with the prisoner, and the property under his arm in the street.
I have got a piece of cloth, the prisoner brought it out of Mr. Andrews's warehouse; I was on the opposite side of the way, I saw him come out of the door with it; I detected him within ten yards of Mr. Andrews's warehouse; he said, if I would forgive him, he would not do so any more.
That piece is my property, I know it from a seal that it has, and the character of the cost price.
Did you mark it yourself?
No, it has a leaden stamp with
You have no doubt of its being your property?
No, none in the least.
