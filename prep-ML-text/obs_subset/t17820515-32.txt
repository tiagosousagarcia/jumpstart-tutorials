I had a ruffled shirt of Richard Sanderson 's to wash; he said it cost a guinea and a half; it was the second time of its being washed. The prisoner washed for me. On missing an apron, I went and searched the prisoner's lodgings; I found the apron: I then charged her with the shirt; she denied having it. I afterwards traced this shirt to a Mr. Hill's, a pawnbroker's.
I am an old-clothes woman. I went with the prisoner to Mr. Hill's; I paid 4 s. 6 d. to redeem a shirt there, and gave her 18 d. more for it.
I am servant to Mr. Hill. I saw the prisoner in the shop at the time she redeemed the shirt, and saw the apprentice give it to her.
