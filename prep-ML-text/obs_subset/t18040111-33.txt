I am a linen-draper , in Holborn; I know nothing of the robbery.
I am shopman to Mr. Woollatt, No. 53, Holborn-hill : On Monday, the 26th of December, the prisoner, in company with another woman, came to ask to look at some gown pieces; I shewed them a number, and the other woman purchased six yards, for which she paid two shillings in part payment; they went out, and I went to the door; the woman who purchased the gown turned and looked behind her; I thought her countenance was much confused; I got my hat, and went after them, and when I got to Bartlett's-buildings, I saw the prisoner running very fast; I ran after her, she stopped, and said, if you will forgive me, Sir, I will give you up the property; I took hold of her hand, and desired her to walk back with me, which she did, and put her hand to her pocket-hole, and pulled out two gown pieces of four yards and a half each.
You dealt with the other woman?
Yes.
That occasioned you to follow them?
Yes, I had hardly left them a moment.
During the time you got your hat, might not the woman who you served have given the prisoner the cotton?
I am sure the other woman did not take any thing.
Were there other people in the shop?
Yes, Mr. Woollatt, and his brother, who is not here; and there might be others.
I leave my defence to my Counsel.
