I am a watch-case maker , 22, Featherstone-street, St. Luke's . On the 5th of January, about two o'clock in the day, the prisoner came to be my errand boy , he staid till past eight o'clock and then went home; I left him in the work shop when I bid him go home, and I went down stairs; in about five minutes I heard the door go; he went home. At about eleven o'clock at night I went up into my workshop, I then missed a silver watch.
When did you see the watch there before
At a quarter past eight I had the watch in my hand, I placed it on a small scale board at the back of my lathe, where I work; my suspicion fell on the prisoner; I went to put my great coat on, which I had left in the passage, to go to where he told me he lodged. No. 15, Little Britain, my great coat was gone; I went to where he told me he lodged, there was no such person lived there. On Sunday morning I found him in Angel-court in Grub-street, I sent for an officer and he was apprehended. When the prisoner was apprehended, he then said a man of the name of Worthy had the watch, he gave it him; and the great coat was pawned in Houndsditch.
Have you seen the watch since
No; I have found the case, but not the watch. The case and the coat were pawned at Mr. Barker's in Houndsditch.
I live with Mr. Barker in Houndsditch. On the 6th of January last the prisoner pledged this coat with me for seven shillings; and he left a watch key with me to put a pin in the joint. I am sure the prisoner is the person.
I am an officer On Monday last I went with the prosecutor to Mr. Barker's in Houndsditch, I received this watch case; the pawnbroker put his mark on it before he gave it me; I asked the pawnbroker about the coat; he said the person that pledged the coat, left a case to have a pin put in.
I am very sorry for the offence I have committed; I hope you will have a little mercy on me, I will never do so any more.
