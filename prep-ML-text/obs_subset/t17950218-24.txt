I am a linen draper .
Did you at any time lose any shawls from your shop?
Yes, five.
What may be the value of them?
Twelve shillings. The 17th of February, the prisoner at the bar along with another woman, came into my shop and wanted to look at some cloth; I shewed two or three pieces, and sold them five yards and a half; after that they wanted to look at some shawls; I shewed them a great many different patterns, I had no pattern that would please them, I missed one pattern of shawls, and by the behaviour of the prisoner at the bar I supposed that she had them; I then called my young man out of the back shop, and sent him for a constable; the constable came, and I gave him the charge of this woman, the prisoner at the bar, and told him that I had a suspicion that she had some of my property, and the constable searched her and found the shawls on her; the constable has got them, his name is Moring.
I took these three shawls out of the prisoner's pocket, in Mr. Mather's shop, and my brother officer has got two that he found himself.
I know them to be mine by the shop mark.
I have got two shawls.
Where had you them from?
Out of the prisoner's pocket in Mr. Mather's shop.
They are my property, they have the shop mark.
My friends were with the prosecutor yesterday, and he promised faithfully he would not appear against me; therefore I have none of my friends ready. It is but five weeks since I buried my husband, and he has left me with two children. A young woman was out of place, and asked me to go with her to buy a shawl, and we drank a little two much, and when I drink a little spirits I have a very bad head, and how those shawls came into my pocket I really don't know.
