I live in High-street, Mile-end New-town , we have part of a house; I missed the things mentioned in the indictment, on Easter Sunday; I went up stairs between eight and nine to make the bed, and found the bedstead half up and half down, and propped up with a board, I left it turned up in the morning, I saw the things some time in the day, the sheet had a mark of L. M. and I think an I. I know the counterpane, it is very remarkable, I never saw one of the pattern before, it is a foreign thing, I saw the property at the office, and knew it to be mine.
I have been lately a victualler, I live at No. 262, Whitechapel road side; on Easter Sunday I was sitting by my fire side, I heard the voice of a person, asking will you buy an old blanket of a poor woman come out of the country? and I said to my wife, this has not a good look, I went out to the fore apartment, and instead of this blanket it proved to be these things; the woman that brought them was the prisoner, she was offering it to the woman that lives in the fore parlour, and sells apples; I followed the prisoner to the George in Whitechapel road; I believe the prisoner saw me follow her, as she said, she would be damned if any body should have any of the things, for the property was her own; and I applied to John Roberts and Forecast, and they took her into custody.
I am an officer, the last witness applied to me, at the Rotation-office, to take the prisoner into custody, and I took the prisoner with this bundle on her head, these are the things that Mrs. Russel speaks to, they were sealed up.
I am an officer, I assisted to take the prisoner with the bundle.
I was going along up the new road going to Limehouse, and I met two men, they had this bundle at their back, and they gave me this bundle and I went with it, I did not know it was stolen, I was in liquor the two men were to meet me after I had sold the things.
