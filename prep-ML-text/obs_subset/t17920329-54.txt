I live in Charles-square, Hoxton . I lost an iron bar, I believe it was last Saturday se'nnight.
On the 17th of March I saw the prisoner with this iron bar, and another at half past six in the morning, in Whitecross-street; I stopped him; and he called two others, and one came up and kicked me, and the prisoner kicked me.
I am a plaisterer. On the 17th of March I was going to work with my master, the last witness. (Deposed to the same effect.)
I found these bars almost covered with dung.
