I am a yearly servant to Mr. Beckman; about half past two on the Wednesday morning, I went out, and took a stick in my hand, and I saw the prisoner on the warehouse, in the gutter; I said to him, d - n your eyes, do not stir, I have got you; to which he said, d - n your eyes, you lye, you b - r; upon that I knocked him down, and he ran over upon a necessary, and my fellow servant John Law and me took him, and gave him to the patrol; the lead was missing, and thrown down on some waste ground; there were two pieces cut out of the gutter, and then the remaining part was lifted off; it was newly cut, and a knife found on the house; the garden belonged to another house; I could get to the garden from the gutter with ease; I saw the lead compared, and it fitted the gutter; I never lost sight of the prisoner.
I took charge of the prisoner and the lead.
I am a plumber; I matched this lead; it corresponded; it weighed one hundred and four pounds.
I had been out a drinking.
