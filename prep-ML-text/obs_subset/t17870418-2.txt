I keep a linen draper's shop in West-street St. Giles's ; on Easter Monday, the 9th of April, I lost a piece of linen; the prisoner came in; she was standing close by where this linen was; I think it was in the forenoon, I am not sure as to the time I saw her; I was waiting on two customers; I was close observing her, and in a moment I missed her, and thought she must have something, as she went out without asking for anything; I followed her out of the house, and as soon as I was on the outside of the door, I immediately saw the linen under her arm, part of it her cloak did not cover; I took her into custody I believe about five or six yards from the door; I had not time to miss any thing before I pursued her; this is the linen, it is worth thirty shillings; it was the top piece; it lay where she was standing; as soon as I came in I looked, and it was gone; I had seen it not five minutes before; it was piled up in the shop on a pile of carpetting; I was quite near to her.
I saw Mr. Gibson have hold of the prisoner with one hand, and the piece of linen with the other; the linen has been out of my sight since the prisoner has been committed, but this is the same pattern; our private mark is not upon it, therefore I cannot positively say it is the same piece.
You have no doubt but it is your's?
No, I am quite clear of it, for I cut the printer's name out of one corner of it myself.
I never saw it; the gentleman brought it out of me, and said he suspected me some nights before; and he said before the Justice, he would bring several people to witness that he took it from me; I leave it to the Court; I am innocent.
