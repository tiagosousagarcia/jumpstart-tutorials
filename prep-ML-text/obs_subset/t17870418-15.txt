A man run against me, and I thought he made a push at my handkerchief, just by the Mansion-house; a gentleman said, you have lost your handkerchief, and he run after the prisoner and caught him; I saw him caught; he never was out of my sight; I took my handkerchief out of his bosom; he said he picked it up in the foot path; I took him into custody.
I have nothing to say.
