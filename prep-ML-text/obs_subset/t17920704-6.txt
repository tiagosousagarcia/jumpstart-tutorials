I live at No. 3, Great York-street, Swan-yard, Shoreditch ; I have a house there. I am a copper-plate printer, and keep a chandler and cook's-shop . On the 23d of June I lost a watch out of the back-room adjoining to the shop. A gentleman was there at dinner and the prisoner; I had some victuals in the same room where the watch was. About two minutes after the prisoner went out, I missed the watch; I pursued the lad and got sight of him; he ran when he saw me, and he took down a passage; I saw his hand move, and I took him; he denied having the watch, and then said there is something there, and the watch lay behind a shutter.
It cost three guineas and an half when new; I have had it some time; the chain and seals cost 6 s. 6 d. The prisoner was secured.
I was in this room at dinner. I saw the watch behind me when I went into the shop, and it was 18 minutes after twelve. The prisoner came out; the watch was missed, and the prisoner pursued; he went down a passage, and I saw him throw the watch behind a shutter, and shew Mr. Rowntree where the watch was.
One day I was in great distress, and a gentleman came up and gave me 3 d. and I went into the shop: the gentleman was ringing the bell for coals. I was in great distress, out of place, and it was necessity made me take it; it is the first error I ever was guilty of, and I hope you will have a little mercy. I have no friend in the world but my mother; she lives at No. 52, in Skinner's-street; she knows I am in goal.
