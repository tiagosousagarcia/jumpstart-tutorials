I am the wife of William Hill , who is abroad; I live in a lodging-house in Church-lane, St. Giles's . The prisoner came on a Friday about five weeks ago, and slept a few hours in a bed in the same room I sleep in; while I went down stairs, she went away with the things mentioned in the indictment (repeating them) About fourteen days ago I met her in Dyot-street; she had my bonnet and ribband on her head; I never found any of the rest of my things.
I was sent for to take charge of the prisoner; the bonnet and ribband were found upon her.
I bought the bonnet in Covent-garden.
