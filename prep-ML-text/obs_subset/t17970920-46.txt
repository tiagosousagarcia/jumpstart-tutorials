- I am servant to James Wild , John Watts , and John Boddy , wholesale grocers and tea-dealers , No. 106, Upper Thames-street : On the 29th of August, about seven in the evening, I came home, and enquired if all the porters were gone; I found they were all gone but one, which was the prisoner; I heard a little noise in the warehouse, and I went to see what it was; I found the prisoner at the bar a little in liquor; I asked him what he was about, and he said he was untying his apron; I told him not to go out just then, as Mr. Watts and Mr. Boddy were standing where he was to pass; he had been a very good servant, and being in liquor, I thought they would discharge him for it; I told him I would untie his apron, and in feeling for the hook of his apron, I felt something very bulky in his small clothes; I said, Ben, how could you serve us so, we put more confidence in you than in any person in the warehouse; says he, then you are deceived for once, I want to go to sea, I can get more wages at sea than you can give me here; I sent for a constable, who searched him, and found seven pounds of sugar in a paper bag in his small clothes; I went directly to where I thought the sugar was taken from, and there were the marks of fingers in it; I cannot swear to the sugar, but I believe it was ours.
He had been a very good servant?
Yes, till that time; he had been with us two years; he used to come and brew for us once a fortnight at twelve o'clock at night, and he had the range of the warehouses.
There is no mark either upon the sugar or the bag?
No, there is not.
- I am a constable; I was sent for to take the prisoner into custody.
This is the kind of sugar that was in our warehouse.
I had been hard at work at the fire that evening, rolling the sugar up; I drank a good deal of porter, and after that gin and water; I don't know whether I had the sugar or not.
I had given him gin and water to keep the cold out; he had been at work at the fire.
