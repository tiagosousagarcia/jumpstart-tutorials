I am clerk to James Oldroyd , Richard Masheter, and Richard Watson : The prisoner came to our shop; I was sitting at the desk; the prisoner did not see me; he cast his eyes round the shop, and lifted up his hand, as if he was going to take some goods, when I called to him, the moment I called to him, he took hold of two pieces of calico, and ran out of the shop; I pursued him; he ran against a boy, which knocked him down; I then secured him with one hand, and the calico with the other; it has our private mark upon it.
Two boys ran against me, and knocked me down; one of them dropped a piece of calico close by me, and this gentleman came and took me up. GUILTY , aged 12.
