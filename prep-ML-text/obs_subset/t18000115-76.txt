I am a tailor : On the 8th of December, I was coming up East-Smithfield , and lost my pocket-handkerchief out of my pocket, it was a linen handkerchief; I felt the prisoner's hand in my pocket, I turned round, and seized him with my handkerchief in his hand; and I took him immediately in the street.
I was going home, and no doubt I might run against the gentleman; but the handkerchief I never had, nor I never saw it.
