I am a labourer : I lost three shirts; I live at Longford ; the shirts were hung in the orchard; they were lost about three weeks ago.
I received these shirts from Mr. Fellowes, the magistrate.
I know the shirts by the buttons.
The prosecutor gave me charge of the prisoner, and gave me the shirts.
I saw the prisoner take the shirts off the line, and drag them to a ditch, and I pursued and took them.
