On the 27th of last month, I met with the prisoner in Fleet-street, after two o'clock in the morning; she asked me what I would give her to drink; I said, I did not know where to get any thing myself; she took me to the White Horse, in Clare-market ; I spoke to the landlord for some purl, and while I was speaking to him, I found her picking my pocket; I put my hand to my pocket, and missed a seven-shilling piece and six shillings and sixpence; I had been drinking, but knew what I was about; I had been locked out from my lodging, and was very cold; I had counted it about ten minutes before by a lamp near a watchman.
What are you?
A journeyman shoemaker ; she then came a second time to my watch; I twisted the chain round my hand, and said, I shall give charge of you; a watchman immediately came in, and I gave charge of her.
I am a beadle; the prisoner was brought to me; I searched her, and found a seven-shilling piece and six shillings and sixpence, and an old housewife; there were a great many people in the watch-house; I endeavoured to quell the riot, and she took the money, and put it in her pocket again.
I am a patrol belonging to Bow-street; I searched the prisoner between eleven and twelve o'clock on Tuesday the 27th of December; I found a seven-shilling piece, two shillings in silver, and a sixpence.
I left the prisoner in the watch-house, at six o'clock in the morning.
This man was very much intoxicated, and had not two-pence to pay for a pint of purl.
(To Rickman.) How was Gallie when you saw him?
Half drunk.
