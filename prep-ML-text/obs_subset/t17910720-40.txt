I am the wife of William Bowell : on the 13th of June, Thomas Morgan came and took lodgings; when his week was up, he did not pay me; on the Tuesday after his week was up, I went to speak to him about it; I told him; he said he would call; he went out, and about five o'clock in the afternoon I went up and found Mr. Mackintosh's trunk broke open; he had been a lodger, and had gone away, and left his property in my custody: at two o'clock the prisoner came and knocked at the door, and I let him in; he went to bed; and at three o'clock, when the watchman came, I called him, and we went up and took him; the coat he had on, when I let him in, was Mr. Mackintosh's; we found some duplicates in his pocket, which led us to a pawnbroker's.
I am a pawnbroker: I received a pair of nankeen breeches, and a half handkerchief; I believe I took them of the prisoner.
I produce the duplicates found upon the prisoner.
I bought these things of a young man that lodged at the place before me.
When had you last seen the things?
I had seen the coat about eleven o'clock that day.
