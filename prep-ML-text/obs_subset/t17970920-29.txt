- I live at South Shields, in the county of Durham: On Sunday last I lost my jacket, waistcoat, and silk handkerchief, from on hoard the Unicorn, at Blackwall-dock , they were in my chest, upon the half-deck, I was not in the ship at the time; I saw the things taken from the prisoner when he was brought back.
- I was on board the Circe, which was lying close to the Unicorn: I heard somebody crying murder, and I went after the prisoner, I caught him upon the wharf, and brought him back; I took him on board the Unicorn, and searched him, I found this brown jacket and waistcoat upon him, under his shirt; and upon pulling his jacket off the silk handkerchief tumbled out; he went down on his knees and asked me to let him go; I told him I would not; and took him to the watch-house.
- I am the wife of John Grays; I was in the master's cabin dressing myself; I heard somebody up stairs; I looked, and saw the prisoner take these things from where the sailors sleep.
I went on board to beg a little victuals, and I told the woman so; she said, I had been taking something; I said, I had not, and I went on shore; they came after me, and took me; they found the things in the cabin.
