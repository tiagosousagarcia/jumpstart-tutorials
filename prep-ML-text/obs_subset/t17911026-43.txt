I live on Holborn-hill ; on Monday, the 24th of this month, I lost eight yards of callico from the door of my shop, between seven and eight, I saw it taken by the prisoner. I was standing in the shop at the time he came into the door, I observed him take it, tear it away, and run off, I pursued him, saw the callico upon him, and took him at the instant he dropped it, it is in this paper.
I saw this callico on the ground, and got my feet in it, and the gentleman came and caught me, and swore I was the prisoner.
