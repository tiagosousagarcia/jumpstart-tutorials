On the 8th of July, about seven o'clock in the evening, as I was going through Islington to Hornsey , in a chaise, I met several country waggons; I saw a bail fall from the last waggon. I called to the waggoner to stop; by this time I had got to the tail of the waggon. I saw the prisoner drop from the waggon; I got out of the chaise and pursued him; he ran round the houses, and I lost sight of him for a few seconds. There was a gravel pit by the side of the house. A woman who was standing there said he had jumped into that pit. He immediately ran out of the pit again; I halloo'd to a man at a little distance, who stopped him. When he was before Sir John Fielding , he said he was only hanging to the ropes and the bundle fell upon him. The bundle was delivered by the magistrate to the book-keeper, or agent of the waggon.
I am a silversmith. I was on the road; I heard the cry of stop thief! I ran round the houses, and stopped the prisoner.
I am agent to the Nottingham waggon. I was sent for on the 8th of July to Islington, where I saw the boy and the truss. I have the bill of lading. I went to the gentleman's house who sent the truss, and he gave me the bill of parcels. The waggoner is at Nottingham; I wrote to him, but he cannot be here before Saturday. There is W B marked on the truss. I know it only from its corresponding with the bill of lading. I was at the unlading of the waggon, and saw there was a rope of the waggon cut.
I am thirteen years old. I was riding in the waggon; this parcel jostled out. The gentleman called out and I ran away for fear the waggoner should horsewhip me.
To Brown. Did you see any suspicious persons near the waggon?
I saw two men leaning over a stile about three hundred yards off, I suspect they were concerned by the information I received from the neighbours.
