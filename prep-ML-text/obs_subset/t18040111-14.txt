I am a carman in the employ of William-Storrs Fry , William Fry , and Joseph Fry ; I stopped with my cart in Wood-street, at the Castle Inn , between four and five; I left my cart with the chest in it, and went up the yard to get the book signed; I was gone about a quarter of an hour; when I got back, I got up and found the prisoner on the copse of the cart trying to get the chest off, but the cord catching one of the irons, he could not; he had removed it from one side to the other; I saw another standing close to the cart to receive it; the prisoner run away, I followed, and took him.
On the 4th of January I was going by Wood-street, I saw the prisoner and another standing under the cart close by the copse; the prisoner jumped up, and moved the chest; the carter took him, and I took the other, who was discharged by the Lord-Mayor, and sent on board a ship.
The copse was full of chests, therefore I could not move one from the other.
There was only one more chest.
