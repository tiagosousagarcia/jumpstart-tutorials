Last Monday I sent my servant John Bourne with some deal boxes; among the rest there was a box containing the goods mentioned in the indictment; to be delivered at Blossoms Inn, Lawrence Lane; he came back and informed me two men had taken it from him.
On Monday night I was sent from Mr. Smith's with a box to Blossoms Inn, Lawrence Lane; I went through the market but that door was fast; the prisoner and another man stepped up to me.
Are you sure the prisoner is one of them?
I am certain of it; when I came to a place that I thought was the passage into the Inn, they both told me I could not get through there; the prisoner took the box from my head and gave it to the other, and said, you take this box into the warehouse; I supposed the person he delivered it to to be one of the porters of the Inn; I did not know the prisoner; he told me he would book it; he called the other man Mr. Thompson, the other man took the box away and I never saw it afterwards; I followed the prisoner as he was to go and book it; the prisoner as soon as he came through the passage set off running; then I thought the box was stolen; I cried out stop thief! I thought till he began to run that he was the book-keeper.
Can you tell what was in this box?
It was perfumery goods, but I cannot tell what was in it.
To Mr. Smith. What were the contents of this box?
My clerk is here who packed it up.
I packed up the box; it contained the several articles mentioned in the indictment, (repeating them.)
What value do you put upon them?
About 30 or 40 s. they were delivered to the last witness.
To Bourne. Were the goods that were taken from you delivered to you by the last witness?
They were.
I met this man and another coming across Honey Lane Market; this man ran up to me, and asked for the book-keeper of Blossom's Inn, I said I did not know where he was; I walked on and he followed me. I am warehouse-man to the Morning-Post office.
