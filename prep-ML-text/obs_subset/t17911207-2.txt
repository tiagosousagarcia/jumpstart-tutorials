I live in Tavistock-street ; my partner's name is Edward Madgwick . The prisoner came to live with us on the 1st of March, and staid till the 29th of September. I heard the prisoner was stopped at a pawnbroker's, in Whitechapel; there were five yards and a quarter of printed callico; I searched his box on the 29th; the box was locked; the prisoner was present, he gave me the key; I found these two remnants of callico: they are marked Q. C. it is our private mark. The callico is our's, and may be worth 2 s. a small remnant of Irish. I found a key in his box. I went to Mr. White's chambers, in Lincoln's Inn, from some suspicion I had, and also from some information I had received, and found some property in a drawer.
The prisoner at the bar offered this remnant of callico to pledge. I stopped him.
I received this pledge from Joseph Dean .
I am a pawnbroker. I received these things from Joseph Dean .
I received these from Mary Lewis .
I received these things from Morgan Lewis.
There is a person here who was present when I bought some of these articles laid to my charge.
I am a barrister at law, the prisoner was my servant ; he was very honest during the time he lived with me.
