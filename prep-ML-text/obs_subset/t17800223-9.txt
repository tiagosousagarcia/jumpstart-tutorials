On Wednesday I came home, and my family told me that one of Sir John Fielding 's men had been to fetch my servant, the prisoner at the bar, on account of a pair of silver snuffers which had been offered to pawn by one of her acquaintance.
Did not you miss the snuffers when you wanted to use them?
They were snuffers for sale in the shop; I swore to them at Sir John Fielding 's. The prisoner was taken up in consequence of an old woman's impeaching her. She had been taken into custody and would not tell where she got the snuffers till the next day, when she said she had them of my servant, the prisoner.
These snuffers were brought to my house to pawn by Mary Warburton and the prisoner at the bar; Warburton came in with them and asked two shillings and sixpence on them. I said whose snuffers are they?
I received the snuffers of the prisoner for to pawn; I said they would not fetch above two shillings and sixpence, but Mr. Brown would give me but a shilling for them. I asked her if that would do; she said as you like. I took the shilling and gave it to her.
I would have called my master I lived with last, but I thought it would be to my prejudice, to see me in this situation. I should be glad to get a good place again.
