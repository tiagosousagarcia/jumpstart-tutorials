I am one of the overseers of St. Clement's . On the 23d of September Mr. Eglington, the master of the workhouse, applied to me, and informed me the prisoner, who was a pauper in the workhouse, had taken some sheets. I went with him to Mr. Davidson's, a pawnbroker, in Fleet-street, and found the four sheets pledged; but he did not deliver up the sheets till some time afterwards, till I got a warrant from the Lord Mayor.
Whose property are these sheets?
The property of the churchwardens and overseers of the parish (naming them). They belonged to the workhouse, and had the parish mark upon them, which is an anchor.
I am a pawnbroker in Fleet-street. I had three sheets; they were delivered up at the Mansion-house, to Mr. Eglington, the master of the workhouse.
I had these sheets (producing them) of Mr. Davidson, the pawnbroker; I have had them ever since; they are the property of the Parish of St. Clement.
The prisoner had a different appearance then, but I am certain she is the same person. She brought me a sheet and said her name was Jane Cartwright , and I lent her one shilling and sixpence; that was on the 29th of August. She said she was an house-keeper in Carey-street. The mark on the sheet was obliterated with whiting, that I really did not see it. The other two sheets were received on the 31st of August, and the 13st of September. They were taken in by my young man; I was in the shop when they were taken in. They were brought by the prisoner.
Did you observe no mark on the sheets?
I did not. The mark was in black, and was obliterated with whiting, on that I took in.
When was the fourth taken in?
That was on the 1st of August; I was not present then.
Were the marks of them all so defaced that you could not discern them?
I believe all the marks were defaced; they have been one with whiting.
I leave myself to the mercy of the court.
