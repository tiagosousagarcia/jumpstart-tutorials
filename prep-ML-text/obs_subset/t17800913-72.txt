I keep a green shop in White Cross-street . On the 17th of July, I went to Newgate-market at a quarter after five in the morning, I came back at six and found my door broke open. The staple was drawn; I missed the things mentioned in the indictment (repeating them) I found a hat, cloak, and apron at the pawnbroker's.
I bought these things in Rag-fair.
