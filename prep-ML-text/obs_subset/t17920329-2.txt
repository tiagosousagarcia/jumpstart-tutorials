On Friday, the 24th of February last, I was sitting at tea, about five o'clock, and had occasion to go into the yard; I saw the prisoner coming out of the parlour; I said, What do you do here? He said he wanted Mr. Jones, the watchmaker; I said, you are a thief, and I took him by the collar, and put him into the parlour; I searched him, and something fell from him; he knelt down and asked pardon, and said, that is all I got; I saw a silk and cotton handkerchief of my wife's.
I saw the prisoner coming out of the parlour; he dropped the caster tops into a basket; I saw him feeling about the pockets of his coat, and he dropped a handkerchief; I picked it up, and he dropped on his knees.
I was at work at Mr. Tovey's; I was called down stairs: he was on his knees, and I fetched a constable; he said that was all he had got.
I went into the parlour for some teaspoons just before the alarm, not five minutes before the alarm; the things were all safe.
