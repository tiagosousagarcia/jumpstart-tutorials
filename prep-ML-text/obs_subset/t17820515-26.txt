I am a taylor . I was employed to make a crimson coat and breeches for a gentleman in the city. I sent the clothes home by my son, on the 13th of April, wrapped up in a green wrapper.
I am thirteen years old. As I was carrying the clothes home, I stopped some time to look at a little horse; the prisoner came up, and said I had been loitering upon my business, and snatched the clothes out of my hand; I said he must return me the woollen bag. I apprehended he was the clerk of the gentleman to whom the clothes were to be delivered. He returned me the clothes and bag, and then I went on towards the gentleman's house; but, before I got there, he came up again to me, and snatched the clothes out of my hand, and was going away with them; I cried Stop thief! upon which the prisoner returned me the clothes, but made off down Thames-street, through an alley, to the Three Tuns, a public-house. I delivered the clothes at the gentleman's, and informed the servant what had happened; they pursued the prisoner to this public-house, where he was apprehended; he was carried before a magistrate, who committed him.
I saw the prisoner take the clothes from the boy; and, upon the boy's crying Stop thief! I saw him come back, and return them to him.
I am servant at the gentleman's house to whom these clothes were to be delivered. The boy informed me of the behaviour of the prisoner; my brother and I pursued him to the Three Tuns: when we came there, the prisoner acknowledged that he had taken the clothes from the boy, but said he had returned them.
I am brother-in-law to the last witness. I joined them in the pursuit to the public-house; the publican turned them all out into the court; then the prisoner attempted to run away; we pursued him, and secured him.
I had given orders to a taylor to make me clothes of a maroon colour; I thought these had been the clothes.
