I have kept a lodging-house about nine months, No. 19, Norwich-court, Fetter-lane ; I let lodgings to the prisoner, and another woman of the name of Smith, it was a weekly ready furnished lodging; they came on Tuesday the 10th of October, and continued till Thursday, early in the morning, when they went away, without giving any notice; I missed a large four-post bed hanging, like this, (produces a pattern of it;) six dozen yards of binding, a pair of sheets, a pair of pillow cases, a large blanket, a damask table-cloth, and a small decanter; I have never found any of the things since; the prisoner cohabited with a man of the name of Missling. under sentence of transportation, in Newgate; I took her in Newgate; I missed the things on the Thursday morning after they were gone.
Do you know how these two ladies got their livelihood?
Mrs. Smith told me she had a friend, a gentleman in Cheapside, that she lived over the water, and it was too far for him to come to visit her.
I take in needle-work, and have some little income coming in; I lodge with the last witness; all I know is, that the prisoner and the other woman were in the house about a quarter before twelve, when I went to bed.
I went as servant to Mrs. Smith; when the landlady asked her what capacity she was in, she said, she saw company; and my mistress and I quarrelled that night, and I have never seen her since; I know nothing of the things being gone.
