I am wife of Louis Lejeune , the prisoner and another came into the shop, at No. 8, Broad-street, St. Giles's , the 13th of December last; they asked to look at some caps; three of those cloaks I had just cut out, which laid upon the counter, in the mean while I was shewing the other party some caps, the prisoner at the bar got the cloak under her cloak, these two yards and a half of cloth that was cut out for a cloak; she was not gone out of the shop one minute when I missed my cloak; I immediately ran out in haste, in pursuit of them, but could not see them. I called at Lane's the pawnbroker's, in Holborn, and asked if such a thing was pledged, they answered no; and from thence I went to Drury-lane, to another pawnbroker's, and asked if such a thing was offered there, they said no; I returned home, and took a piece of the same stuff to Mr. Weston's, the corner of Hyde-street, and they answered no; I was going down Holborn to enquire farther, and the prisoner and the other was just opposite to Smart's Buildings: as soon as I perceived them, I jumped across the road, and laid hold of her by the hood of the cloak, and asked her what she had done with my cloak she took off the counter; with that I put my hand round her neck, and under her left arm, and took the cloak from her; with that they made a snatch at it, to get it out of my hand, and betwixt the scuffle she got it a little to the ground; I called out for assistance, and held her by the cloak till I got assistance; her partner said you have got your property, why not let her go; she scratched my hand, I had the marks on for a fortnight; I took her before a Justice, I kept the cloak ever since, this is it, it is my property, I had put it on the counter, the value is 7 s. 6 d.
I know nothing about the cloak, I never see the cloak before; I have no witnesses.
The stealing it privately is a capital offence, if above 5 s.
