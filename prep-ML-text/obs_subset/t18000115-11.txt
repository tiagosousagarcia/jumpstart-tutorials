I lived servant to Mr. Weeks, at the Black-boy, in Long-acre: On Saturday night, the 30th of November, I met the prisoner in Duke's-court , and he ordered a pot of beer to Mr. Sermon's, and change for half-a-guinea; I carried the beer and the change, and I met him again just before I got to Mrs. Sermon's; she lodges at Mr. Miller's, the Bow-street runner; and he told me it was to be change for a guinea; he desired me to give him the change for half-a-guinea, and he would go for change for a guinea, and I was to take the beer; he went away, and I saw no more of him for two days after; I am sure he is the same man.
I lodged at Mr. Miller's, and had done for five weeks.
When was he taken?
Not till the Friday week after; I saw him on the Monday, and one of the lodgers told me he lodged there; they told me that the person was gone out that I had brought the beer for; and I carried it back; afterwards I saw him come out of the house.
I delivered to the last witness a seven-shilling piece, three shillings, and four halfpence, in change for half-a-guinea; I never received the half-guinea; the prisoner was taken up on the 13th of December; I wished her to see him two or three times, to be positive before I took him up.
I never saw the girl with my eyes till the Friday, which was six days after the crime was committed that I am charged with; on the Monday night following, which was ten days after, the girl and her master came to the house while I was at work; I asked who they were, the master asked me if my name was Richardson, and I said, yes; and then the girl said, I was the person that she had delivered the change to; and the next day, Tuesday, I was taken up by a Bow-street officer.
