I live with Messrs. Joseph and Edward Aldridge , timber-merchants , the corner of Long-lane, Aldersgate-street: On the 29th of June, the prisoner was stopped by the watchman in Bunhill-row, with the property.
At four o'clock in the morning of the 29th of June, I saw the prisoner with a door upon his shoulders, I asked him whose it was, he said it was his mistress's property; I told him he must go before the officer of the night to be examined; my fellow servant came up, and he wanted to treat us with something to drink to let him go, but I would not suffer it; I sent my fellow servant with him to the watch-house, and took down the door myself.
This is my master's door, I had seen it between one and two the day before, it had been lying there before my master had the premises, my master had the key last quarter day.
I was coming along, and saw this door standing against a wall, and I took it along till the watchman stopped me.
