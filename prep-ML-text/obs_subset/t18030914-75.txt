- I live at No. 9, East-Smithfield ; I keep a house, and let lodgings: The prisoner came to lodge with me the 1st of July, she lived there till the 15th, when I missed her and the things; she was to pay four shillings a week.
I missed her, and when I went into the room the things were gone.
I took the prisoner into custody on the 30th of August; I searched her, and found forty-seven duplicates on her, among which was the duplicate of the sheets.
I live with Mr. Bourne, No. 55, East-Smithfield; I have one sheet which I took in, the other sheet is at Mr. Bourne's; I took this sheet of the prisoner, on the 8th of July; she pledged it for three shillings.
