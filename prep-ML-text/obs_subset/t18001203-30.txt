- I am a merchant ; my partners in this concern are James Brook and Henry Cooke; the sugar was lost from the warehouse that we are the proprietors of, that is all I know of it; it is called the Union-warehouse, in Thames-street .
I am foreman to Mr. Cookson: On Monday the 21st of November, the prisoner took an opportunity of going into the cellar under the warehouse, and plundering a hogshead; as I knew he had no business there, for I had not put him on to work, when he came out of the cellar, I asked him what business he had there; he had worked there two days before; he told me he was put on, but he could not tell by whom; I told him to put out the property that he had got about him; he said, he would not; he abused me very much, and said, neither I nor anybody else should take it from him; I sent for Mr. Cookson, and he gave charge of him to the constable; I saw a stocking taken from him, containing a quantity of sugar; it was under his waistcoat, next to his shirt.
Are Messrs. Cookson and Company responsible for the sugars in their warehouses?
They are for all losses; the sugar appears to be of the same quality with that in the cellar; there appeared to be about the quantity missing that he had in the stocking; the head had felf in by pirching the hogshead; it was there for the cooper to repair.
- I am a constable (produces the sugar) 1 was sent for, and I took the sugar from the prisoner in the leg of a stocking, wrapped round his body; there is about six pounds of it.
I found this sugar coming down Thames-street about six o'clock in the morning; I belong to the Coldstream regiment of guards; my serjeant has been waiting here all day, but is gone. GUILTY , aged 25. - Confined three months in Newgate , and delivered to his serjeant.
