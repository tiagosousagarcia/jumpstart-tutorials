I am a jeweller , I live in Oxford street, in the parish of Marylebone . On Monday the 26th of May about ten in the morning, I saw a mob passing by; I received information from my wife that the prisoner was in my shop about half an hour ago; I went to Marlborough street, and I saw the prisoner there.
Did you see any of your property there.
I saw four gold keys; the officer had them.
I was sent for to Mr. Johnson's shop, an umbrella maker in Oxford street; I saw the prisoner in the shop; he desired me to take her back wards and search her, I searched her and found these four gold keys and one seal; there was one that she bought of Mr. Tegg in a paper, which induced me to send to his shop; I produce the articles.
