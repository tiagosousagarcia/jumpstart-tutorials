I keep a house, No. 14, George-street, Portland-chapel ; my wife let the lodging: On Sunday, the 11th of May, I took the prisoner; my wife was with me; I secured him; he kicked at me, and got from me; my wife cried stop thief, and he was stopped at about seven yards distance; I never lost sight of him.
On Friday, the 2d of May, I let the prisoner a lodging; he was to pay three shillings a week; he took possession on Friday night; he left the key with my husband for me to make the bed; and on Saturday, the 3d of May, I gave him the key; I went into the room on the Tuesday following, and missed the looking-glass and sheets; I never saw him after till my husband and I met him on Sunday the 11th; he slept but two nights in the house; I always made the bed myself. I never gave the key to any servant; I went into the room and missed a pair of sheets and a looking-glass; the key was lost, and nobody could get in till we had the lock picked.
I never saw the prosecutor till the 11th of last month; I never was in London till the 9th.
I am perfectly sure the prisoner is the man.
