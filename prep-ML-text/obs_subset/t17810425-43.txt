On Sunday the 15th of October, I came home about ten in the evening, and was informed my house had been broke open.
I am servant to Mr. Howell. On Sunday the 15th of October, I had been in the room up one pair of stairs about four in the afternoon; the sashes were all close shut down then. About eight o'clock the ladies who lodged in the room came home; they could not get in; the door was fastened on the inside; they called to the servant, and the servant found two chairs laid back to back to the door to keep it shut: the servant pushed the door open; I went up with the ladies; we went into the room, and missed a counterpane off the bed in the next room to the dining-room.
Whose counterpane was that?
My master's.
I found the counterpane in the garret in the prisoner's house on the 26th in the morning, hanging on a line.
Did Bagnall say any thing about it?
He said it was his.
Whether, when Noon was tried, you said I owned the counterpane to be mine?
The judge did not go on with the evidence, but ordered the man to be acquitted, and tried on the other indictment.
I cannot swear to the counterpane.
Do you know that counterpane?
Yes; there are marks of ink on the corner: it is Mr. Howell's counterpane; the same that was lost off the bed the 15th of October; there is a mark across it, made by its hanging on a dirty line, which I know it by.
Did you find the windows open, when you went in at eight o'clock?
One window was quite up as high as it could be.
I am as innocent as the child unborn.
