I am an oilman : On Saturday, the 2dof October, about a quarter after one in the afternoon, passing along Lower Thames-street , I had my pocket picked of a silk handkerchief; I turned round and saw the prisoner and a man in sailor's cloaths, the only two men near me; they sprang into the middle of the road, and I after them; when I was within about a yard of them the man who was with the prisoner passed my handkerchief into the hands of the prisoner at the bar, from whose hands I took it, and afterwards carried him to the Compter, the other man got away.
I picked up the handkerchief on the spoke of a cart wheel; I don't know how it came there.
