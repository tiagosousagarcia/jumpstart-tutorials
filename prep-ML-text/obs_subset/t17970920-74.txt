- I live at No.45, Chandos-street, Covent-Garden ; I am a taylor : Last Thursday was a week, I lost the things mentioned in the indictment; they are worth about 30l. my shop was broke open; I had seen them at eleven o'clock the night before; I saw part of them again the next day at Bow-street.
- I am one of the officers of Bow-street; On the 8th of September, the morning after the robbery, I found six coats at a house, No.3, the back of Hungerford-market, upon a bed in the first floor; the only person in the care of the house was the prisoner; she did not give us any account how she came by them; I took her to Bow-street.
What sort of a house is it?
I believe it is kept by thieves; her sister is the landlady.
My father is in the hospital, and I went to sleep with my sister; she had only had the house one week; I sold oysters at the door; and as I was washing the oysters at the door, this gentleman took me; I know no more of the things than the baby that is within me.
