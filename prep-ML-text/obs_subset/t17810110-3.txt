I saw the prisoner going out of Daniel's shop, with a bag of green tea in his hand of 26 lb. weight, it was a little before seven in the evening of the 4th of this month.
Where is the shop?
No. 3, Southampton-street, Covent-garden.
Is it an open shop?
It is. He opened the door and came in.
Was the door shut?
Yes.
Did you see him come in?
No, but I saw the door shut not a minute before I saw him go out.
Might any other person have opened the door and come in in the interval of time; it is a shop I suppose where people are continually going in and coming out?
It is.
Then you cannot take upon you to be sure he opened the door; it might be opened by other persons?
It was shut not above a minute before.
The tea was Mr. Daniel's property and it was Mr. Daniel's dwelling-house, was it?
Yes.
I was going of an errand to Pimlico, coming up this street they called stop thief! and laid hold of me.
To Fisher. Did you take him with the tea upon him?
I saw him throw it out of his hands on the other side of the way; I saw him go from the door, and cross the way.
I am thirteen years of age. My mother takes in washing, I am an errand-boy; I was out of work; I live with my mother. I was going of an errand for the lodger.
