I sell things in the street . I left my stall, and got a woman to take care of it. A little after seven o'clock, last Monday, there was a quantity of potatoes in a basket. Upon my return, in half an hour, the basket was gone.
The prisoner brought the basket, and pawned it to me, between ten and eleven the same morning, soon after the felony was committed.
I know nothing of it This good woman, when I was going along, much in liquor, stepped out, and said I robbed her of her basket and potatoes. Seeing me in liquor, she wanted to make an advantage of me.
