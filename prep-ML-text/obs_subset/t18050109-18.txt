What is your husband's name?
Edward Chamberlain , a bricklayer; the prisoner is a servant to Mr. Stapleton, I have always bought sand of Mr. Stapleton; the prisoner came with the sand, and delivered it; he came another time with the receipt, I gave him eleven shillings for the load of sand, and he gave me the receipt; I gave him half a guinea in gold and a sixpence; I am positive he is the man I paid the money to.
- I am a coal-merchant and sandman ; a load of sand was sent to Mrs. Chamberlain by her order, this man with another took the load of sand; in consequence of his being in the habit of receiving money, and appropriating it to his own use, he was ordered to receive no more, and this load of sand being on my books, I sent my young man to receive the money; I found Mrs. Chamberlain had paid for it.
When was this that you first found it out?
Three or four days after Christmas-day; after he was detected, I interrogated him; he acknowledged having received it, and not paying it to me, together with several others.
My master trusted me to carry out a dozen bills a little while before; I called on that lady at one time, she was not at home, and then I called again, she paid me the money.
