I work at the India warehouses : On the 29th of June, I was coming down King-street , it poured with rain, and I stopped under a gate-way, and this woman said, you may walk into my room if you please, it is a very honest house, and you will not be robbed; I had not been in the room above five or eight minutes before she got her hand in my pocket, and took out some half-pence, and then she took my watch out of my pocket, and gave it to another woman, who ran away with it; I took the prisoner the next morning in the same room; I have never found my watch again.
I was at Covent-garden from two o'clock till six, and I never saw the man in my life; I am innocent of what he accuses me of.
Were you sober or in liquor at that time?
As sober as I am now.
