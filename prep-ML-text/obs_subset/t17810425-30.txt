My comrade stopped the prisoner; she was standing at this gentleman's back-door; they insisted upon opening her bundle, which was in her lap; they took these stockings out of her lap; the stockings were taken into the linen-draper's shop; I saw them taken from her.
I am the wife of William Layton . The prisoner came into our shop, and bought a pair of stockings for 1 s. 6 d. at about four o'clock on Thursday the 5th of April: she went away, and came again about six o'clock; she then agreed for a pair of white worsted stockings, and another pair; when she came to pay for them, she said, she had not money enough by 7 d. she had a little boy with her; she went out; I looked round, and missed half a dozen pair out of the window; they were tied up in a brown paper, which had my husband's mark upon it.
Should you know it again?
I should: this is the paper; it has the mark upon it.
I am a pawnbroker. I live in Petty-France. I have two pair of stockings, which I took in of the prisoner the 5th of April, between seven and eight o'clock; she told me they were a customer's of mine, that did not chuse to come themselves, and they must be put in in her name, for she was to fetch them out: they are new; they have no mark upon them; but I am quite sure the prisoner is the person who brought them.
I cannot swear to them: I missed two pair of the same sort.
Do you know who these stockings were delivered to in Mr. Warmsley's shop?
No: there were five or six people in the shop.
Who did you get the stockings from?
Justice Durden: I believe he had them from the woman, but not in my presence.
I bought the stockings of a man that sells them in the street.
When did you see the six pair in the window?
I saw them in the window not ten minutes before she came in.
