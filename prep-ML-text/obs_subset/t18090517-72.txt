I am a single woman. I live at Mr. Davis's, Brewer's-lane, Hampstead . I am out of place.
Did you loose a shawl on Saturday the 6th of May
Yes; I left it on the copper, in Mr. Davis's warehouse; I saw it about half after ten o'clock. On the Sunday morning I got up about seven o'clock, I enquired for the shawl, I could not find it. I saw my shawl on the Wednesday following in the hands of the constable; I knew it to be mine. The prisoner lived next door but one.
I am the daughter of Mr. Davis.
Do you recollect seeing Mary George 's shawl
Yes; on Saturday evening she went to bed with me, I know it was safe on the copper when I went to bed; I got up between six and seven in the morning, before Mary George ; I was going out to work, the shawl was safe when I came down; I took the rest of the things and hung them out; I left the shawl on the copper, it was ready for ironing.
Did you see the prisoner that morning
I did not; I came home about twelve o'clock to my children, then the shawl was gone; I told her I had left it on the copper. We made enquiry for the shawl, the prisoner said I have not got the shawl, I have sold it, and spent the money in gin.
I live at West End, near Hampstead. On Sunday evening the 7th of May, the prisoner came to my house with a shawl, and asked me to let her have one shilling and six-pence for it, for the girl that did live at the public house wanted bread; she said that she did not thieve it; Mary George had lived at the George at Hampstead, she told me; I bought it for one shilling and six-pence. Last Wednesday I gave it to Mr. Read the constable.
I am a constable, I got the shawl from this woman.
On Sunday three weeks, I was going to fetch some water, and on my coming behind the pump, I saw the shawl laid in the lane, I picked it up, not knowing who it belonged to, I sold it for one shilling and six pence.
