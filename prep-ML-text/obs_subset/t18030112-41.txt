I am a labouring man: On Tuesday the 7th of December, about a quarter past four in the afternoon, going through Broad-street, Bloomsbury , I was looking at some hats in Mr. Spybey's window; there were some hats hanging at the door-post outside, the prisoner took one of them, and I thought he was going into the shop with it, till I saw him put it under his left arm, and run off; I saw a woman in the shop, and give her notice of it; she then called James; James Tapperell then came across the shop to me, and I pointed out the prisoner; I saw him turn up a passage on the right hand side; we went after him, and when we got to the passage, the prisoner was concealing the hat under his coat; I immediately said, that is the man; the prisoner then took it from under his arm, the man took hold of it, and said, it was his master's property. We then took the prisoner back to the shop, and sent for a constable, and he was taken to the watch-house.
I live with Mr. Spybey, Broad-street, Bloomsbury: I received information from Newton, in consequence of which I went up a passage about six doors from our shop, and found the prisoner with a hat under his coat, he was standing making water, he had a great coat on; I took the hat from him, and brought him back to the shop; he said, a man had given him two shillings to hold it; Mr. Spybey then gave charge of him. This is the hat.
There was a great noise, and a cry of stop thief; I was stopping to make water, and a man running by threw a hat up the passage; I picked it up, and gave it to these two men, and then they laid hold of me.
