I was at work at the Bank; the prisoner was employed by Mr. Poynder; in consequence of suspicion I watched him in the afternoon; he always left work about half an hour before the rest; he always had a basket with some shavings; Smith, the constable, was with me; we stopped him in Lothbury, and found about 3lb. of lead in his left-hand coatpocket; he made a great deal of resistance.
I searched the prisoner, and found the lead upon him; it was quite warm, just come out of the ladle; he said, he had forgot to put it out of his pocket.
It was the bottoms of the ladle, and the foreman desired me to save it till the morning, and I forgot to put it out of my pocket.
