I am a butcher in Hatton-wall ; I know nothing of the loss.
I am a baker in Portpool-lane: Last Friday was a week I was going home, within twenty yards of the prosecutor's house, I saw the prisoner with the left hand under his coat take a piece of beef off, and walk away with it; I called to the prosecutor immediately, and informed him of it; it was about one o'clock in the day; the prisoner turned the corner of a short street, and the prosecutor went after him, and brought him back; I was going after him, and found the beef lying upon the stones in the street; it was the rump and chump.
I am a music-master; I saw the prisoner last Friday week lay his coat over a piece of beef, and walk away with it, in Hatton-wall; I am sure the prisoner is the man.
I leave it to the mercy of the Court.
