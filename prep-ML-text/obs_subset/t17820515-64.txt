On the 23d of April, about five or six o'clock, I came home; I found my wife had seized the prisoner by the collar, coming out of the chamber; we got him down stairs, and secured him. I went up stairs; I saw a coat and waistcoat of my son's lying on the top of the stairs, which had been taken out of a box; and there were three picklock keys.
I went and met the prisoner about half way up the stairs. He had taken the padlock off the back-door to get in. I seized him on the stairs.
I was ordered to go to this house to enquire for a particular person; I went into the house; I could not make any body hear; I went up stairs; these people met me, and said I wanted to rob the house. I am as innocent as the child unborn.
