I am foreman to Messers. Holmes: I can only prove the property.
I am a labourer to Messers. Holmes , No. 109, Long-acre : The prisoner was a stranger to me; I saw the prisoner in the shop with his hand upon the hammer-cloth, he begged my pardon, and went out again; in the course of ten minutes I saw the prisoner return again; he saw me in the shop, and made a short return back; in the course of five minutes I saw him come again into the shop, take the hammer-cloth upon his shoulders, and go away with it; I saw him go across into James-street, and I took him with it upon his shoulder. (Produces it).
This is Mr. Holmes's property.
I am an old man; I was totally in distress, and had not had a mouthful for two days preceding, nor my wife, nor children; if your Lordship will shew me a little lenity, and give me an opportunity of returning to the paths of virtue and honestly, I will ever pray.
