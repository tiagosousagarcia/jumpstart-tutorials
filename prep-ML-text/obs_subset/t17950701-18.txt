I live in Bell-alley, Wapping ; I am a victualler , I lost the table spoon out of my servant's room, I missed them prior to the 18th of June.
How do you know it was in your servant's room?
Because she said so. There was a blanket missing also, but that was in another room, I see that myself, and missed it.
Have you ever seen them again?
Certainly I have, at the broker's, where they were carried to; I cannot say that I see the prisoner take them.
I know the spoon was in my room, and I missed it the 18th of June.
You are servant to the last witness?
Yes.
When did you see it last in your room?
About a week or ten days before I missed it. The blanket I missed the Saturday following, in the same week; the blanket was there on Friday; the prisoner was quartered in the house at the time; we suspected him.
I am a pawnbroker's servant, to Mr. Arther, King-street, Tower-hill; a soldier, of the name of Bridges brought the spoon to us, he asked me if I could lend two shillings on it?
He pawned it, did he?
He did, the officer has got it.
Information was lodged at Shadwell, of a robbery, at Mr. Sibley's house, and I went down and took the prisoner to the office, and he had a hearing, and I said to him, you had better tell where the things are, and perhaps it might clear you; and he told me that he had offered the spoon to pledge at a pawnbroker's near Towerhill, and the blanket he had sold to a man in Rag-fair; I went along with Mr. Sibley to different pawnbrokers, and accordingly I came to King-street, near Rosemary-lane, and I asked the question there, and they shewed me the spoon, and the young woman knew it by a scratch mark that was on it. (Produced.) I searched him to find duplicates, but I found nothing but this screw driver, which I was informed he opened the box with.
To Hawes. Do you know the person of Bridges?
Yes, it was not the prisoner.
To Smith. Was Bridges quartered in your house?
No, I have seen him with the prisoner.
