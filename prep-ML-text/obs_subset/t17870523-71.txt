I live on the west side of Fleet-market ; on Monday, the 7th of May, about seven o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came into my shop; there were six or seven people in the shop; we have two counters, one on the right hand, and one on the left; there were two buttocks of beef, and two hams, on the left-hand counter; I saw him take the buttock of beef out of the dish; I pursued him, and he dropped the beef in the road, and he made to the foot-way, and I took him.
What is the value of the beef?
Twelve shillings.
I was going past the door when he came out of the door with the beef in his hand; I saw him drop the beef, and I saw him taken; I took the beef back to the shop.
I had been out of work some time, and almost starved, and had had a little beer, which made me more hungry than I was before.
