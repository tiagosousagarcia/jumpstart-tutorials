I am an assistant in the day time to the nurse of one of the wards of St. Bartholomew's Hospital ; the prisoner was there as a night nurse in the beginning of July. About five in the morning she went round the ward and asked the people if they wanted any thing; she found none awake but me. I asked her what it was o'clock, she said it was not five. I lay down again and went to sleep; I waked about half past five and missed the prisoner out of the ward; I got up and went to a locker to look for the things I had pulled off after dinner on Sunday; I found it empty; I missed all the things mentioned in the indictment (repeating them) some were taken off a table. When I was sent for to give charge of the prisoner, the instant she saw me she voluntarily confessed taking the things, and begged I would be merciful to her; she said she had pledged them and I should have them again; but she would never tell where she had pawned them. I have never got the things.
I have known the prisoner about five years. I was informed she had robbed a patient in the hospital; she came into my room, I charged her with it, and she acknowledged it directly; I stopped her and sent for the prosecutrix; when she came the prisoner went down on her knees and begged her to be merciful to her.
I know nothing of the things but only a coloured apron she lent me; as to the charge I am innocent.
