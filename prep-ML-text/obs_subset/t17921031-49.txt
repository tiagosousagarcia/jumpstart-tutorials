I am one of the elders of the warehouse for private trade in the India House; from some information I had received, when I was going to lock up, I called the prisoner into the private counting-house and told him he was accused of stealing some indigo, I hoped it was not so; I searched him and found about five ounces of indigo in his breeches pocket; he begged to be forgiven, and said it was the first time; his breeches seemed died through.
I saw the prisoner searched, and in his left-hand breeches pocket was this indigo.
I saw the prisoner take the indigo out of the chest; I am a labourer in the warehouses; I gave the information to Mr. Parry.
