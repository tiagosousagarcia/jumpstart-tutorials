I live with Mr. Brown, a pawn-broker in the Strand; I have a great coat, which I took in on the 10th of July, of the prisoner; he said it was his own property; I did not know him before he pledged it
for 4 s. it was in the course of the afternoon; this is the great coat.
I am a carpenter, at No. 1, Burleigh-Court, in the Strand; the prisoner came and lodged with me two or three nights, in the same room, and I lost a coat and a pair of shoes; I traced this coat, and found where it was pledged; I know it by a hole burned in one of the skirts very soon after I had it, and one of the cuffs is torn off; I saw it on Saturday the 8th of July; I missed it on Tuesday following; the prisoner had left my lodgings.
I have not a friend in the world that will appear to my character, therefore I have only to leave it to the mercy of the Court.
