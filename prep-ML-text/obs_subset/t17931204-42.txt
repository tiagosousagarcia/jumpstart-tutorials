I was a widow when I was robbed.
Did you let lodgings at that time?
I did, I let a room to this woman at half a crown a week.
Did you let any furniture with it?
I let it to her at half a crown a week ready furnished.
When was it?
It was a twelve-month past.
When did you first miss your things?
She lodged with me a fortnight, and paid me in the middle of the next week, Wednesday week, and I made a dish of tea, and she said she was going up to bed, and I never saw her after, I did not see her for two days, nor could hear nothing of her, I said to the woman that is with me, will you be so kind as to put your hand through the paper and see if she is there, she went up and said there was nobody in the room but a good many feathers scattered about the room; O! my God, says I, how can that be when it is a new tick, with that I went up stairs and I saw I was robbed; with that the neighbours came in and they saw the bed was gone.
Did you lose a bed tick?
I did, she took the bed tick and some of the feathers, one blanket, one sheet, a counterpane and the key of the door.
Have you ever found any of your things since?
No, nor I never could find her till I saw her in Bow-street taken by a parcel of mob who had her in custody; this is I think about three weeks.
So that no part of your property has never been found?
No, I never found her or the property.
You never heard her say any thing about your things?
I asked her about my things when I saw her in Bow-street; she said she knew nothing of me.
I know Mrs. Duggan, I lived in her house the same time.
Did you go up and see the things were missing?
I did.
Have any of the things ever been found?
Nothing has been found since.

Was you in the same house?
Yes.
Did you go up and see the things missing?
Yes.
You never heard the prisoner say any thing about them?
