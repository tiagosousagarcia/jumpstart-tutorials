You are the proprietor of stages at Hayes
Yes.
Who was your horsekeeper there at that time
His name was James.
I believe the prisoner had been formerly in your service as horsekeeper
He lived with me twelve years ago.
Did you send down to your horsekeeper oats and beans for your stage horses
I did; I have a sample here; they are a heavy sample of Irish oats and beans, which are of a particular quality. It is my practice with my coachmen to serve out half a bushel of oats and beans for the day; they are put down together and turned up with a shovel.
Upon this man being apprehended has your horsekeeper absconded
Yes; I have made enquiries after him; I have not heard any thing of him.
I live at the Angel at Hayes.
On the 28th of October last did you find any bag with oats and beans in it
Yes, under a bench, behind a tree, about five or six yards from the stables; as soon as I found them I carried them into Mr. Holt's house: he keeps the Angel.
Was the prisoner there at the time
He was, but I did not know who they belonged to.
Did you give the bag with the beans and oats to Mr. Holt
I did not, I set them down in the house and went out to my horses directly; I put them down in the presence of Mr. Holt.
I keep the Angel.
Do you remember the last witness bringing in a bag containing oats and beans
I do.
The bag contained oats and beans
There was about a peck and a half.
Was the prisoner in the house at the time
He was in company with Mr. Fagg's horsekeeper, we called him Jem. The prisoner was making high words with the cook; when this bag was brought in he ceased to be quarrelling; the horsekeeper took up his hat and lanthorn and went home. The prisoner sat silent a little, then he took the bag and went home.
Did Mr. Fagg's man lodge in your house
No; in the neighbourhood. I asked the prisoner at the door how he came by that corn; he said he had got it at Uxbridge; I said I should like to see a sample; he said nothing, but went on homewards; I followed him, I went to his door, I called halloa; the prisoner came out; I said I was not satisfied respecting the corn, and insisted upon seeing some of it; I asked him where the bag was; he said the bag was within doors, but the corn was in the stable, the horse was eating of it. He conducted me to the stable; I went up to the manger and took out, with his leave, some handfuls of the corn; I then came home with the corn; it was oats and beans mixed, I have got a sample of the corn that I took out of the bag that night; the prisoner followed me and asked me what I hurried for; I said I have got what I wanted and I thought I should soon have him. The constable has the sample that I took from the prisoner.
How soon afterwards was the prisoner taken up
When I returned home I sat down in my own room; the prisoner came in and sat down; he went out; I judged he was gone to the horsekeeper; I went to the horsekeeper's room, he was gone out; it was about nine o'clock. I went to the magistrate to advise with him what was best to do. The prisoner was apprehended that night; I went to the horsekeeper; he gave me the key; I brought him to my house; he went away before I could get a constable.
Was the prisoner's examination taken in writing
It was not, I believe. The prisoner said that he got them from Mr. Fagg's horsekeeper out of the bin; he said the horsekeeper owed him two shillings; he called upon him for two shillings in order to buy corn for his horse; the horsekeeper said I cannot pay you, I will give you some corn out of the bin; he said that was the only time he had ever had corn of the horsekeeper; he knew those that had it.
Was what the prisoner said taken in writing
It was not. I produce the oats and beans.
You were before the magistrate
I was; he said the horsekeeper owed him two shillings, he went to him to ask him for it, he wanted some money to buy corn for his horse; the horsekeeper's cry was, he had no money; he gave him this corn.
Do they appear to be the same corn as Mr. Fagg's corn, so far as you can speak to your knowledge
I believe them to be samples of the same corn.
They are precisely the same sort of corn.
What would be the value of these oats and beans
The beans about two shillings, and the oats about one, rather more than less.
The justice wanted me to confess, and almost urged me to say it; they said they would quit me if I would tell the truth; by their urging of me I said I had them of the horsekeeper
