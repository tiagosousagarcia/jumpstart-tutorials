I know nothing of the loss.
This cloak was purchased for me by Mrs. Wessen; I had been out; I came home, and pulled off my cloak, I laid it on the back of a chair; I missed it; and having seen the prisoner come in to sell cakes and gingerbread, I suspected her; I followed her, and found the cloak upon her; I went to Mr. Wessen, and he sent for a constable.
I sold the cloak to Mrs. Wessen; I know this to be the same cloak.
I am an officer; On the 13th of November the prisoner came to the office for a warrant for Mary Webb , for taking a cloak from her; on the 14th I learned that Mary Webb had lost the cloak first, and on the 15th I apprehended her.
This cloak is mine; it was bought not for Mary Webb alone, but for any servant that might live with us to carry out beer in bad weather.
Suppose she had left your service, must she have left it behind her?
Yes.
It was quite a wet evening, and I had had a little beer too much; if I took it at all, it was by mistake, I do not know that I did; my husband is in the guards in Ireland, and I have three small children.
