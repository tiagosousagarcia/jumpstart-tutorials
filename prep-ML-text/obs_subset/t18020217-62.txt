On the 23d of January, I lost a cloak, gown, and petticoat, from my room; the prisoner lodged in the same house; I missed them between ten and eleven o'clock in the evening, and she was taken up with the cloak on her back; the petticoat and gown were pawned, and the tickets found in her pocket.
What do you do for a living?
I go to service.
How long have you been in town?
I came on the 9th of October.
Have you been in service yet?
No, I have been nursing a woman.
Do you never pledge your articles yourself?
No.
Or desired any body else to do it?
No, I had no occasion.
I am a pawnbroker, in Bridges-street, Covent-garden, about five minutes walk from where the prosecutrix lives; I produce a gown and petticoat pledged by the prisoner, about six o'clock in the evening of the 23d of January, for half a guinea.
I am a constable; the prisoner was brought to the watch house a little before twelve by the prosecutrix and watchmen; I searched her, and found his cloak on her back, and the duplicates of the gown and petticoat in her pocket; there was also a few halfpence; I asked her what she had done with the money; she said she had spent it.(The articles produced, and identified by the prosecutrix.)
I leave my defence to my Counsel.
