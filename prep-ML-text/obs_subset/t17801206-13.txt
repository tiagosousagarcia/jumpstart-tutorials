I am chaiseman to his Majesty. I lost a pair of shoes and silver shoe-buckles, on the 7th of November. I went out in my boots and left my shoes and buckles in the coachhouse. Towards the evening I went to look for them, and missed them. I used to employ the prisoner occasionally to help me; he not coming that evening, I had a suspicion of him. I went to look for him two days, but could not find him. On the next Tuesday I got a constable and took him, and had him to the round-house. He confessed he had taken my shoes and buckles, and said he had lost one of the buckles, and sold the other.
Did you make him any promise to induce him to make that confession?
I said I would not hurt him. He had my shoes on his feet when I took him.
Could you have known those shoes if you had seen them any where else?
There is no particular mark; I know them by the shape of my foot and my own judgement.
Have you ev er found the buckles?
No.
Are you sure these were your shoes?
Yes.
I bought the shoes of a Jew going along the Mews.
