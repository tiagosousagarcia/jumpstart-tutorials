I am a printer ; I live in Piccadilly ; I only prove the property.
I am a servant of Mr. Reynell: on the 18th of January I missed a quantity of type; I waited in a room till the prisoner went from work; I suspected him: after he went from work, I went up stairs, and missed three pieces of printing type; I followed the prisoner into Coventry-street; I told him to come back to the office; and as he went up the steps, I felt his pocket, and he took the type out of his pocket. (Produced, and Reynell deposes to the types.) I marked them, before they were stolen, with a figure of six; I am sure they are Mr. Reynell's property: we asked him if he knew of any more; he said he stole 12 lb. more, and said poverty induced him to do so.
My Lord, Mr. Reynell promised me he would not hurt me if I would confess; I did then tell him of a little more. My Lord, I have a very large family, and have had the palsy several times: I have been in gaol six weeks, and nothing but the bare boards to sleep on, and the gaol allowance.
