I am a watchman in Great Russel-street, St. Giles's: I was crying two o'clock in the morning, when I met the prisoner with a bundle; I asked her what was there; she said, her own things; I took her to the watch-house, but going along, she offered me things to let her go.
I keep the watch-house in St. Giles's; this bundle was in her apron.
- I am a cheesemonger : A fire broke out, and in endeavouring to get my things away, they were taken away.
I was at the fire, and a woman with a child asked me to hold the bundle; I could not find her afterwards.
