I keep a house in Marybone . On the 11th of June last, the things mentioned in the indictment, were stolen out of my house; I went out at eleven o'clock in the forenoon; I returned at about half after eight o'clock. When I went out, the things mentioned in the indictment were in the parlor, locked up; when I came home, I found five locks broke open, and I missed the wearing apparel mentioned in the indictment, from the places where the locks had been broke.
I was in company with Mr. Redgrave. I met the prisoner in Turnmill-street, on the 12th of June, between the hours of eight and nine o'clock in the morning; I saw him come out of a house which lay under a suspicion of receiving stolen goods, with a bundle; I stopped him, and in the bundle I found this wearing apparel
I am innocent of what they charge me with.
