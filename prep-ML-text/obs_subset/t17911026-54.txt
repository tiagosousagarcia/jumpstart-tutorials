I live in East Smithfield , I sell things in the street ; I was robbed the 28th of September, of the things in the indictment, they were in my house, I had just sprinkled them down; I was not gone ten minutes, I left her and the things together. When I returned they were gone, and the prisoner; I took in the prisoner the Sunday before as a stranger, and this was Friday, it was all my clothes; she was taken that day week, she owned only to one apron and an handkerchief.
I took the prisoner into custody on the day week after the robbery; she had nothing about her, she said she took nothing but an apron and a handkerchief, and had lost them.
The house is an open house for every body to come in, loose men and loose women; the things were gone while I went of an errand.
