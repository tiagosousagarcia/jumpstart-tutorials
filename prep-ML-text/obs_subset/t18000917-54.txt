I keep the White-horse-inn, in Friday-street : On Wednesday the 23d of July, the prisoner came to my house, ordered a supper, and a bottle of port; he asked for a bed, and came down in the morning about half past nine o'clock.
Did he pay for his bed?
He did, one shilling; he said, he wished the bed to be kept for him, for he should be back that night; he then went away, and in about twenty minutes the sheets were missing; I saw the sheets again at Guildhall on the 25th, and I saw the prisoner the same day, before I saw the sheets; they had my mark upon them.
I am a pawnbroker's servant, (produces a pair of sheets) I took them in of the prisoner at the bar, on the 24th of July last; I knew him by sight some years ago.
I am a constable: I apprehended the prisoner on the 25th upon another charge; when I searched him, I found in his breeches four duplicates, one of which applied to this property.
those are my sheets, they have my mark upon them.
I have nothing to say.
