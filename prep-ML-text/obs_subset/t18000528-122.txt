I am a working-jeweller : On Thursday evening, either the 29th of 30th of May, I stopped in Parliament street , to make water; the prisoner came behind me, and wanted me to go with her; I told her I was a married man, and would have nothing to do with her; she then thrust her hand into my right-hand waistcoat-pocket, and took out three half-crown-pieces; I immediately took hold of her arm, I desired her to give me the property she had taken from me; she said she had nothing of the kind; I said I was confident she had, and I would get a watchman; she seemed not to care for what I said, but endeavoured to get away from me; I got a watchman and gave charge of her; she was searched, and three half-crowns found upon her, but I cannot swear to them; I was perfectly sober, I had not been drinking at all; I had seen my money about two hours before.
I was constable of the night, the prisoner was brought to the watch-house; the prosecutor was quite sober; I shook the prisoner's clothes, and three half-crown-pieces fell from her.
I believe this to be my property.
This gentleman met me at Charing-cross, he was with me up a passage a quarter of an hour, and when he had done, he gave me three-pence; half an hour after that, he came to me and charged me with robbing him; the three half-crowns a gentleman gave me that I had been to see at Temple-bar, I told the constable so.
