I am a statuary ; I live at Knightsbridge ; the prisoner was my servant . On the 2nd of May, about eight or nine o'clock in the morning, I went to my cottage; the prisoner was standing in the stable, he said, sir, somebody has stole the lead work; I went to look and stopped there a few minutes; the prisoner locked the stable door and went away; I had a suspicion that he stole the lead; he drove my horse and cart, and slept in the stable, he had the care of it entirely; I got a ladder erected, a bricklayer got in the window, he found the lead under some hay; I desired him to come out and take the ladder away; I immediately went to Butterworth, the runner, and desired him to come with me to see for the prisoner; I found him in a public house, I desired him to come out I wanted to speak with him; as he was coming from the public house I asked him it he knew any thing of the leaden pipe; he answered no; I desired him to come to the stable; he unlocked the door; we all three went into the hay lost; Butterworth took a truss of hay from where the pipe laid underneath. The prisoner then said he was very sorry, he hoped I would forgive him. This lead was taken from a cottage that I left to Mr. Kingston; the stable is close to the house; it is a leaden pipe, about forty feet.
I am a Bow-street patrol; Mr. Blower came to me on the 2nd of May, about ten o'clock in the morning, he said he had lost a quantity of lead; we found the prisoner at the Red-lion public house at breakfast. When I found the lead in the hay lost, the prisoner said he was sorry for it; he said he was drunk when he did it, or else he should never have thought of doing it.
I know nothing of it. I was out the over night, and the key was out side of the door. I was intoxicated when I was at the office.
