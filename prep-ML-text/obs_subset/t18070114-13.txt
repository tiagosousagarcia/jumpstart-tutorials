I am a stationer , I live in Queen street, Cheapside.
Have you any partners .
Yes, William Heath , and William Thomas Heath . Early in the begining of December, we discovered that some persons had taken the liberty to take money out of our till.
Was the prisoner a servant to you.
He was a porter , he had been three years in our service I believe; in order to lead to detection, on the 12th of December I took copper money to the\\ amountof three shillings and six pence; I marked it and put it in the till, I locked the till, and took particular notice to see that the bolt was up; this was between the hours of eight and nine o'clock in the morning, I unlocked the till between the hours of eight and nine o'clock, and found to the\\ amountof two shillings taken out. On discovering the loss, I got an officer and took the prisoner into custody; upon searching him we found on his person one and two pence halfpenny, the principal part of my own marking. I marked them with my own initials on the Britannia side under the hand.
Had there been no change given that morning.
No, I had the key in my pocket. I apprehend he lifted up the counter and took out the till.
I am a constable, I searched the prisoner, I found in his waistcoat pocket one and tenpence halfpenny.
