I live in Worship-street, Moorfields . On the 29th of July I lost the goods mentioned in the indictment (repeating them) out of my house; the prisoner was my servant ; she was left in care of the house; she left the house on the 29th of July; these things were all in the house when we left it on the 30th of May. I went home on the 31st of July, and then I found the drawers all open and these things gone; I found part of them again at Mr. Davidson's, a pawnbroker, at London Wall, and some more at another pawnbroker's, at the corner of Golden-lane. The pawnbrokers gave up the goods, and I delivered them to the constable.
I live with Mr. Davidson, a pawnbroker, I took these things in pawn from the prisoner, I believe it was in the month of June; they were brought at different times.
I have nothing to say in my defence.
