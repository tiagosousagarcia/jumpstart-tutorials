I saw the prisoner take this sack of malt from the warehouse of my master, on the 23d of April, between three and four; it was pitched on a sack of flour; I was laid in ambush; I took him with the malt on his back.
I heard my man call out stop thief; I saw the prisoner brought back with the sack of malt.
I have nothing to say.
