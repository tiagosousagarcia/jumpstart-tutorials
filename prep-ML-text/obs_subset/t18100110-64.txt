My husband's name is John William Trout , he is a gunner on board a ship ; I live in Checquer-court, St. Catherine's-lane .
Did you lose a pair of stockings and a one pound note from your house
Yes; I missed the pound note on Christmas day, the note was in my chest. The prisoner was my servant , she lived three months with me. I gave her the key of my chest to put my silver milk pot in the chest.
Did you miss any stockings
No. When the prisoner was taken up some duplicates were found on her, among which was a pair of stockings of mine.
Did you ever find your one pound note again
No.
When you took her up did not you tell her it would be better for her to own it
I did.
Then I must not hear a word of what she said.
I am shopman to Mr. Watts, pawnbroker, 89, Upper East Smithfield. I know the prisoner as a customer using the shop, but not as the person that pledged the stockings; I took the stockings in on the 1st of December, I gave the party that pawned them that duplicate.
I apprehended the prisoner; I found on her a duplicate of a pair of stockings pawned in the name of Jane Smith . The prisoner owned she took the one pound note.
When she took me up she told me if I would own to the note and pay her five shillings a week she would not hurt me. I am a poor unfortunate woman.
