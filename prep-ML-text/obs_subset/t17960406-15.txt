I am in partnership with John Cook : On Monday morning, the 7th of March, about a quarter before eight,(on Friday the 4th, a gentleman called upon me, and asked me if I had been robbed by any body belonging to me; I told him, not to my knowledge); I have a warehouse in Milk-street , Cheapside ; I watched and discovered the prisoner coming into the warehouse to light the fire; about two minutes afterwards the constable brought her into the warehouse, and detected her with three dozen of gloves in her apron,(the gloves were produced in Court).
These are my gloves; I know them from the particular make and the shape of them; they are inserior gloves to be sold cheap; this paper of gloves was shewn to me three or four days prior to that, by our head warehouseman; and looking at them in a particular manner, I can swear they are the same gloves; there is the private mark of my warehouseman upon them, I know his hand-writing.
I am a constable: Mr. Price desired me to look out after the prisoner: On Monday morning I saw the prisoner, when the porter opened the shop, go in and bring out a candlestick; while the porter was opening the shutters, she then went down to the Swan-with-Two Necks tap, in Lad-lane, to light it, and came back to the shop again; she was then, I believe, two or three minutes at most in the shop; she came out, and then I followed her, and I touched her upon the arm, and asked her what she had got there, and took this bundle of gloves out of her apron; it has been in my possession ever since.
I am warehouseman at Price and Cook's; I saw the constable take the bundle of gloves out of the prisoner's apron; I know the gloves to be ours; they are inferior gloves, to be sold cheap, and I can swear to the private mark.
He knows very well that I had been up and down in the house, and made use of the waste paper to light the fire with, and this was amongst the waste paper.
