Was the prisoner at the bar a servant of your's?
Yes, she came into my service on the 7th of December; I live at No. 11, Gibraltar-row, Bethnal-green ; about six o'clock in the evening she called up to me and my wife, and told us she was going for a couple of pails of water; she never returned; we found her on Monday last in Noble-street, St. Luke's; I gave her in charge of the officer, and took her to Worship-street; I stated to the Magistrate what I took her for, that she had taken the things I had charged her with; she had got my wife's shift and cap on, and a pair of black stockings of mine; she had the duplicate of the cloak in her pocket, which she delivered to the officer, Goldsmith.
On the prisoner leaving your service, did you search about to see if any thing was missing?
As soon as I came out of the shop, and entered my dwelling room, I missed my dish full of clothes that she had ready for ironing; I missed my cloak, my husband's stockings, and two handkerchiefs, that were not in the wash; there were two children's skirts, a coloured apron, and my children's stockings, and a handkerchief that was in the wash, one cap, and two pails.
I am a constable: I produce the property, and a duplicate of a cloak.
I am shopman to Mr. Jehu Briggs; I produce a cloak pledged on the 10th of December; I cannot say it was the prisoner.
I am a servant to David Windsor ; I produce a coloured apron, and a pair of hose, pledged for half-a-crown on the 7th of December; I took them in of the prisoner, to the best of my recollection, I am not quite sure.
I am a pawnbroker; I produce a child's shift pledged on the 6th of December by Ann Frost , of Noble-street; I do not know her person.
I am a pawnbroker, I live on Fish-street-hill; I have a frock and two children's shirts pledged on the 7th of December; I cannot swear positively to the prisoner.
I was in distress when I took them, and hope you will have mercy on me.
