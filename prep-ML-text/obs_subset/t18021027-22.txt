I am foreman at the warehouse, No. 8, in the West-dock: On the 11th of October last, the prisoner was employed as a lumper , on board the ship Alexander ; she was lying right abreast of the warehouse; I went on board, about four o'clock in the afternoon, in consequence of suspicion; I saw the prisoner on board; I began to search some of the labourers, and while I was searching one of them, I observed the prisoner at the bar run forward on the forecastle, and throw from his person a bag, which I afterwards found to contain sugar; he threw it under the heel of the ship's bowsprit; I took it up; it contained about three pounds and a half of raw sugar; I delivered the prisoner and the bag at the Shadwell Police-office.
Was there any sugar of that quality in the ship?
Yes.
Do you know the name of the captain of the ship ?
Peter Wright Gawthrop.
I am Captain of the ship Alexander, the owner s are Alexander Donaldson, George Glenning , William Morgan , and Alexander Macbean .
What I threw down, was a piece of canvas that I had been wiping my hands with, after I had done work.
