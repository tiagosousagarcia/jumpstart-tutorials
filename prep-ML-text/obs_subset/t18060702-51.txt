I am a bricklayer , I live in Queen street, Oxford street; I was passing through St. Giles's; the prisoner accosted me and asked me to give her something to drink, which I did, I then went with her to her room, No. 8, Bembridge street, St. Giles's , we had some conversation, I laid on the bed and went to sleep.
What time of the day was this.
Between seven and eight in the afternoon; when I awoke I found myself in the hands of James Purcell the landlord, and the watchman, they pulled me off the bed and threatened to send me to the watchhouse, but in consequence of my good behaviour they did not, I told them I was robbed and I should know the woman again if I saw her.
Were you sober.
I cannot say I was, I knew what I had been doing, and I remember what I had; my watch was found three or four days afterwards in the bed, but the money was never found.
I apprehended the prisoner at the bar on the 26th; on going to Bow street she acknowledged she robbed the man and she had spent the money, and she had took the watch, it was hid in the house somewhere; I searched her room, I shaked the bed, I heard the chain of the watch jingle in the bed where the man said he was with her, I took the watch from out of the tick of the bed, it was amongst the feathers.
He told me he would give me the watch for an ilicit purpose, he having no money, he did not come with any money to me for three nights after he gave it me, and without he gave me some money I did not mean to give it him back again.
