I am a widow, the prisoner lodged with me: On Saturday the 2d of July, I went out between eleven and twelve in the morning, and left the prisoner in the house; I saw the things in the room when I went out; I returned again in the evening, and found the house locked up, and the prisoner gone; she was taken the next day, with my stays, petticoat, and stockings upon her.
The prisoner came to where I worked, about a mile and a half from the prosecutrix's, and I heard of the robbery, and stopped her.
I was with the last witness when he took her, that is all I know.
My husband brought these things to me, and I have never seen him since; I have been here ever since the sessions before last, and had nothing but what the gentlemen of the jail pleased to give me and my babe, I have no friend in the world.
