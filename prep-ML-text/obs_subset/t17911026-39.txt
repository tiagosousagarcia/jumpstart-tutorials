I am a coach-maker , I lost a coach glass on the 8th of October, I saw it a few days before; the prisoner was my servant . The prisoner owned it; he had no promise or threat, he said it was at his lodgings. I sent George Woolgin for it. The prisoner had worked for me nine months.
I wish to know whether there was a frame on the glass?
I am a servant to Mr. Carpenter, I saw the prisoner running towards his lodgings, across Green-street, with a glass under his arm, and a frame on it.
I am certain of it.
