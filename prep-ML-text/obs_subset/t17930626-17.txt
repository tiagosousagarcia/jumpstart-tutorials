I live at No. 2, Baker-street, Westminster , I lost the things in the indictment, they were taken out of the garret, they were hung up to dry, they were hung up in the morning about eight o'clock; my husband saw them there at two o'clock; I don't know what time they were taken; my husband is here; I saw some of them again at Mr. Armstrong's, the corner of Bedford-street, in the Strand; I believe they are here in court now, Mr. Armstrong has brought them; I never see the prisoner before to my knowledge.
I am servant to John Salkut , a pawnbroker, I took these things in the 3d of May, between the hours of eight and nine in the evening; they were brought by the prisoner at the bar.
Did you know her before?
No, I never saw her before, but I am certain she is the person that brought them. (Produced and deposed to.)
How came you to know they were at Salkut's?
I delivered bills early in the morning of the articles we had lost.
I live with the Rev. Mr. Hodam's in Queen-street; I don't know any thing about their being stolen I only know the property, they are my master's goods sent to be washed.
The things were given me by another person, and when the pawnbroker stopped me I begged him to go out of the door to see the other person; he said, no, he had got me in custody, and that was enough for him.
