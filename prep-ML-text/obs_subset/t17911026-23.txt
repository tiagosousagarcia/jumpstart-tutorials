My house was broke open the 23d of this month.
I live at Ware, Herts; the prisoner gave me a breast-buckle about ten o'clock on Tuesday night, about three weeks ago; a man had got her in hold, and she then gave it me.
I am constable of the parish of Ware. Mr. Watkins gave charge of the prisoner; after that he knocked me down because I would not let him take the prisoner away. About six in the morning the prisoner said, she wished I would go to Ann Crow 's, as she had left two silver spoons with her, and a breast-buckle with Hitch.
I received two spoons from the prisoner on Tuesday night; she desired me to be good enough to keep them for her till next day.
I apprehended the prisoner. I did not beat Brown; he beat me. I apprehended her, and took her to a public-house. The prisoner is, I believe, some relation to Lovell.
I saw the windows of the house fast; I did not sleep there.
I saw the window open in the morning.
I married the prisoner's aunt. (Deposes to the table-spoons and breast-buckle.) They are all marked W. A. L. I have had the breast-buckle seven or eight years.
My mother gave the things to me; she lives in Green-street, Enfield; I have nothing to say but I am innocent. I have no witnesses.
