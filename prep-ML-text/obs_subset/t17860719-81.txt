I lost my things on Whitsun-Monday morning, from my own room, at Milbank ; I went out about twelve at night, and I was out all the forenoon; the prisoner slept with me about a-week, when I came home she was gone, and my property, my things were loose in the room; I found the prisoner, a fortnight after, at Walham-green, picking of pease in a field, she ran away when she saw me, she was taken to the round-house; a young man went with me; she did not deny taking the things, she had my gown and petticoat on, and apron and handkerchief, and she had pawned a gown at Brentford for four
shillings she told me, and I found it there; I never found any thing more, she said she had made away with the rest; the pawnbroker is not here.
I live in the same house, I laid over the prisoner and the prosecutor, I laid till seven, we had two keys to the fore door, when I came down stairs, the key that belonged to the prosecutor and the prisoner was thrown under the door, I had not seen the prisoner all day; when the prosecutor came in she went into her bed room, and said her things were gone; the prisoner acknowledged taking the things, and directed where they were, the gown was on her back.
I pawned the gown to get shoes; I have not a friend in the world.
