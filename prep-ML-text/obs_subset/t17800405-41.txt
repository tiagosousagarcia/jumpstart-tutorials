On the 13th of March, about five in the evening, I lost a firkin of butter off Dice quay by the water side. There were sixteen firkins and an half on the quay; I counted them, and went to get some refreshment; when I came back, one of them was gone and the prisoner was in custody.
I saw the prisoner go up St. Dunstan's-hill, with a firkin of butter; I went after him and took him by the collar with a firkin on his shoulder. I had landed thirty firkins of butter at the quay the bottom of St. Dunstan's-hill. I thought it might be mine; I found it was not mine. As I was bringing the prisoner back he threw the firkin of butter down, and attempted to throw it on my toes.
I was coming along the quays, and a man hired me to take it to his house.
