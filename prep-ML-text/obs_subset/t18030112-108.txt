- I am a carpenter and joiner , and lodge at No. 33, Bow-street, Westminster ; I lost my boots on the 27th of December; the prisoner lodged with me eight nights; he heard me tell my landlady I should come for my cloaths on Monday night, which I did, and found my boots were gone; the prisoner came home in liquor, and I had him taken up on suspicion; he confessed he took the boots, and pawned them at Mr. Edwards, a pawnbroker in Clare-street.
You have been paid for the boots?
His father gave me two shillings and sixpence for the pawnbroker.
I am servant to Mr. Edwards, and took in the boots on the 27th of December, but cannot swear to the prisoner; when the officers brought him to the house he said I was the person who took them in.(The boots produced and identified.)
