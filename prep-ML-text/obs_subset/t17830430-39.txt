I am a cart wheeler, and keep a lodging house , I lost the things in the indictment, the prisoner lodged in my house, nobody else dwelt in the house but her and me; we had a warrant, and the constable searched the prisoner's room, and found two duplicates, belonging to a sheet and looking glass, and a white apron; on further examination, the constable said, she must have the other articles which I had lost; her husband run away, she confessed to the Justices where all the articles were; the pawnbrokers are here.
I did pawn the things out of the room being much distressed, my husband obliged me to pawn them, he told me, that some of his friends had lent them him to make some money on.
I will not deceive you, it is my daughter, I am sorry to appear here in this capacity; I wish to relate the circumstance, it is an unhappy, and an unfortunate circumstance, she is a person that
has never patrolled the town, though she is reduced to a skeleton by the practices of a designing man, who I suppose has debauched her and stripped her naked; they lived together, and the man ran away as if he was flying from the face of a serpent: Now this poor girl, it is not clear to me that she is guilty.
If the prisoner was the wife of that man who lived with her; as to all acts of this nature committed by the wife, under the immediate power and compulsion of the husband, the law imputes this to the authority of the husband, and does not impute it to her; so that if it appeared she pawned them by his orders, by his command, you must acquit her; but there is no such proof before you, and you have no means of connecting the man with the fact, but from the general probability, that he who lived in the room with this woman, must have known what she was doing, and if he knew, must have been privy, and if privy, must in all probability be the principal and not her; which is going a great deal upon conjecture, in opposition to the immediate conclusion of her being the person that pawned them.
I let my lodging to this man and woman, these things were in it.
In the same room with her.
Gentlemen, this is a stronger case of probability than the former, and therefore as you thought fit before to impute the offence to the man, of course you will acquit the prisoner of the charge.
