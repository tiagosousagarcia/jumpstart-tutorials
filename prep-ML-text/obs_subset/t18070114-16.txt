I am a broker and auctioneer , I live in Moorfields.
Have you any partner .
Yes, my son Paul Mullet . On the 6th of this month, the prisoner stole the copper from my door; on being taken and brought into my accompting house, he acknowledged that he stole it, and that he was mad for so doing.
I am porter to Mr. Mullett. I was shutting up the shop a little before five, I saw a man stand by the copper, and take and chuck it on the top of his head and walk away with it. I thought the copper was not sold, I asked my young master if any of them had sold that copper to-day, he said no; we pursued the man, and he chucked down the copper; my young master brought back the man, and I brought back the copper.
I did not own that I stole the copper.
