I am a widow, I keep the Falcon-tavern in Fetter-lane : On Thursday the 17th of April, the prisoner came to my house about four o'clock in the afternoon, and ordered a pot of beer, and change for half-a-guinea, for Mr. Barr, of Chifford's-inn; I carried the pot of beer myself, and change for the half-guinea; I gave him ten shillings in silver, and two-pence in copper, and he said, go back again and bring another pot of beer, and then I will give you the half-guinea; I returned with another pot of beer, and went to Mr. Barr's, expecting to find him there, but no such person had been there; upon my returning from Mr. Barr's, I found, under the step of the door, the pot of beer, with about a quarter of a pint drank out of it.
I know nothing at all of the prisoner, he is an utter stranger to me; he made use of my name, I did not send him.
The witness swear very false if she says she lost the pot; I never knew any thing about the pot.
