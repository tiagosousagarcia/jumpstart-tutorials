I live at No. 19, Wellclose street, Wellclose-square , I am a watchman and labourer , at the London Docks. On the 21st of December, about nine in the evening, I heard my daughter call out father several times, I went into the passage and caught the prisoner, she was just going out of the door, my daughter said she had stolen the leaden pipe; the prisoner appeared to be in liquor. The leaden pipe was affixed to the house.
I am daughter to the last witness. Just as I came from work my mother bid me to go in the washhouse for some things that were there, and on my hearing the water run I opened the yard door and saw the prisoner, she bid me let her out; I said to her, you have got the pipe, she said, I have not; I caught hold of her by the gown, followed her into the passage, and called out father; I called my father the second time, then she laid the pipe down, she tried to get away from me, but I held her gown, and by the time she got to the street door my father came and took her. She had broken the pipe off.
I am a constable. I took the woman in custody and the pipe was given to me by Mr. Whitman.
I was going by, and seeing the door open I went in, I saw the child, she told me I was doing wrong, I did not know any thing of it, I told her; no more I did not. I went in there to hide myself from the boys throwing mud at me.
