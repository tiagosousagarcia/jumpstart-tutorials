- I live at No. 30, Sandy's-row, Petticoat-lane , and missed a side of bacon from the door-post; I pursued the prisoner with the bacon, and he dropped it; I know it to be mine; the prisoner said he was not the man.
I was coming out of my own court, and heard the cry of, stop thief; a man run against me, and knocked me down, and as I was getting up, they said I had stolen the bacon.
