I am a printer; on Monday was a fortnight
as I was coming down stairs, I heard a noise; there is a window on the landing place; I turned my head, and saw the prisoner breaking this leaden pipe from the house; I stood to watch him; it was about half past seven in the evening; I then went into the yard, but before I got into the the yard, he took a knife and went into the necessary; I ran to the necessary door, and as I opened the door, he let the pipe fall down; I pulled him out and took him; I never saw him before.
I was going of an errand into Westminster, and coming back, I met a man, who asked me if I had seen a little child which he had lost; I told him no; I waited for him, and I went into the yard, and this man ran out, and running out into the entry, one of these gentlemen ran out, and said, I was breaking his pipe.
