- I am a weaver and watchman ; On the 16th of August, I was coming home between six and seven in the morning, and met the prisoner and two women, I had a little knowledge of him, they went home with me, the women went away; my watch was on the back- room shelf, I went out for half an hour, and when I returned, I missed the watch.
I found the watch at a pawnbroker's, in East-Smithfield.
The prisoner brought the watch and pawned it for fifteen shillings, in the name of Darby Bryant.
I know no more of the watch than the child unborn.
