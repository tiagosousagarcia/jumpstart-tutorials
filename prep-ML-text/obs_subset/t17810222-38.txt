I am the wife of Patrick Bryan . I lost a counterpane on the 30th of January, a little before eight o'clock at night; it was hanging on a horse in the yard to dry. The prisoner lodged in the same house with me; he went through the passage into the yard. I
saw him attempt to take the counterpane off the horse; the horse fell down and broke the window. I had a light in my room; the shutters were not shut, so I could see into the yard, he went back through the passage. I followed him with a candle in my hand and saw the counterpane under his arm in the street. I could not overtake him; he got off with it. About half or three quarters of an hour after I saw him stand talking with his wife at the corner of the street. I sent for a constable. The prisoner said he had not got it. I never found the counterpane again.
I lodged with the prosecutor. I saw the prisoner go through the passage into the yard; he did not stay above a minute before I saw him come back through the passage again with a bundle under his arm. He walked very smart; the woman came from the back room, and followed him, but he went away. He came back again about an hour after.
Did he appear to be drunk or sober?
Sober. A constable was sent for who took charge of the prisoner.
This yard is open to the people of this house and the next. There are four families live in rooms at the upper end; I live in the farthest. I was going into the yard; It was quite dark. I ran against the horse and it fell down and broke the window. Mrs. Bryan called out to know what was the matter? I said I had broke the window. She said if that was all never mind. I went into my room, and staid a quarter of an hour. Then I was going out for something for supper, and she came and said I had got her counterpane. I know nothing of it.
