I lived in Parker's-lane , the prisoner robbed me of all my clothes; I went there on Thursday, I went to sleep with the prisoner, I did not know she was a girl of the town, I never knew her before; another girl that I have not catched, enticed me to this prisoner's lodging, it was about three in the evening, in the afternoon, I paid the landlady of the house three-pence for sleeping there; I lighted on the girl in the street, and asked her for a lodging, and she took me to this lodging; I went to bed when it was getting duskish, at about ten I awakened, and missed my things; I awaked about ten, and found my things gone; the prisoner would not go to bed, but she was in the room, when I awoke; the prisoner never came back, and in the morning I went and told the landlady, and she said I should have taken better care of my things; I lost the things in the indictment, I had nothing left but my shift, and stockings, and cap, an handkerchief, and an old petticoat; I came from Shropshire on Saturday to get a place; I took the prisoner the next morning at the top of Parker's-lane, but I cannot read, she had my cap and ribbon on, and my pocket in her pocket; another girl and a man lodged in the same room with the prisoner, I went from the lodgings only in the morning; two young men at the public-house told me to go to Bow-street, it was as soon as they opened the windows, a woman told me I was got into bad company, but the prisoner and the girl said, I need not take any care of my clothes.
I am a constable; on Saturday, the 3d of September, I was sent for to apprehend the prisoner, this girl was sitting on the bed, and had nothing but her shift and an old green petticoat, and a kind of a ragged shawl; I went into a back room, and the prisoner was there, and the girl said, that in my cap and ribbon, and in the prisoner's pocket was this girl's pocket.
The other girl and a man took my cap away, and gave me this cap and ribbon and pocket, instead, I put it on, I did not know whose it was.
She said they had sold the things for nine shillings, and were gone into Kent.
