I am a watchman, of Portsoken ward. On the 18th of June, I met the prisoner, at the corner of the Minories, opposite Houndsditch, at about half after three o'clock in the morning: she had a pair of sheets, and a counterpane, under her arm: they were open. I asked her where she brought them from. She said, From Mr. Bolton's, at the Golden-Cross, Charing-Cross . She said she found them in the inn.
He speaks very true in what I told him.
I am a constable. On Monday morning, at about half after three, the watchman brought the prisoner to me, with the things. She said she found them in the yard of Mr. Bolton, of the Golden-Cross, Charing-Cross. They desired me to let her go. She said, if they would let her go, she would leave the things behind her. I have had them in my possession ever since.
I am chamberlain to Mr. Bolton. These sheets and counterpane are my master's property: they have his name upon them. We missed them on the 17th, at about a quarter before twelve o'clock at night, cut of the room, No. 23. They were taken from the bed.
On what day did you apprehend the prisoner?
On the 18th.
I keep the Golden-Cross, at Charing-Cross. I know these, by the mark, to be my property.
Was the door locked?
Yes; she had lifted up the window, and taken them out. The bed was close to the window.
How high is the window from the floor of the gallery?
Three quarters of a yard, or a yard.
I am very innocent of stealing the things. As I came through the yard, I saw them rolled together. I took them up, and put them under my arm. I never opened them till the watchman took me.
