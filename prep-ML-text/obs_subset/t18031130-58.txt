I keep a grocer's shop, in Bartholomew-close , near Mr. Pincott's, and am one of the trustees of the parish of St. Bartholomew the Great: On the 2d of September, I, with some other of the trustees and a peace-officer, ordered the beadle to take away a chaise, which was standing opposite Mr. Pincott's house, in the coach-path, to the green-yard; it had stood there from nine or ten o'clock till about four o'clock; chaises were set out every day. When the chaise was taken away, Mrs. Pincott called stop thief; Mr. Pincott followed the man, and most cruelly used him, for which he was summoned before the Alderman. I returned home, and next day I observed a paper stuck up on the front of the defendant's house, with wafers, in a very conspicuous manner. On the 5th of September, I observed a paper stuck up as before, only in larger characters. (A paper shewn him.) This is the paper, and which was taken down by my order; I saw Mrs. Pincott, but not Pincott; his wife principally stood at the door while the paper was up. In consequence of the ill-usage the officer received from Pincott, we attended before the Magistrates. After the 5th of September, I observed a paper pasted within side the chaise-house, and after that it was chalked on a board, and exposed to public view, and attracted a crowd of people round the door.
You are a green-grocer?
No, I keep a grocer's shop.
The defendant is a coach-maker?
He lets out chaises , I don't know that he is a coach-maker, though he writes it up; occasionally chaises come to be repaired.
Don't you know the chaise you ordered to be taken away, was a chaise sent to be washed and repaired?
I do not know it of my own knowledge.
Did you know to whom it belonged?
No.
Had you seen that chaise washed in the course of the day?
I had seen some washed.
It is a sort of bye-place, is it not - there is no thoroughfare for carriages?
There is a thoroughfare for foot-passengers, and a carriage way up to Albion-buildings, but no thoroughfare for carriages.
The street opposite Mr. Pincott's is rather extensive, is it not?
Yes, but a carriage could not pass without going round Mr. Pincott's chaises, sometimes five, six, or seven, of them.
In consequence of a chaise standing there one day, it was drawn away by your order?
Yes.
You had not told the defendant you were going to take it away?
Not that day, but our vestry clerk had; and I went up myself, with some other trustees, a week or ten days before, with the act of parliament, to request Mr. Pincott would take the chaise away, or abide by the consequence.
You did not do so on the day the chaise was taken?
I certainly did not.
You have seen chaises washed there?
Yes, and I have seen them repairing chaises there, painting them, and doing the smith's work there.
I am apprentice to the defendant and his brother-in-law; I lived in his house on the 5th of September last.
Look at that paper, and say whose writing it is?
I cannot say.
Did you ever see Mr. Pincott write?
Yes, I don't believe it is his hand-writing; I cannot tell whose it is; I saw a paper stuck up, but cannot speak to it; this is something like it, but I cannot say, as there were two; I believe this is one; I only read a paper, and did not take any particular notice of it.
Who put it up?
I don't know.
Was the defendant at home when it was put up?
I don't know; he was at home at his meals.
Did you see him standing at the door while the paper was there?
No.
Did you see any body reading the paper?
Yes, a few.
Do you mean to say there were only a few?
I was in and out all day; there might be five or six when I saw them.
You know Mr. May?
Yes.
Does he reside near you?
Yes.
Do you know Mr. Pratt?
Yes.
Does he live near you?
Yes.
Does Mr. Dover, the tailor, live near you?
Yes.
Do you believe them to be the persons spoken of in the paper?
Yes.
Do you know Mr. Senior?
Yes.
Do you know Bishop, a tailor, and Dighton, a chandler?
Yes.
Do you believe they are the persons meant in this paper?
Yes.
Was any person standing at Pincott's door pointing out Mr. May's house?
No.
Did you hear Pincott say any thing about the paper?
No, I am his apprentice, and work out; I am only in his presence at meal times.
Upon your oath, have you never heard him speak of that paper?
Not to my knowledge.
Did you ever hear any body else speak of it in his presence?
Not to my knowledge.
Did you ever ask him how it came to be put up?
No.
You were surprised to see it there?
Yes.
How long did you see it there?
I cannot say; I saw it about ten or eleven o'clock.
Were people looking at it when you went in and out?
Yes.
Did you tell Mr. Pincott somebody had stuck a paper up?
No.
You never asked him about it, or any body in his presence?
No.
That you mean to swear?
Yes.
I am vestry-clerk of the parish of St. Bartholomew the Great: In our books there are the names of Moses May , William Bragg , George Dover , John Dighton , and the others named in the paper, all trustees; they are trustees when they become church-wardens.
I am solicitor to the trustees: On Tuesday, the 6th, the defendant called upon me, and said if Mr. May and the other trustees would return him the twenty shillings, and the other expences he had been at in getting the chaise out, he would not expose them any longer. I told him I was very certain the trustees would not comply with it, but I had no objection to mention it to them; I had possession of the paper at that time.
I am one of the trustees, and saw a paper up at the defendant's, but did not read it; when Pincott was before the Alderman, he said he would keep the paper up a month if he liked.
