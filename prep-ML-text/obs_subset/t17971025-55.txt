I am in partnership with George Seddon , Thomas Seddon, and George Seddon, the younger: We lost the property named in the indictment, from our warehouse in Aldersgate-street ; the prisoner was a servant in the house; on Wednesday last, about eight o'clock in the evening, the prisoner was brought into the accompting-house, and the property found concealed, part of it in his breeches, and part under his waist coat, the brass wires were in his pocket; we missed them from the warehouse.
I am clerk to Messrs. Seddons: On Wednesday evening last, I saw the prisoner take the carpeting and six brass wires from the warehouse, and wrap it round his body; he was taken into the accompting-house, and it was found upon him.
I have the management of the carpet warehouse; I missed from the warehouse the carpeting that was taken from the prisoner; I did not miss the wires.
I can only speak positively to the two yards; I had put it there in the morning.
It is the first time I was ever guilty of such an offence.
