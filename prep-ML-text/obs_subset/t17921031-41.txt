I am a publican ; I live in Tottenham Court Road ; I lost a child's dimity petticoat and pillow-case out of my own club room, about half past ten at night, I found them in the prisoner's pocket directly, up one pair higher, in the room where he lodged; he said they were in a bundle in his room.
I am a constable; I took these things out of the room; I received them from the prosecutor; I have had them ever since.
The bundle was on the table, and I expected a bundle; the things were not in my pocket.
