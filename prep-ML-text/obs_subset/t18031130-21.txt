I am a barrister ; I live in Lincoln's-inn: On the 17th of November, in the fore part of the day, I went home with the prisoner; I put my watch down in the window-seat; after I had been there some time, she went out, and took the advantage of conveying away the watch; I followed her, but lost sight of her; she was stopped with the watch by a pawnbroker, about five hours afterwards, I am sure she is the person.
I am a pawnbroker; the prisoner at the bar offered to pledge the watch at our shop, and I stopped it.
This is my watch.
He was very much in liquor, and gave me the watch to pawn.
(To Mr. Hunt.) Were you perfectly sober?
Yes.
Did you give her any money?
I meant to have given her some if she had not left me.
