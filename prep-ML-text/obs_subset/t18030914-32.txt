I am the wife of James Radford , at Highwood-hill, Barnet; we lodge at a public-house, the Three Crowns : I lost the articles mentioned in the indictment on a Monday morning, I don't know what day of the month; it was in August; I had seen them at nine o'clock in the morning in my master's barn, Mr. Boucher's; I missed them about eleven; I then went to the field where my husband was at work; the prisoner was brought back by Mr. Coxhead, my master's servant, with the property upon him; the articles that were found were of the same sort and quantity that I lost; the bacon belonging to John Hornblow was left in my care; I knew it again, when it was found; I never saw the prisoner before.
I am bailiff to Mr. Boucher: On the 18th of July, the prisoner came to me to enquire for work, we were hay-making; I refused him work; I came out of the park gate, when I observed a person pop down behind a bedge; I called to him, to know what business he had there, for there was no foot-path on that side; I told him to go about his business, and I went into the park; soon after, this woman came, and said, she was robbed; I saddled my horse, and went in pursuit of the prisoner, and found him at the King's Head, about a mile from the barn; he had a bundle upon the table; I insisted upon seeing what was in it, and found the property mentioned in the indictment; he said he had bought them; he went back with me as far as Captain Williams's gates, and shut them; I got in, and he drew a knife; I called for help twice, and some people came and helped to take him; he had the property with him when he was taken.
I assisted in taking the prisoner; he had the property upon him; he was knocked down by an Irishman with the handle of a hay fork.
Here is the knife, (producing it) a man took it out of his hand, and gave it to me.
I told him I would shew him the house where I bought it at Barnet, and he would not go with me.
