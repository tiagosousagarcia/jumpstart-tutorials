I am an attorney.
Do you know this woman
She has been my servant eleven months; she has attempted several times to make away with herself; I have saved her myself from hanging herself and from jumping out of the window.
Is she in any deranged state
Sometimes so and sometimes not so.
You are one of the turnkeys
Yes; ever since the prisoner has been in goal she had been in the same state she is in now; if she was not taken care of by the other women she would tear her things to pieces.
