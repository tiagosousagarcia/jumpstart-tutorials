- I am a farmer , at Twickenham : On the 3d of September, I found a goose hid in some straw, about three yards from a barn, where I afterwards placed myself to watch; I watched from seven o'clock till near twelve, when the prisoner came; it was a moon-light night, I heard a rustling in the straw, I had a gun with me, he took the goose and put it in a bag; I cried out, is that you, Hall, stop; he dropped the bag and ran away; I fired at him low, and hit his leg, but he got away; after he was taken, he was examined by a surgeon, and he found a shot mark; the goose had been killed in the barn. The prisoner had been at work for me some time, I am sure he was the man.
I am the son of the prosecutor: I went by my father's desire to see the prisoner's leg, and there were the marks of six or seven shots in his leg; he said he had had somebody to pick them out.
I was watching with Mr. Lott: I am sure the prisoner is the man, I knew him very well; he has four children.
On the Saturday evening I got too much liquor, my wife came to fetch me home, and I would not go, we had some words and she said she would lock me out; I said, I did not care if she did; I went to lie down in the straw, and then I altered my mind, and thought I would go home, and as I was going away I was fired at.
