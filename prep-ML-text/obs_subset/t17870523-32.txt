I lost a blunderbuss, on Tuesday, the 22d of May; it stood at my door for sale; I live at No. 5, High-street, St. Giles's ; I know nothing of the prisoner.
I heard the cry of stop thief; I ran out of my master's shop, and saw the prisoner running as hard as he could, with a blunderbuss in his hand; I followed him down one street, and down another; then he ran into a public house for shelter; I followed him in, and took him; and the blunderbuss was under the settle.
I am a carman; I stood at the public-house door, and I saw him run by with a blunderbuss; I did not see him take it; in about a minute the mob came after him; he pushed by me into the house; they went in, and there he was seemingly asleep on the settle; they said that was the man; I said, this is the man that brought the blunderbuss in here; and under the settle there was the blunderbuss; it was the George Inn, by the church; the mob came in about a minute after he came into the house.
What age are you?
Thirteen and a half.
Do you know the nature of an oath?
Yes.
What do you think will happen to you, if you swear falsely?
The pillory.
But besides that, do you know the obligations that an oath poses on you to speak the truth? what do you think will become of you, if you take a false oath?
It is a bad thing to take one's neighbour's life away.
What would become of you in the next world, if you was to take a false oath?
Go to hell.
I saw the prisoner take the blunderbuss from the door of Mr. Lane; he ran away with it; I followed him, and saw where he went into.
What coloured coat had he on when he was in the public-house?
He had a white coloured coat on then, and he slipt that off, and hung it under his coat.
I have had no other coat for this year and a half.
