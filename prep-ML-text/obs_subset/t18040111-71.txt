I live at No. 71, Paul-street, Finsbury-square ; I keep an oyster-shop : On the 9th of January, about half past five o'clock, two officers brought the prisoner into my shop, and a tub of oysters; they told me they saw him take the tub of oysters, and walk out with them; I went to Worship-street at seven o'clock the same evening, and claimed my property; the prisoner was committed.
I am an officer: On Monday evening last, about half past five o'clock, me and Ferris were going up Paul-street, I observed the prisoner pass Mr. Noble's shop several times; he reached into the shop, and took off a tub of oysters which stood on a stool in the shop; he then poured the water off before the man's door into the street; he then went round the corner a few yards into Leonard-square; I came up to him, and he was then pouring the remainder of the water from the oysters: Ferris caught hold of him, and then he threw the tub and the oysters down in the street; I picked up the oysters, and put them into the tub, and took them back to Mr. Noble.
I was with Cleave, I saw the prisoner and another man walking past Mr. Noble's house several times; they parted, and then the prisoner went and brought out a tub of oysters; he poured the water off facing the gentleman's door; he then walked a few doors further into Leonard-square; I crossed the way, and apprehended him; he dropped the oysters, and Cleave picked them up; we took him and the oysters back to Mr. Noble's, and desired him to come to the Office at seven o'clock.
