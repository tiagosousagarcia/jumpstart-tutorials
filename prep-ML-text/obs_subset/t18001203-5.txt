- I can only swear to the property.
- I am a butcher: On Wednesday the 24th of September, I saw the prisoner, and two other men, one of them gave an umbrella to the prisoner, and he walked on, the other two stopped behind, and as I was passing those two to go after him, the other two pushed me about, and told me he was gone down a court, till I made an alarm, and then they let me go by them; I went after the prisoner and took the umbrella away from him; he would not let me have it at first, but I told him my master was coming, and then he let me have the umbrella; I took the umbrella, and just as I left him, I met my master, and went back with my master to the man, and he took him.
- My husband is a butcher, No. 13, Duke-street; I had just left the shop, with the umbrella in it; I saw the prisoner come out with the umbrella, I sent the boy after him; Mr. Seabrook came up, I sent him after him, and he brought back the prisoner, but he is not the man that took it out of the shop.
I took the prisoner and the umbrella, which I delivered to Hall, the marshalman.(James Hall, the marshalman, produced the umbrella, which was deposed to by the prosecutor.)
A man gave it me to hold a minute, while he went into a house to ask for some money. GUILTY , aged 60.
