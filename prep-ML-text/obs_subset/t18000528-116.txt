I am proprietor of the Equitable-Office for Servants , the corner of Ely-Place : On the 6th of May, within one door of my own house, I felt something at my pocket; I turned round, and the prisoner had got my silk handkerchief from me; I pursued him immediately, I never lost sight of him till I took him in Bartlett's-buildings, with my handkerchief upon him.
I saw the handkerchief drop from the gentleman, I picked it up and gave it him immediately.
