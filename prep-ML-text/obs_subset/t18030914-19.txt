I lodge in Sweden's passage, Moor-lane, and drive a hackney-coach : I was standing at Moorgate on the ranks, the prisoner asked me to give her some drink, on the 15th of August, about half past ten at night; I did so; I left my coach, and went into a public-house, after drinking the liquor, and she offered to take care of my horses; in the mean time my coat was gone, and she too; I ran after her, and the watchman said she was up a court.
I am a watchman: I met the prisoner with the coat over her arm at half past ten; she said the coachman gave it her to mend, and I let her go; next morning I saw her in Grub-street; she had pawned it; I gave her in charge of a constable.
I am wife of Joseph Roberts: On Monday evening, as I was going on an errand, I met the prisoner with a large bundle in her apron at the corner of Moor-lane; I met my husband looking for his coat.
I am a pawnbroker, No. 1, Crown-street, Finsbury-square: On the 16th of August, this great coat was pledged with me by the prisoner, about nine o'clock in the morning; the prosecutor's wife brought the ticket, and said the coat was stolen. (Produces the coat.)
I took charge of the prisoner; she said the pledged, and gave me the duplicate.
I lived with the prosecutor between three and four years as his wife; I met him, and asked him to give me a trifle, and he gave me the coat to pawn, which I did for seven shillings and sixpence, and gave him the duplicate.
I did not give it her.
