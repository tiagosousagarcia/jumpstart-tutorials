- I was a purser on board the ship Sarah Christiana East Indiaman, laying at Deptford ; when I left the ship to bring the dispatches on the 4th of September, I left the chest in the prisoner's care, who was Captain's steward , to bring on shore, and to deliver it at my father's house, but he did not; I asked him for it in October; he denied it, but said Mr. Moore, the chief mate, had taken it, who told him I had given it to him; I went to Bow-street, and obtained a search-warrant; his lodgings were searched, and the caddy found under his bed; he said it was my caddy, which he had brought from on board ship.
I am Captain of the ship, the prisoner was my steward; it was his business to see my stores on shore; the purser gave the prisoner charge of his stores in my hearing, and I gave him charge on the 6th, but did not see the caddy; I was present when the Bow-street officers found the caddy under the prisoner's bed.
I am a Bow-street officer, and went and searched the prisoner's lodgings, No. 48, Little Bedford-street, Covent-garden, and found the box under the bed; the prisoner was not at home.
I never had any care or charge of them; they were taken on shore by Joseph Gordon , and were found at his lodgings; I was ordered to throw them overboard; Gordon said, he would take them, as they would serve his wife for her caps and ribbons.
