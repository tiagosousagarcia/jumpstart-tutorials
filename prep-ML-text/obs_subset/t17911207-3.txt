I live in Henrietta street ; I am a miniature painter . The prisoner was my servant ; he came to live with me in October last. On Friday the 28th of October Mr. Bond sent to me. I went to the office in Bow-street; I there saw a miniature picture, set in gold, my property. I had not missed this picture before; my pictures were put into a box on account of repairing the house. Mr. Heather stopped the prisoner.
I am servant to Mr. Heather; he is ill, and unable to attend. This young man brought the picture into our shop on the 28th of October. He asked to exchange it for a pin. Mr. Heather thought he did not come honestly by it, and sent for a constable. The prisoner said, a young woman gave it him for a pin. (Produces the picture.) Mr. Heather delivered the picture to me. I am sure this is the picture the prisoner offered.
I am a patrole; I searched the prisoner in Heather's shop, and found a small magnifying glass and a shilling. I went with Mr. Shelley to his house, and searched the prisoner's box, Mr. Shelley was present, I found a shirt and two neck handkerchiefs; they are here.
This picture is my property; it is one of them that was in the box. The shilling I swear to; and think the glass is mine; I had such a one. When I searched, I could not find it. I do not swear to the shirt, but I have no doubt it is mine. The neckcloths I believe also are mine.
I came by the shilling honestly; the magnifying glass I found in sweeping out the pantry; the linen I had from the country; my mother always washed for me.
