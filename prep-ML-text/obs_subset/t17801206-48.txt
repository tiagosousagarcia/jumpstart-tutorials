I lodge at No. 10, Brick-lane . On Wednesday last I went out of my apartment about four o'clock in the afternoon. I returned again in a quarter of an hour. I found my room door open. I locked it when I went out. I went into my room; I saw the prisoner almost by the fire-place. I asked her what she did there? She said, she was come to enquire for a Mrs. Williams, that she had a letter from her husband, who was on board a ship. I told her that was an idle excuse. She had something in her apron. I called down my shop-mate, Thomas Edwards . Then I snatched at her apron, and my coat, waistcoat, and breeches, and a sheet dropped out.
What he has said is as false as God Almighty is true.
I am a constable. I was charged with the prisoner. I found upon her seventeen keys of different sizes, and a chissel, fit to break a door open.
I went to ask for Mrs. Williams. I went up the wrong house by mistake; I found the door open; I came down directly. I never was farther than the door. I never had any of the things. I beg for mercy on account of my condition; I am with child.
