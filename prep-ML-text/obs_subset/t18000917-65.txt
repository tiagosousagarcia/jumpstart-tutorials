I keep a pamphlet-shop , just by St. Luke's Hospital ; the prisoner came in to ask for the history of George Barnwell , and while I was looking for it, she asked me to let her tie her garter up, and I let her go into the back-room, there were two shirts lying in the chair, and when she came out of the room again, I missed my two shirts; seeing a bundle in her apron, I asked her what she had got there, she said, nothing of mine; I told her, I missed a couple of shirts, and I would see what she had in her apron; I pulled her apron open, and saw the tail of the shirt; I asked her what she called that, she said it was a sheet; I told her, I insisted upon seeing it, and she said, it was not decent for me to see it; she said, she would shew it to a woman in the street, and there was a woman sitting upon the boundary stone, she beckoned to her, she passed the woman and got quick round the corner of the alley; a gentleman called after her, I believe, twice, and she came back and threw the shirts on the floor, just where she took them from.
I was passing accidentally, when I saw the woman come out of Layman's house, she passed me to turn down the alley, I asked her what she had got there, she made me no answer, at last she turned back and went towards the house, I followed her; I then stopped her till the old man came back; I asked him if those were his shirts, he said, yes, they were; the woman begged I would not be cruel; an officer came, and she was taken into custody. (The constable produced the property, which was deposed to by the prosecutor.)
I had a dirty sheet in my apron, I did not touch the shirts, they were lying upon the floor.
