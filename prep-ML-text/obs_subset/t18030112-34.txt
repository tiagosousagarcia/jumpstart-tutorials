- I am a servant to Mr. Clarkson, at the Crown and Anchor, Judd-place, Sommers-town : On Monday the 10th of this month, about ten minutes past ten in the morning, I went up stairs to change my linen; I came down again, and left my watch on the bed; I desired the maid-servant, when she made the bed, not to disturb the watch; about two hours after, I went up for it, but did not find it; the prisoner was my fellow- servant ; he was gone to town, and when he came back, about five o'clock, I accused him of taking it, and he denied seeing it; my master and I searched the room again, but did not find it; a man that had been out with the prisoner all day, said, he thought he could tell me where to find it; I went with him to a pawnbroker's, the corner of Shug-lane, where I found my watch.
- I am a pawnbroker (produces a silver watch) I took it in of the prisoner on the 10th of January, in the early part of the day; I don't recollect to have seen him before, but I am sure he is the man; he told me he was out with a horse and cart, and that the cart had done some damage in the street; that it had been taken to the Green-yard, and the expences were 1l. 4s. he did not wish his master to know it, and therefore he pawned the watch.
I am a constable; I searched the prisoner, and found a one-pound note and 7s. 6d. he denied knowing any thing of the watch. - (The watch was identified by the prosecutor.)
The money is my own; I was formerly a jockey, and a gentleman that I used to ride for, being successful for him, gave me the 1l. note some time ago.
