I have lived foreman to Mr. Grimwood, nurseryman , for fourteen years: On Wednesday the 14th of May, after six o'clock, the men locked up their tools within the gate, I was coming to town, and the prisoner walked with me; he told me he had not had a bit of any thing all day; we went to a public-house in Oxford-street , and I took compassion upon him, and gave him a half-crown to get him a supper; he went out, and did not come back till eleven o'clock; it was late, and I said I should like to have a bed; he said, there was a public-house across the way, that the man had broke, and it was empty, we could go over there and stay till day-light, and we went; there was nobody there but him and me, and the maid, she went up to bed; he then desired me to pull out my watch that we might know what time to go; I laid my head down and went to sleep, he was smoking his pipe, and drinking beer; I waked about three o'clock, and the man was gone, and my watch gone; I staid till Friday, thinking the man would bring the watch, but he did not; then I sent the Bow-street and the Marlborough-street people after him, and he was apprehended; I got information that my watch was sold to a Jew, at Chelsea; I had a warrant for the Jew, and he heard of the warrant, and appeared the day after with my watch; I knew it to be mine.
How long had you known the prisoner?
He had worked once or twice in the garden.
What is he?
He is a very good clerk; he is a very good writer; but, I believe, he was starving; and, in short, people that know him give him a very good character.
I am a dealer in clothes: On the 15th of May last, between one and two o'clock in the afternoon, I bought this watch of the prisoner at the bar, with a silver seal, and a broken key to it, he told me it was his own property; I gave him a guinea for it; he wished for the seal back, on account of its having been in the family so long, and I returned him the key and the seal.
I know this to be my watch.
I never saw Benjamin till I saw him at Marlborough-street; he came and looked at me, and said I was not the man.
