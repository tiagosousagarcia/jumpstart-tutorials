The prisoner, whose husband is a sailor, and is at sea, drank tea with my wife; my wife came out, and left her by herself in the room; the watch was hanging by the mantle-piece; it was missed after she went away.
Have you seen the watch since?
I have seen a watch at Mr. Brodie's that is like mine, but I cannot swear positively to it.
I am a pawnbroker. I have known the prisoner and her husband exceeding well these five or six years; she brought me this watch, and said it was her brother's. She has always borne an exceeding good character.
