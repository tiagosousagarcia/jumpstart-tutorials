I live in Cripplegate-buildings, nearly opposite Mr. Tyler's: On the 15th of July, about six o'clock in the evening, I saw the prisoner come out of Mr. Tyler's shop with a tea-urn under each arm, and Mr. Tyler's son running after him; upon that he put down the tea-urns, and endeavoured to run away; and seeing that I went up; Mr. Tyler's son laid hold of him, and there was a scuffle; I heard the cry of stop thief; I caught hold of him by the collar, and took him back to Mr. Tyler's; the teaurns were taken in.
Do you know who the tea-urns were delivered to?
I believe they were delivered to young Mr. Tyler.
I am a brazier: I was at work in the back shop; I was called out; I saw the prisoner and the tea-urns in the front shop.
He had not the tea-urns upon him at that time?
No, they were standing upon the sideboard; it is not a counter.
I am a brazier; I work for Mr. Tyler: I was going through the shop on Tuesday, the 15th of July, and saw two teaurns standing upon the sideboard of that pattern; I saw them both coming and going back, I was out but a few minutes; soon after that I was called out, the prisoner was then in the shop, within hearing; Mr. Tyler's son desired me to go for a constable; the prisoner did not say any thing; the urns were delivered to the constable.
I am a constable (produced the property.) I received them from Mr. Tyler's son, after the prisoner was in custody.
(To Callow.) Whose urns are these?
I believe them to be Mr. Tyler's; I have no doubt of it; his name is at the bottom of them, in the cast work; they are the same pattern that I saw in passing through the shop, and they are my own finishing.
When Mr. Tyler sells tea-urns do you take out his name?
No; it must be scraped out, or field out.
Whether young Mr. Tyler had sold these urns or not, after you first saw them, you cannot tell?
No; I was in the back shop.
