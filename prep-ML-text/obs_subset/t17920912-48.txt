I am wife to Jacob Davis , he keeps a cloth's shop ; the prisoner came into our to buy a pair of stockings, between eleven and twelve in the forenoon; I shewed her some stockings, and she bid me money for a pair, which I could not take; it was pinned to a petticoat, which she cheapened; I missed the cloak, and sent the girl after her; she had not been out of the house two minutes; I went out before she came back, and met her about two yards from my own door; the cloak was in her lap; I have it here (produced) I have had it ever since last winter; it is a dyed cloak.
My mistress called me out of the parlour; I went out after her, and I brought her back; she said she had no cloak in her apron; I am servant to the prosecutor; I am a jewess, and so is my mistress.
