I live at Stamford-hill: I had seen the pig the day before it was lost; I missed it a little before six o'clock on the Tuesday morning; I went with Elby to the house of Mr. Ross, in King-street, Wapping; we got there before eight o'clock the same morning; we found the pig there in a garret, and the sack that it was conveyed away in; the sack was not mine, but it was upon my premises; I immediately took the prisoner; he said he knew nothing of it.
I am servant to Mr. Hanbury: I know the prisoner very well; I saw him on my master's wharf on Monday, the 24th, about one hundred yards from my master's house, where the pig was; and, a little after ten, I saw him drinking at a public-house, with some of my master's people.
I am a labouring man at Newington: On Tuesday morning, the 25th of May, I saw the prisoner, about five o'clock in the morning, just coming into Newington, with a pig in a sack; just as he passed me, the pig struggled, and began to make a noise; I am sure he is the same man.
Will you swear I was the man?
Yes; I was drinking with him the night before.
I am the wife of John Ross; I live in King-street, Wapping: The prisoner has lodged in my fore-garret three years and a half; I did not see the pig at all.
I am an officer: I went with Mr. Hanbury to this woman's house, on Tuesday, the 25th of May; I found the pig in the front-garret of Ross's house; after we had found the pig, I found the sack in the fire-place; and then I went and apprehended the prisoner.
I know nothing at all about it; I never saw it with my eyes.
