John Turing is unwell; he lost a greatcoat on the night of the 2d of February last; the prisoner at the bar came to his house in Sloane-street, Chelsea , with a small basket of fruit, with Colonel Smith's compliments, and begged to know if Mrs. Turing wanted any more of the same kind, as a present; they were oranges; it was Colonel George Smith , he is in the Court now; I being the servant of the house, desired him to come in, and shut the door after him; I took the fruit up stairs; I rather suspecting the man, stopt at the first flight of stairs, and saw the man take four great-coats off the pins, that hung in the hall, and run out with them; when I saw that, I came down stairs, and gave the alarm, at the door, of stop thief! immediately, when he heard that, he dropt the greatcoats, and run; I pursued him, and caught him; he was out of my sight about half a minute.
When you did take him, was you certain he was the man that came in with the oranges?
Yes.
Were these great-coats the property of Mr. Turing?
The property of Mr. Turing and his sons; Mr. Turing's name is John, and his sons names are John and William.
What is the value of Mr. Turing's coat?
It may be worth 40 s.
The gentleman did not apprehend me; I went to see a young fellow of the name of George Ildman , and I was standing talking to him in Sloane-street, and this gentleman came up and took me: I hope, my Lord, you will send me for an East-India soldier, as I dare say the gentlemen of the Jury will find me guilty.
