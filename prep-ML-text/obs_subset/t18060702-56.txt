You are a widow.
Yes, I live in Devonshire-street, Queen's-square .
Do you keep the whole house.
Yes.
When was it you lost these things.
On the 18th of May, I did not sleep at home that night the things were stolen, my daughter was at home, and my servant.
What parish is it in.
St. George the Martyr's.
You live with your mother, do you.
Yes, all that I know is that when the servant got up in the morning she found the house door open.
What time did you get up in the morning.
About seven o'clock, the servant asked me if I had taken the plate from the side board.
Have you ever found any of your property.
None.
What have you lost.
All the articles which is mentioned in the indictment.
Were all these things in the parlour.
The plate was in the back-parlour, which is our sitting room, and my wearing apparel were in a third room.
Was any body in your house besides you and the maid servant.
There were other lodgers in the house, a lady and gentleman, and another gentleman of respectability.
You are servant to Mrs. Thornburgh
I am, I know nothing further than when I came down in the morning I found the street door open.
How had it been opened, had it been forced or how.
It was not forced; I went into the back parlour, I found the silver was all gone from the side board.
Why do you accuse this man of taking it.
Because he left the house ever since.
He was a lodger in the house and he absconded at the time.
How long had he lodged in your house.
Near three weeks.
What name did he lodge by in your house.
Preston.
What did he pretend to be.
An American ship owner.
When was it he left your house.
On the 18th of May in the morning before the servant was up, the servant went into his room finding the street door open, she found that he had left his room.
Had you seen him in the house the night before.
Yes, he had sat with me some hours.
What time did you go to bed.
I believe we went to bed about half after eleven o'clock.
Who shut the door.
I in general see to the fastenings of the door, I saw it fastened myself that night, I left the key in the inside, and he went to bed.
I think you said the prisoner was sitting with you some part of the time the night before, in what room.
The back parlour.
When did you look over all these things.
The day before, very likely.
You cannot say with certainty when you saw these things.
I cannot, only my cloak I saw the night before, that I can say from a particular circumstance.
Any of your lodgers might let themselves out.
Yes.
But suspicion fell on him, and you had three lodgers in the house; how many servants were there in the house.
Two.
There was a servant of the lodgers as well as your own.
Yes.
What time these servants got up you do not know, what acquaintance they have you do not know.
Our own servant we have got a good opinion of.
No doubt, we have a good opinion of many till we find them out, you never found any thing.
Not an article.
Every person in the house had equal means of getting to this property as well as the prisoner.
Yes.
What room had this man.
A back room on the second floor, and the liberty of breakfasting in our parlour.
Did you board him.
No.
How came you to accuse him by the name of Jones.
He was taken up by that name, he was not taken up by us; on the 18th of May he absconded from us, we never saw him for six weeks afterwards, I then saw him at the prison in Horsemonger lane; that was six weeks afterwards.
How long had he been there.
I think the goalor told us three weeks or a fortnight.
You do not know of any other lodger having gone out that morning.
No, they were all in bed.
(to prosecutrix) How came you to take this man without a character.
I had no character with him, he said he was a ship owner, he was a stranger, he would give me a reference in two or three days when he had cleared the ship; it was the first time I suffered a person to come into my house without a character; he did give me a reference to a banker's, but I did not go.
(to Macbride) Now young woman you got up at seven o'clock in the morning, you found the door open, you looked in the parlour and found the things were gone.
Yes, when I went down I found the adjoining room open, I went down into the kitchen, and the kitchen window was open, I went up stairs and alarmed the house.
Who did you find at home.
All the family, the lady and gentlemen were in bed, and Mr. Reynolds the other gentleman, he was in bed, the servant came down at the same time with me.
Did she lay in the same room with you.
No, in the next room to me, I heard her get up and come down.
Did you go into this man's room.
I did, I found nobody there.
Had he been in bed.
Yes, he had.
Did you find whether it was warm or no.
No.
He had no property in the house.
He left his nightcap, that was all.
He had no box.
No.
Had he no property with him, no linen to change.
He left nothing behind, not so much as an handkerchief.
Did he not bring any thing with him.
Nothing at all.
You saw the kitchen window open.
I did.
Somebody might have come in at that window.
They might.
Are you sure that the kitchen window was fastened that night.
I am sure it was fastened.
Supposing any person in the house to have taken this property, and to have gone out of the door, it would have been unnecessary to have opened the kitchen window.
Yes.
Was there any appearance of the window being broke.
No.
Was the sash up.
I did not take particular notice.
Then for what you know it may have been up.
It may.
On any persons coming in at that window they might have shut the sash after them though they did not put the shutters up, I suppose you are a hard working girl, you generally sleep the night through.
Yes.
Therefore any body coming up the stairs, they might have gone down again without your knowing it.
They might.
Were the shutters on the outside or within.
The shutters were on the inside fastened with a bar.
Then a person on the outside could not have opened these shutters.
No.
Was there any appearance of any body coming in at the window.
No, the window shutter was open enough to give light.
Did any body examine the window.
I do not think they did.
May it please your lordship, in the first place my taking the name of Preston, was not in any way to commit any fraud, but merely from embarrassed circumstances; I solemnly declare that when I went out I pulled to the street door after me, I went out of town not with any view of defrauding the prosecutrix, neither did I know any thing of it at the time; I knew not of the robbery till such times I was accused by the prosecutrix, I had no other intent than to pay the lady for the lodgings.
(to prosecutrix) Did not he pay for the lodging.
No, I received half a crown earnest when he took the lodging, the lodging was eleven shillings a week.
The lady said I might pay it monthly, I was expecting remittances, I actually did send her a letter, saying I was obliged to go out of town, and that I meant to send her the money
What led you to discover him in prison.
In consequence of information I received he was in prison for an offence he had committed two years ago.
I hope the honourable court will not suffer this to prejudice my case, I was in there for debt; there was a gentleman called there that morning; when I came down stairs I found the door had been unbolted, and that somebody had been out.
Mr. Reynolds, the gentleman that I said before was our lodger, intended that morning to go by the Bath coach at three o'clock; this man undertook to call him, which he did, he came down stairs to speak to his friend, he told me that he only bolted the door, he was too ill to go to Bath, he returned to bed again; he is a man of fortune and of great respectability.
(to the servant.) Whether I have not called you up several times to go to your sweetheart.
He has called me when I wanted to get up at six o'clock.
She is a married woman, therefore it is not likely.
From my embarrassed circumstances it has not been in my power to have brought forward witnesses to my character; my reason for stopping away was I was every moment expecting to be arrested, I went to Gravesend, I was ashamed to send to any body to let them know the situation I was in; during all the time I was in that house, the house was totally free and open for me; if so be I had a bad intent, why go out in that manner, I might have gone when they had been out to the play, as the house was totally open.
