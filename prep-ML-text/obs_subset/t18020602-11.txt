I live in Mr. Thomas Vincent 's house, James-street, Manchester-square , and sleep in the back kitchen: On Wednesday morning, the 5th of May, about a quarter before six, I saw the prisoner go across the yard out of the washhouse, with the property upon him; I stopped him with a copper in his arms, and the property in it; he immediately shoved me backwards, dropped the things, and ran out at the door; I pursued him, and never lost sight of him, till he was stopped at the top of Gray-street, Manchester-square; I got assistance, and brought him back to the place where he had dropped the property.
I stopped the prisoner at the top of Gray-street, Manchester-square; Mr Fell came up, and I assisted in bringing him back.
I am entirely innocent of the charge that is laid against me; I heard the cry of stop thief; I ran with other people, and they laid hold of me. GUILTY , aged 20.
