I am apprentice to Mr. Lowe, who is a pawnbroker , and lives in Baldwin's Gardens . I was in a room adjoining to the shop on the 5th of August. There is a glass frame inside the shop window, in which the goods are kept. I saw the glass frame slide back; I immediately ran out and found the prisoner in the shop. I laid hold of him and found these handkerchiefs in his pocket.
I beg I may be sent to sea.
