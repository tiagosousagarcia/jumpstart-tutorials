I am a builder . I only know that the property stated is mine: I did not see him take it; I saw it in one of the houses in Tabernacle New Road , three or four hours before it was stolen, which was on Saturday last.
I am a carpenter. As I was coming from the pay table Saturday week past, between seven and eight in the evening, I heard a great noise in one of the buildings belonging to my master; I stepped up and saw this bit of wainscot leaning out of the passage, half way in and half way out, with a rope round it; I heard a great noise as if it was cracking of wood; I walked backward and forward, and waited till the prisoner came out, which after a little bit he did, and took this bit of wainscot, and moved it from the door; I directly ran up to him and took it from his arms, and called a man to assist me, and took him down to the pay table; I then put it in the cellar, and when we came back again we put it in another house, and locked it up: I am sure it is the same piece; I have not the least doubt: I gave it to the constable on the next Tuesday afternoon, and it has been in his care ever since: the constable's name is Michael Wayman .
Was that wainscot fixed up?
I believe it was pulled down before.
Where did you light of me?
I watched him out of the house, and took him with the wainscot: I saw a great deal broken up which is not mentioned in the indictment, all ready to take off, in the passage; but I took him with this in his arms.
What occasion had that door to be open at that time?
I cannot say any thing about that.
I know no more than taking the prisoner into custody at Mr. Rolfe's, and that I have had the wainscot in my possession, brought me by Wingarth.
I was coming by the building and saw the door open, and being much distressed I went in to see for a bit of old wood to put under my arm, and I saw this, and I took what I could get.
