I am a carpenter ; I live at No. 46, Well-street, Oxford-street ; the prisoner was a journeyman of mine; the things were found after he was discharged from my service.
I am a journeyman to Mr. Wallis. On Saturday, the 6th of May, Alexander Courtney was discharged from Mr. Wallis's service; on the Monday he came for his tools; after he had fetched his tools I looked for the square; I could not find it; and sundry other articles being missing, a warrant was obtained for the prisoner; we found him opposite of the Thatched House, Islington; the square and the saw was found where he was at work, and the remainder of the property was found at his lodgings.
I am a constable, I went with a warrant in company with Hanfleet, Mr. Wallis's foreman, and Fell, to No. 14, opposite of the Thatched House, Islington, where I saw the prisoner; there was a saw stood there, Hanfleet said this saw belongs to my master; this square was found in the same room; he said he had taken them for the use, he meaned to bring the saw and the square back to his master's promises at night. I took him in custody. After he was committed I went to his lodgings, No. 31, Great Earl-street, Seven Dials; from there I brought away two planes, a copper glue pot, and a till.
I was rather intoxicated at the time; I meaned to return them in the afternoon.
