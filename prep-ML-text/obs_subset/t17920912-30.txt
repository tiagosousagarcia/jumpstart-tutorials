I am a linen-draper , at Charing-cross, the prisoner became my servant in March, on August 14th I discharged him; I told him I had a suspicion, and must examine his box; I went up stairs and examined his box, I desired him to let me examine further, which he refused; then I called up Mr. Husband; I then looked further, I found something not not marked; I then looked both the boxes, and gave Mr. Husband the keys, and ordered the prisoner out of my house, and never to come near my house any more; he came next day, and wished me to be reconciled; I told him to be gone, or I would send for a constable; I told him if he did not immediately depart I would send him to Botany-Bay, he would not go, so at lenth I sent for a constable; I produce the property which I swear to.
