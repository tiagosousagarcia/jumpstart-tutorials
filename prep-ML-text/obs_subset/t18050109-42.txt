- I am a butcher , in Lamb-street, Spitalfields : Yesterday evening, just at dark, my boy informed me that a man had stole a bullock's head, and had gone down Crispin-street with it; I ran after him, and overtook him, with the bullock's head in his hand; I brought him back, and took him into custody.
I am apprentice to Mr. Covington: Last night as I was going into the shop, I saw a man standing at the door about five or six minutes before I saw him take it down; he took it down, and had the bullock's head in his hand, and went up Crispin-street; I told my master, and he ran after him.
As I was coming from my wife, who was out to a day's washing, I was rather distressed, I had been out of business a long while, I took it to support my family; it was merely for want that I did such a thing.
A man came to me this morning, from his wife, and gave him a good character.
