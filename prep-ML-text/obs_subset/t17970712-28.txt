On the 17th of June, I lost a shirt, and a child's pin a-fore, they were hanging out in the garden; I have never seen them since.
I saw the prisoner take the things off the line.
What time was it?
A little before ten.
What time was it when you came to take me?
A little before twelve.
Had you known him before?
Yes; I am sure he is the man, he lives at Haggerston.
I was not out of my own house from nine o'clock till past twelve, when the watchman came to take me.
