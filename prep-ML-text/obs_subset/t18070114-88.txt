I am servant to Mr. Newman, Turnmill street. On the 13th of November the prisoner called at the house, and ordered two pots of porter and change for half a guinea, to be sent into Castle street. I took the porter and the change, he went with me, and at the corner of Castle street he asked me if I had got the change, I told him yes; he asked me to give it him, I gave him the change, a dollar, two shillings, five sixpences, and four halfpence; the beer came to tenpence, that made the change.
Did he give you the half guinea.
No, he put a halfpenny into my hand; I turned round to see what I had got, he was off, I halloed after him; he was not taken till the next morning. I am sure he is the man.
I am innocent of the fact.
