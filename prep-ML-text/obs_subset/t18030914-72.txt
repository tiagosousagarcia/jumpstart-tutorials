- I live at No. 1, Gresse-street, Rathbone-place , and am a single woman ; On the 2d of July, about ten o'clock in the morning, the prisoner, my landlady, came into my room, and asked me if I had any money; I said, no; I owed her money for rent; she saw a gown laying on the bed, and said, that is the gown you bought of me, and I'll have it; she took it under her arm into her own room, and locked it up in the cupboard; I tried to pull it from her, but could not, I did not say any thing to her; I asked her for it repeatedly, but she would not give it me. On the 11th of July, I went to the Magistrates, and she was taken up. NOT GUILTY .
