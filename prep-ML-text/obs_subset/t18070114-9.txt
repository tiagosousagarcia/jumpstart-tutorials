I am a publican , I live at the George, Greek street, Soho . On the 16th of December the prisoner came into my service; she continued with me till the 20th, and when she was gone a number of things were missing by my niece; on the Monday following I was told that she was getting her dinner at the alamode beef shop; that was on the 22nd. I had her taken into custody, she had a bundle with her, and in the bundle part of the property was found, and she gave me the duplicates of some of the other things; the pawnbroker produced them at Marlborough street and gave up the property. She took me and the constable to an old clothes shop in Great St. Andrew street, where she had sold a pair of sheets for five shillings. When the constable searched her he found two more duplicates besides, which were my property, and they were given up at Marlborough street.
