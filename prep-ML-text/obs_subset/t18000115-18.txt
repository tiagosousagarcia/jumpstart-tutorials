On the 25th of September last, I was coming home from Mr. Gilson's house, the Swan, in Gate-street, Spitalfields: I had six-pennyworth of gin and water, and I gave the landlord a half-crown to change, and he gave me two shillings in change, another young man came with me; as we were coming to George-street , John Colley, Moses Davis, and Solomon Robus, came up to us; Colley came up to me and made a snap at my hair, and I received a blow from him; I got clear from him, and the prisoner at the bar came up, and cut me with a knife, or some other sharp instrument, and then he made off; and Davis came up to me and knocked me down, and tore the pocket clean out of my waistcoat, with two shillings in it, and some halfpence; and then they stamped upon me, and left me for dead as they thought; I have nothing to say against the prisoner for putting his hand in my pocket, or any thing.
You have been here two Sessions, have not you?
Yes.
You prosecuted Davis and Colley?
Yes.
They were tried at different Sessions?
Yes.
And each time the Jury acquitted each of these persons?
Yes.
You applied to the Court, at both Sessions, for your expences?
Yes.
But at neither Sessions did the Court grant you your expences?
No.
You were stunned with the blow when you were knocked down?
Yes.
It was not till after you were upon the ground that they took your pocket away?
No.
Did you at that time, or any time after, look upon the ground to see if you could find the two shillings?
No, I was not able.
Nor any body else?
No; their lives were in danger.
Do you know Bracher?
Yes.
I believe, upon the first trial, Bracher swore that it was Davis knocked you down?
Yes; and he has since said it was a mistake.
Riley and me were going to George-street, and Solomon Robus came out, with Colley and Moses Davis , and Robus knocked him down.
It was not Davis that knocked Riley down then?
No; and when I returned back, Robus knocked me down, and Colley and Davis stabbed me in the arm.
What office did you apply to to take the prisoner up?
Worship-street was the first.
And did they grant a warrant for the robbery?
No, for an assault.
Where did you get your warrant for a highway-robbery?
I did not get it.
You applied to Worship-street for a warrant?
We went to Worship-street and got a warrant, but they were not taken; and then I went to Lambeth-street.
You did apply to Worship-street first, and they granted you a warrant for the assault?
I did not, Gilson did, and Bush.
Were you there?
Yes.
Did you then make known to the Justices, or to the officers, that you had been robbed?
No, I did not; I left it to those people that went in before me, I did not know how to proceed in it.
Did you go a second time to Worship-street?
Yes.
You never got from Worship-street any thing but the warrant for the assault?
No.
Did not the officers know that you had been robbed?
Yes.
And yet the Magistrate only thought sit to grant a warrant for an assault?
He did.
You went to Lambeth-street office afterwards, and made a charge of the robbery?
Yes.
Was not that a month afterwards?
No, it might be seven or eight days.
You never heard of forty pounds reward?
Yes, you were the person that first told me of it.
I did not see the beginning of the transaction, nor I did not see any thing of the robbery.
