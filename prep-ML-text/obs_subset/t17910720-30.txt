On the 14th of June, (I have a room in the Cricket-ground at Marybone , and keep the Cricket-ground ,) I lost the things mentioned in the indictment.
On the 14th of June, about six in the morning, I found this room was broke open, the pannel of the door was taken out, and the things gone, which I locked up over night, and lost my waistcoat and six dozen of oranges, which were under my care for a gentleman. I looked over the field, and I found one of the cruets, but nothing else; the next day I saw the things at the Justices.
I am a watchman, I stopped the prisoner, he shunned me, and I took him into custody, with the property on him, he threw down the basket and ran away, he was brought back, I searched him. All the property is here, which he had on his shoulder.
I took him into custody, and have kept the things ever since. (Produced some of the things and deposed to). This centre bit matched to the hole in the door.
I had been to seek for work on Monday, and returning and laying down under some hay, and in the night two men came and brought these things and hid them, and in the morning I went to see what it was and I took it up, I did not know the consequence of meddling with it. I am a stranger entirely in this part of the world. I have no friends.
