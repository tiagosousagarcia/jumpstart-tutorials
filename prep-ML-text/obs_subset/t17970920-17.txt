sworn. - In the course of five or six weeks, from the beginning of July to the end of August, I was robbed of different articles of my property, from my lodgings, in Upper Ranelagh-street, Pimlico ; the prisoner was a servant in the house, and I suspected her; I had lived a twelve month there; the man of the house came in and informed me he had found one of my shirts in her bed; the next day a warrant was issued, and she was apprehended; she is very young, and I wished very much to recommend her; my room-door was always left open, and she might have gone in at first out of curiosity, and not with intention to take any thing, but seeing the things about, could not resist the temptation; I understand she has been very ill since she has been in confinement.
- I am a constable: On the 19th of August, I searched the prisoner, and found these stocking in her pocket, (producing them) ; Donaldson, the other constable, found one of Captain Harrison's shirts concealed under her bed, and she then informed us, that the rest of Captain Harrison's things were pawned at different pawnbrokers that are here; she at first said she had given them to another woman.
I found this under the prisoner's bed.
I found the stockings in the back kitchen; I put them in my pocket to give the gentleman, and forgot it.
