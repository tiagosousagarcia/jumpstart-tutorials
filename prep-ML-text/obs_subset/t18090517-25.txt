I am servant to John Francis Lutterill , esq. in Somersetshire.
What is the prisoner
I never saw him before I saw him in Marlborough-street; I lost the boots from Hatchet's hotel in Picadilly . On Saturday morning, the 29th of April, I took the boots down stairs to clean them and put them in the servant's hall; I went out at two o'clock with my master to Devonshire-place; I left them there, and when I came back I found the boots were gone; I made enquiry of the servants that were there; none of them knew any thing about them. On Tuesday the 2nd of May as I was walking up Swallow-street I saw the boots in the boot-maker's shop; I went in and looked at the boots, I found them to be my own. I asked the price of the boots, he asked me twenty-eight shillings for them; I said I did not know that I wanted a pair myself, I had a fellow servant that did; I would return back to Hatchet's hotel, I would bring the waiter up with me; I did; the waiter was going to try them on, the master of the shop said, they were too large for him; then I told him the boots were mine; he said that he bought them on the Monday before.
I am a shoemaker, in Swallow-street. On the 1st of May, the prisoner came to my house, and offered the boots for sale, he asked twenty-five shillings for them, I bid him a pound, he said he could not take it, because they belonged to another man, he could not take less than a guinea; he went away, and staid for two hours; then he came again, told me that the man would take the money for the boots. I paid him for them.
Now look at the man
That is the man. I had seen him before; I thought he was a servant. They are the same boots that Mr. Bowdridge claimed.
He told you they were not his own
. Yes, he said he sold them for another.
