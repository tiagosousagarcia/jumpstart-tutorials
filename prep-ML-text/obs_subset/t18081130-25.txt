John Freemantle , and John Branton.
I am a servant to the last witness. On the 10th of November last, in the morning, the prisoner was seen to take three dozen locks; he went away then with them at two o'clock, and returned to work again on the same day; I put him to work up in the warehouse. I saw him put one dozen of locks in his pocket; after that I came into the front shop; he was seen to put another dozen in his pocket, by a lad that is in court, he came down and went out; I followed him as far as Old street, Goswell street, I collared him and one dozen of brass locks fell from him; I took him to the constable. He searched him, and found a dozen of iron locks in his possession.
I am an apprentice to Mr. Freemantle. On the 10th of November I went up stairs for some nails for the carpenter; on the top of the stairs I saw the prisoner put one dozen of locks in his pocket; they were so wrapped up as they are now; I told the foreman; the prisoner went down the stairs, and went out of the shop; I shut the door after him; the man went after him.
