I live at No. 21, George-yard ; the prisoner lodged in the same room with me two nights; she slept in another bed; I left my property at the side of my bed on a stool; on Friday morning, the 30th of May, between two and three, I awaked and missed them; the prisoner was gone; I got up, put on my cloaths, and my mother and I found the prisoner in the privy of the next house; she had got over a wall fourteen feet high; she had my petticoat and apron on; the rest were tied up in a bundle in her hand; she was delivered to the watchman.
What way of business are you in?
A weaveress .
I have nothing to say.
