I am a taylor in Hare-court, No. 9, Aldersgate-street. I lost my watch on Friday the 13th of September last, I was going through St. Paul's church-yard towards Ludgate-Hill, about eight o'clock; and this woman came up and asked me how I did, and pretended she wanted to speak to me; while I stopped speaking to her, she picked my watch out of my pocket; she took me up into an alley, and wanted me to go into a house there; I told her I could not stop, I was going to supper. In the mean time she picked my watch out of my pocket, it was in my fob.
How do you know it was her?
She picked it out before my eyes, she put it into her bosom; then I immediately took my watch from her by force and after I had taken it from her, she cryed out Stop thief, and murder! Mr. Clarke the constable was coming through St. Paul's church-yard, in the mean time, and I gave him charge of her, he took her to Poultry Compter; I had got my watch myself before.
So you saw her take your watch out of your pocket, and put it into her bosom, and you took it away?
Yes.
Did she claim the watch, because she called Stop thief?
No.
What was her reason for calling Stop thief?
She had no reason at all.
Was there nothing but conversation passed between you and this woman?
Nothing, my Lord, I had no connection with the woman, nor never meant it, so help me God I have nothing more to say.
I know nothing about the man's watch: the constable is here, who can witness to my ill usage.
I was going through St. Paul's church-yard, near eight o'clock; I heard a noise, they said a young woman had picked a young man's pocket; she lay on the ground when I came up, I took her to the Compter, I took her before my Lord Mayor, he committed her.
