I am a lighterman . On Friday week I took a barge full of empty casks for Ralph's quay , and on Monday when I came to take the barge away, there was thirty four; there should have been thirty five.
I am watchman of the quay, I saw this man take it off the barge.
I am a watchman in Golden lane, St. Luke's. On Sunday morning I saw the prisoner bringing the cask along Golden lane; I stopped him with it; I asked him where he was going with it, he said he was going to take it home; I saw the name of Barclay, Perkins, and co. on it; I told him he must put it on his shoulder, and go along with me to the watch-house.
I lost a kilderkin marked Barclay, Perkins, and co.; it is impossible to say it was this cask.
I was at work on the Colchester barge; this cask was on the deck; I took it for Brown and Parry's in a mistake; and when I came into Golden lane I saw it was Barclay and Perkins; that has brought me into this trouble.
John Elvin , the wharfinger, has lost two casks before by this man.
