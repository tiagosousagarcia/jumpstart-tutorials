Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am a commodore in the East India Company's warehouse, Crutched Friars , the prisoner at the bar was a labourer in the gang that I had the command of in that warehouse.
Had you observed any Mocoa coffee in that warehouse.
Yes, and there was one bale cut, and there seemed to be three or four pounds gone; as he was going out of the door I said I was going to rub our gang down, he appeared confused in my rubbing him down, in two small pockets hanging quite behind, I felt something like coffee, I told him he must go with me to the elder's office, he immediately answered, pray Mr. Soul do not take me there, for God's sake, do not; on being taken there an officer was sent for; in his pocket was found one pound seven ounces of coffee.
You are the King's locker.
Yes, I found the coffee in the possession of the prisoner, it weighs one pound seven ounces, it is Mocoa coffee.
In the morning I hung up my coat about eight o'clock, I never was nigh it till after three o'clock, I know not how the coffee was put in my pocket, there was nothing in my pocket when I hung it up; I said for God's sake do not say this coffee is in my pocket, it is unknown to me.
