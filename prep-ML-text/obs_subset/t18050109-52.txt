You are the wife of James Shepherd, he is a baker, living in Great Eastcheap ?
Yes.
Do you remember the prisoner coming to your house?
Yes, on Friday, the 28th of December last, between five and six o'clock; it was dark, I had a light in the shop; he came into the shop, and asked me for half a quartern loaf, and he gave me a shilling; I was to give him change for it; my husband came in at the same time, and he asked me to let him look at it; I gave my husband the shilling, and he said it was a bad one.
What became of the shilling?
My husband had the shilling, and my husband told the prisoner that he suspected that he had seen him before.
Do you remember being in the shop on the day your wife has been speaking of?
I came into the shop at the time; I asked her for the shilling, and she gave it to me; I observed it was a bad one; I told the prisoner that he had been there twice before; he had bought two half-quarterns before that, I served him myself, and he had tendered to me two bad shillings before; I sent for the Officer, and he searched him; he stood just against the back of a bin just in the shop; I saw a shilling and sixpence lay in the bin.
The bin was open?
Yes, there was nothing in the bin but a piece of mat at the time; I found the shilling and the sixpence there; I took it out and gave it to the Officer.
Did you see any thing else?
Yes, there was a sixpence found on the floor.
You are one of the Officers of the city?
Yes; I produce the shilling that was tendered to Mrs. Shepherd, and 1 s. 6 d. that was found in the corn-bin; I saw it in the corn-bin; I have had it in my custody ever since.
There was a sixpence that lay on the floor just by where he stood; did the prisoner say any thing?
He said that nothing of that kind belonged to him.
Did he say any thing about the first shilling that he tendered to Mrs. Shepherd?
No, nothing at all.
(To Prosecutor.) Did I stand near the bin where the money was found?
Yes, with your back against it.
(To Prosecutor.) Was that the shilling that the prisoner uttered to you first (handed to him)
Yes.
You are a silversmith, and acquainted with money; look at this shilling?
(Looks at it.) It is a counterfeit shilling.
Look at the other?
It is impossible to tell some till I break them; (breaks them;) they are both counterfeit.
They are particularly well coloured; it requires your breaking them to tell what they are?
It does.
(To the prosecutor.) Are they all bad?
They are.
When you saw this man in your shop, you say you knew him, you had seen him there twice before; are you sure that he was the man that you saw before?
Yes, once before; he came on the Friday week before that.
Was the money bad then?
Yes, and I believe he had been there once before that, I perceived it was a bad one just as he went out of the shop; I pursued after him, but missed him.
