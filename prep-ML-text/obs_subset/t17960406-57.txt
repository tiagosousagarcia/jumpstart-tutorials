I am clerk to Mr. Burton, plumber , Newcastle-street, in the Strand : On the 31st of March, about seven o'clock in the morning; I found in the passage leading into the coal cellar, a quantity of lead, which appeared to me to be hid; I sent the prisoner, for some coals, he came up again with the coals, and a few minutes after I went down, and I found he had not taken it away, but concealed it better than it was before; he came home in the evening, I let him in with the carter; I gave each of them a candlestick to take through the counting-house to go into the stable; I thought the prisoner was rather longer than he needed to be, and I went outside the shop door in the yard, till I saw him come out of the cellar; he met me in the yard, and said, he had as good go home; I told him to stop and help the carter a little; I then waited till the prisoner came out, and within twenty-yards of our gates, I stopped him with the lead upon him, which weighted forty-five pounds; when I found that it was hid, and that he was gone to Homerton, I went into the cellar and put a mark upon it.
Do you know that that lead that was in the cellar was the property of Mr. Burton?
Yes.
I have nothing to say, but throw myself on the mercy of the Court.
