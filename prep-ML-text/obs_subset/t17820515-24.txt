I keep the White Horse, in Friday-street . On the 17th of April, about five o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner came to my house. In about an hour after, I was sent for to the Blue Lasts, where I saw the prisoner, and a pint pot and a half-pint pot of mine.
I keep the Blue Lasts; in Distaff-lane. On the 17th of April, the prisoner came into my house; I had some suspicion of her; I clapped my hand to her, and felt the pint pot; I searched her, and found the pots mentioned in the indictment, with some others, upon her; I sent for Mr. Dawson; he said they were his pots.
A young woman, who was a gathering in her pots, found these two pots among hers: she said they belonged to such a person, and asked me to take them; I put them into my pocket, and went to the gentleman's house.
