I keep a lodging-house , No. 91, Grub-street : On Tuesday the 5th of January, I let a lodging to the prisoner, at half-a-crown a week; the articles mentioned in the indictment were let to him with the lodging; when he had had the lodging five weeks and two days, I found that he cohabited with a bad woman; I got admission into the room, and missed the property; he said, the woman had pawned them, but meant to redeem them; he delivered me the duplicates of the sheets and blankets, they were pawned in the name of Smith; I sent for an officer, gave charge of him, and took him before the Alderman at Guildhall.
Did I not tell you I would pay you as soon as I got into work?
Yes.
I am the wife of the last witness; I was not present when the lodging was let to the prisoner, but I delivered him the sheets, the other things were in the room; I can swear to the property; that is all I know.
I am servant to Mr. Needham, a pawnbroker, in Whitecross-street: I don't know the prisoner; I took in a blanket, on the 26th of January, from a woman, I gave her a duplicate.
My husband is a pawnbroker, in Whitecross-street: The prisoner never pawned any thing with me; I received two sheets, and a blanket, from a woman, one on the 7th, one on the 8th, and one on the 19th of January, in the names of Martha Smith and Sarah Smith .( William Field , a constable, produced the duplicates, which were proved by the pawnbrokers to be the same that had been delivered upon the receipt of the articles.)(The property was identified by the prosecutor.)
I did not intend to steal the things.
