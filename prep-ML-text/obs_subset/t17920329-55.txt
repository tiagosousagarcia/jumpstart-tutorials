I am a cheesemonger . I lost a ham of bacon on Tuesday, the 13th of March, from a hook at my door, in Holborn; an alarm was given; I found the prisoner and the ham.
I was going along Holborn, and a man gave me sixpence to take it to the Old Sun, in Moorfields.
I had a very affecting letter from his father desiring he might be sent to the East Indies.
He must be transported: the Secretary of State may commute one kind of punishment for another: let it be mentioned to the Recorder.
