I live in Denmark-street ; I am a taylor ; on the 13th of December I missed the things in the indictment; I fancy they were taken on Sunday the 11th; the prisoner served the latter part of his time with me, two years, and rather better; the things were in a box, which was under a board where I cut out on; the box was locked; the constable took the key out of his pocket; the constable has the things.
On the 13th of December I took the prisoner, with the things.
I have nothing to say.
