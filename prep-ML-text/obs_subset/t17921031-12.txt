I live in Compton-street, Clerkenwell ; on the 10th of October I lost my things; I was sitting at dinner; I was informed a man had gone out with a bundle; I pursued him; I went to the prisoner, he had nothing of mine.
I am son of Joshua Walker ; as I was sitting at dinner on the 16th of October William Stone , our apprentice, came in and said, is any body gone out? my father said no; my father sent me after the prisoner; I came up with him; he was running across Northampton-street; I overtook him; he had the coat and hat under his right arm; I told him to stop; he dropped the coat and hat; I told him to stop; he would not; I knocked him down, and apprehended him; he said, do you want to rob me? and asked me to come out and fight; this is the hat and coat he dropped.
I am Mr. Walker's apprentice; I was at work in the back shop; my fellow apprentice said, there is somebody gone out of the shop; I did not see him go out.
I had been drinking with a young man, and he desired me to carry the goods to Islington, and he would pay me for my trouble.
