I know the prisoner; I heard the cry of stop thief in Redman's-row, the back of Mile-end, Stepney ; I saw two lads go into a pond to swim, and soon after I heard the cry of stop thief; I was in a house getting a pint of beer, at the sign of the Rose and Punch-bowl, in Redman's-row, I saw the prisoner run out of the field from the pond side; I ran after him, and when I came close to him, he threw away a pair of shoes and a little pair of silver buckles which I have in my pocket; I was within four or five yards of him; I picked up the shoes and buckles, and the prisoner was stopped immediately in my sight.
Whereabouts was you when this young man first went into the water?
About two hundred yards off; I saw him running from the pond.
What age are you?
Twelve.
What will become of you hereafter, if you take a false oath?
I shall go to hell Sir.
Have you been taught your catechism?
Yes.
I went to this pond to swim; I put my buckles, and shoes, and garters under my clothes.
There were other people running, and I run, and coming to cross Mile-end-road a gentleman stopped me.
