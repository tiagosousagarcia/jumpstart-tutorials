I am a shoe-maker, and live in Long-lane; Rebecca Brown is my master, she was married about four or five years go, at St. John's church, Southwark, to James Collett , by banns, I was present; she is alive, and in Court.
They lived together about a year and a half, I believe?
Yes.
Then she called in a broker, sold off his goods, and run away?
Yes.
Did he leave her or she him?
she left him.
I know the prisoner; he married me the 27th of July, 1802 , at St. Mary, Lambeth , by banns.
He told you he was afraid he had another wife - did not he?
He said, he had lived with a woman, and had a child, and perhaps I might hear something disagreeable of her.
How long did you live with him?
About sixteen months; I parted with him in consequence of his ill-usage, and had a warrant to take him up.
I leave my defence to my Counsel.
I am the prisoner's father, and knew Joanna Shaddock before my son married; I sent to him, and desired him to bring her before me, which he did; I asked her if he had told her he had another wife; she said, yes, but if he went down into the country with her, there could be no harm in her having him; I said, they had better stop, for I certainly would not allow it; however, they went and put up the banns in my absence, and were married; if I had known of the banns, I would have forbid them; but she knew he was married before.
