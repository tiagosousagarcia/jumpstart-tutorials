You are a clerk in the Bank, in the department of the Four per Cent. Office?
Assistant chief clerk of the Four and Five per Cent. Office; and also examiner of the powers of attorney.
Look at this instrument?
This has passed through my hands officially, as examiner; it was only made out at our office on the 16th of October, 1799; between that period and the 24th of October, this stock must have been sold out by virtue of this power of attorney; on examining the hand-writing, I looked at some books that were nearly eight years elapsed, and upon examining the hand-writing, I was well satisfied with those of John Purse , James Little, and William Sibbald; but in the handwriting of Abbott, I found a material difference; I sent for the broker, who I recollected to have given this power of attorney into my hand; having had some conversation with him, the broker sent the attorney to me, Joseph- Samuel Abbott , the prisoner at the bar; I told the prisoner there was a difference in the hand-writing of Joseph Abbott ; he told me that he was his father, that he had fallen into infirmity, and was not capable of writing correspondent with his former figuature; then observed, that by the designation of the witnesses, the parties did not appear to be at any great distance, I thought it would be expedient that they might come and transact their business without this power of attorney; in answer to which, he urged the illness of his father, who could not be moved; that the other parties would be very difficult to find, that the business was urgent, or to that purpose, and wished to compleat it immediately; taking these circumstances into consideration, knowing that the Bank wish to throw no difficulty in the way of business that can be avoided, I thought I might with safety permit him to do the business, accordingly I put my initials to it.
I believe you know that the Bank have replaced the stock, and that it stands now in the names of those witnesses?
Yes.
I act as a stock-broker; I have known the prisoner eight or ten years: On the 10th of October, he came to me to sell four hundred and fifty pounds, Four per Cents, by power of attorney; which stock I sold to a Mr. Benjamin Smith, and I paid Mr. Abbott, the prisoner at the bar, the money, with Mr. Smith's draft.
Look at that power of attorney?
This power of attorney I acted upon, by selling the stock on his account.
Have you the book in which there is a transfer of the stock of Abbott, Purse, Little, and Sibbald; I have, (produces it) I am a witness to the transfer.
Read the names of the parties? - A. John Purse , Joseph Abbott , James Little, and William Sibbald , four hundred and fifty pounds.

My Lord, and Gentlemen of the Jury, the crime with which I am charged, I am intirely innocent of; I am consident my word, as a prisoner, will avail but little; but, my Lord, it was regularly signed by the parties who had a right to sign it, and made over to me, and therefore I conceived myself justifiable in converting it to my own use; knowing the sufferings of those, who do commit such crimes, would have deterred me; but these men knew, that if I had not made the property good, it would not have been made good, and they have applied to the Bank to make it good; they have done it, and my life is in danger; I hope, gentlemen, you will take my case into your consideration; and when you have so done, if you are of opinion that I am guilty, I shall contrive to meet my fate with as much resignation as my situation will allow.
