I apprehended the prisoner, the 16th of this month, at a house in Poplar: on my entering the room, he jumped up, and seized this pistol, it was loaded with powder and two balls; he snapped it, but it did not go off; Kennedy was with me: a scuffle ensued, three other men were in the room; we fell on the ground, and somebody gave him a knife, with which he attempted to stab us. We called a coach, and brought him to Bow-street.
I had the pistol in my hand; but did not intend to fire it. Please to look at that paper (gives in a paper). I was tried in October Sessions, and honourably acquitted, and retaken again; then was at large four days, and a bill was found in the name of Wood for the same offence; the young man that was tried with me was acquitted; I sent instructions and money to Mr. Garrow, by a woman, and she never gave it him. I beg for mercy on account of my wife and children; my wife was brought to bed a fortnight ago.
