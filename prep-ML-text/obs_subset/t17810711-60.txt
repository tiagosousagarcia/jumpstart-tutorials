I sell fruit in the street . I went into a Mr. Bunker's, a public house, and called for a pint of beer. He gave me change. I disputed about a piece of money I had of him; and I fell asleep: but, before I fell asleep, I had in my pocket half-a-guinea, an half-crown, 2 s. 6 d. and seven farthings. There is a brass farthing that is remarkable, having a mark in the middle of it: I can swear positively to it. When I waked, I understood the prisoner had been detected taking my property, and carried to the round-house.
The prisoner and another man came in, and called for a pint of beer. The prosecutor was in the house, asleep, when they came in. The other man drank, and went out. I went out of the bar, and saw the prisoner ransacking the prosecutor's pocket. I saw him pull his hand out of his pocket. I took hold of his hand, and asked what he had got in his hand. He said, what was that to me. I opened his hand by force, and the money fell into my hand. There were 2 s. 6 d. one penny, and three farthings.
I took that farthing in change for a pint of beer.
