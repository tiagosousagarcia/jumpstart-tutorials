I was in the back parlour at tea: I saw a woman running out of the shop: I followed her: she ran away: I stopped her in Little George-street: she had a wrapper under her arm. I brought her back to the shop; I took from her the wrapper; I examined it; it contained eight pieces of linen; it had contained ten; it lay upon the counter with ten pieces in it (examining several of the pieces) these are my master's property; they have his mark.
I saw drop from the prisoner at the bar these two pieces.
I have nothing to say, but to beg for mercy.
