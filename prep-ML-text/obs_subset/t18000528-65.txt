I keep the White-hart public-house, in Foster-lane ; the prisoner at the bar had been at work in my house for three or four weeks, as a journeyman carpenter : On the 17th of April, after he had done work, he sat down in the tap-room, called for a pint of porter, and began smoking his pipe; the time-piece was kept in a window in the back-parlour adjoining the taproom; I went up stairs into the club-room with a friend, I left the prisoner in the tap-room; the next morning I missed the time-piece; it was afterwards found at the pawnbroker's.
I am a pawnbroker, servant to Mrs. Pearson in Fleet-marked, (produces a time-piece); it was pledged by Sarah Walker , on the 13th of April.
I am an officer: I went to the prisoner's house, had some conversation with his wife, and saw a duplicate in a glass upon the mantle-piece.
How do you know it was his house?
Only from information; he kept a little huckster's shop.
Did you ever see the prisoner in the house?
No, only the wife and family; I then went to the pawnbroker's, and found the time-piece; the prisoner desired me to go to a friend of his, to look to the children, and to take the property that was in the house.
I was at work on the 17th of April at the prosecutor's: I left off work at six o'clock, I sat down and had a pint of porter, I drank as many as five pints, besides a pipe of tobacco; I went to Mrs. Harding at the bar, and told her I had not money enough to pay her, I would pay her on Saturday night; I went out of doors through the passage into the street, and from there I went to another house, where I knew I could have a pint of beer without money; I had another pint there, and then went home to bed; my little boy was coming from the Sunday-school, the Sunday following, and picked up a bit of paper, and gave it to my wife, and she put it in the glass; it is not in my name, nor my wife's; my wife has been kept in prisoner ever since; I have been obliged to send my children to the work-house.
