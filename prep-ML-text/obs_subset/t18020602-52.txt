I am a widow, I live at No. 35, Litchfield-street, Soho , I keep a chandler's shop : On the 4th of June, the prisoner came in about a quarter past eleven at night, I did not see him come in, I was in the back room; the first thing I saw, was the prisoner endeavouring to throw the till away, when he found he could not get out at the door.
On Friday evening, a little after eleven o'clock, I went to Mrs. Milton's for some table-beer; I found a boy at the door, looking in, he asked me what o'clock it was, he appeared to me to be about seventeen or eighteen years of age; I told him it was past eleven; I endeavoured to go in at the shop-door, and he endeavoured to prevent me; I asked him, if he was going in, if not, let me go in; I then opened the door, and saw the prisoner coming from behind the counter, with something in his hand; when he got to the door, I saw it was the till, what it contained I don't know; I then called Mrs. Milton and the watchman, the prisoner was too strong for me, and got away.
The till contained in halfpence and silver, about eight or nine shillings; the prisoner has been in the habit of using my shop, and I had been daily stripped.
I was constable of the night, the prisoner was brought to me; there was a picklock found in his pocket.
I have nothing to say.
