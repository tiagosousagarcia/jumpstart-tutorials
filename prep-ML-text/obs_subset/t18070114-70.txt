I am a shoe maker , I live at No. 1, Little Windmill street, Haymarket . On the 5th of January about ten o'clock, the prisoner came in for work for her husband; I gave her work, and she went away; we missed a pair of shoes immediately. I went after her and could not find her. At three o'clock she come for some more work, and brought some work in. I observed the shoes as they lay when she came in, fifty pair, I had packed on a box and they lay as I put them; I stooped down to pick up some soles to give her, and on rising up I found one pair of shoes gone, the top pair; she went out of the shop about twenty yards. I brought her back, I told her she was a thief, she had stolen some shoes; I ordered her to open her apron, then she dropped the shoes down, she went on her knees and begged for mercy. I produce the shoes, they are my property.
Forgive me Mr. Knight, O , what have I done.
The husband is a very industerious man and she is a very industrious woman.
