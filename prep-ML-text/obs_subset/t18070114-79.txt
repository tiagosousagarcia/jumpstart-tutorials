What is your husband's name.
Thomas; he is a butcher , No. 27, Grosvenor street, Grosvenor square . This woman was a chairwoman , she worked for me ten days, then I missed the several things which are in the indictment.
Did you ever find them again.
Nothing but the window and bed curtains; she pulled out two duplicates out of her pocket, and owned to the taking of them.
I took in of the prisoner, on the 26th of November, a curtain, she pledged it for a shilling.
I produce two curtains pledged for two shillings on the 21st of January.
I know nothing further than I gave the duplicates to Mrs. Carlisle of the window curtains.
