I am errand-boy to Mr. Marmaduke Westwood, a cabinet-maker , in Crooked-lane : On Tuesday last, I observed the prisoner pass through and through the place several times, about eleven o'clock in the day; he then came into the shop, and took up a knife-case in his arm, and carried it out of doors; I was standing on a chest of drawers at the end of the counter; I was in a little accompting-house at the back of the shop; I ran out after him; I called out stop thief, and saw him stopped; he threw the knife-case away; I don't know who picked it up; I saw it again in the course of a couple of minutes in the hands of our apprentice.
All the property that was thereabout was your master's?
Yes.
I am a constable; I was going through Crooked-lane, I heard the cry of stop thief; I saw the prisoner with this knifecase, (producing it,) in his arms; he was not then ten yards from the house; I ran immediately towards him to say hold of him, and he threw down the property.
I leave my defence to your Lordship.
