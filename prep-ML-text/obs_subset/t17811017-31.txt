I live with Mr. Swansborough, a linen-draper , at Holborn-bridge . The prisoner came into the shop, last Thursday morning, about eight o'clock, as she had done a morning or two before; and desired to look at some silk handkerchiefs. I shewed her some. She bid me considerably less than prime cost, and by her behaviour in shuffling the things about on the counter, she gave me reason to suspect her. I looked the handkerchiefs over immediately, and missed a piece; upon which the prisoner went out of the shop, without saying a word. I followed her into the street, and brought her into a back-room, and found a piece of handkerchiefs concealed under her petticoats: Elizabeth Bailey , a servant, was present when she was searched.
He did not take it from me, he took it off the floor.
