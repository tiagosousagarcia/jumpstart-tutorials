- I live with Edward Rogers, and William Jackson , No. 49, Oxford-street : On Monday the 11th of July, between twelve and one o'clock, I received information that the prisoner had taken a piece of print from the door; I pursued, and saw the prisoner stopped about 200 yards from the door, in Wells-street, she had the print under her arm, I took it from her, she snatched the ticket from it, and I picked it up by her side.
Where was it before she took it away?
It laid outside the window, on a board.
Had she a cloak on?
No; I delivered her and the property to an officer, it had our ticket upon it.( William Jackson , an officer, produced the property, which was identified by Gathercole.)
I wrote the ticket, and put it on, this is the same.
A woman asked me to carry it for her, and she would give me sixpence, and when there was an outcry, she ran away.
