I live at No. 3, Newton's court, Round court, in the Strand , in the parish of St. Martin in the Fields. On the 22nd of October, I went out between the hours of twelve and one; I left Elizabeth Steward in the house, Catherine Marr , Mary Mead , and Caroline - , I do not know her maiden name; I came home about a quarter after one. I found the parlour windows broken and the parlour door broken open; three big drawers were taken out of the double chest of drawers, and a small drawer at the top of the drawers, were there was seven ninety pounds, eight shillings; it was in a purple leather glove.
Was this your own money
Yes, my own money.
Are you a widow
No; I have been married three weeks last Sunday.
Were you a widow then
I was never married before; I was a single woman; my name was Elizabeth Shaw, it is now Elizabeth Herdsfield.
