I am an apprentice to Mr. Horseley, a brass founder. On Saturday the 16th of December, between six and seven o'clock, coming up Fish-street hill , I saw the prisoner and two other persons take the things out of the cart. Two went on the left hand side; Hodges jumped up behind the cart and rode for the space of half a minute reaching over into the cart; he did not take any thing out; then he jumped down and went to his companions and I followed them till they came almost to Bishopsgate church; then Hodges jumped up again, almost in the same posture he was before, and took out a bundle. I asked a man to assist me to take them, but he would not have any thing to do with it. I then went over the way and told the boy who drove the cart that his cart was robbed; and the boy and I ran down Houndsditch after the prisoner, but could see nothing of him; I described the prisoner to one of Justice Wilmot's men, who said he knew him extremely well; and he was taken by Mr. Wilmot's man on the Sunday morning following.
Had you opportunity enough that night to observe the person in the cart, so as to be sure it was the prisoner?
Yes. I observed him particularly; I saw him again on the Monday; I am very sure the prisoner is the person. I had seen him at the time of the rioting and knew him again directly.
I drove the cart. The things in the bundle were my mother's; I saw them before they were put in the bundle. It was lost out of the cart.
When did you drive the cart?
I think it was Saturday night; I brought it from the Borough; I never stopped my cart till this young man stopped me. The bundle contained the goods mentioned in the indictment (repeating them.)
I know nothing of it.
