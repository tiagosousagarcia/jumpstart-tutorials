You are a partner in the house of Glyn and Company , the present Lord-Mayor ?
Yes; Sir Richard Carr Glyn, Charles Mills, Henry Parry , and myself.
Do you know of your house being possessed of a Lancaster bill, of the 3d of August?
As near as I can recollect, the 23d of October, this bill was to be sent to Messrs. Cox and Merles.
Had you seen the bill in your house?
I cannot say whether I had or not.
Then all the information you derive is from your books?
Yes.
Were you present at the time of the apprehension of the prisoner at the bar?
I was; he called me to him, and begged me to speak to Mr. Merle in his favour.
Where was that?
At the house of Cox and Merle; I went there in consequence of a note I received from them, I do not exactly recollect the answer that I made to him, but it was not such as to induce him to suppose I would.
Had you any conversation with him about the bill?
He was called into the room, and asked some questions about the hand-writing of the different clerks.
Was there any material conversation before you got to the Magistrate?
No; the prisoner at the bar was taken before the late Lord-Mayor.
Was what he said there taken down in writing?
I believe not; I cannot say whether it was or not.
You are clerk to the Lord-Mayor?
I am.
Do you remember the prisoner being brought before the late Lord-Mayor?
I do.
Was there any examination of the prisoner taken down, by you, in writing?
There was not.
If there had, of course you would have returned it?
It would have been returned.
I don't ask whether you had given the prisoner any promise of favour?
None.
Do you not know that his master, Mr. Merle, had, before he got to the Mansion-house?
I do not know.
You will be so good as inform the Court what passed, between you and the prisoner, at the Mansion-house?
After he had been charged, the late Lord-Mayor said, well, young man, what have you got to say to this; he said, he had taken the bill out of Messrs. Cox and Merle's acceptance-box.
Before he said this, what was the charge against him?
For stealing the bill in question.
Do you recollect any thing else that he said?
No, I do not.
Before he went to the Lord-Mayor he was detained at Messrs. Cox and Merle's?
Yes.
And he went directly from Messrs. Cox and Merle's to the Lord-Mayor?
No; he was not before the Magistrate that same day.
He was taken into custody at Messrs. Cox and Merle's?
Yes.
There had been some conversation between Mr. Merle and him?
Yes; and Mr. Merle came into the room in tears, and said, the rascal had confessed it.
The prisoner was not then by?
No.
On Saturday the 27th of October, I was sent for by Messrs. Cox and Merle; I went there, and after I had been there a quarter of an hour, the prisoner was introduced into the parlour, I did not know that he was charged with the robbery; when the prisoner had been in about three minutes, Mr. Merle came in, and said nothing; but presently Mr. Hallifax came in, and gave charge of the prisoner for robbing him of a Bank bill; I then searched him, but found nothing, except a few trifles, and a little cash that he had in his pocket; I then asked him where he lodged; and he told me at No. 15, Princes-street, Barbican; I then asked him in what manner I could get admittance to his apartments; and he told me then where the key of his room was to be found, and likewise, when I had got into his room, where I might find the key of his drawers; I left him in charge of the Wardbeadle while I went to his lodgings, No. 6, Princes-street, and I found the key according to his directions, hanging up under a boot-jack; and in the first drawer I opened, in a single chest of drawers, I found this pocket-book, containing two 20l. Bank-notes, one of 1l and a seven-shilling-piece, and likewise a foreign Bank-bill for 35l. upon Masterman's house, of which I took possession, in the presence of Mr. Hallifax, and another gentleman; and in a book, when I lifted up the corner, I found three guineas and a half, and eight penny-pieces; I produced them before the Lord-Mayor, I received them again, after he was committed, from Mr. Newman, the clerk of the Lord-Mayor; this bill (producing it) was delivered to me by Mr. Newman, the Lord-Mayor's clerk.
This was not found in the pocket-book?
No; I heard the prisoner say, when I had the charge of him first, that he was very sorry for what he had done, and he hoped Mr. Merle would shew him mercy; there was one of the clerks charged with the theft, and Mr. Merle said, if he had then stepped forward at the time that the other clerk was charged with it, and said he was guilty, he would have done something for him.
And that passed without any thing said by Mr. Merle to induce him to confess?
Yes.
Were you present at the first examination?
Yes.
Did he say any thing at that examination?
No; he was all the while crying, we could hardly get a word out of him.
You were sent for to Mr. Merle's house?
Yes.
Did he not tell you that, at his lodgings, you would find a pocket-book, and you would find some Bank-notes there?
He told me where the key was.
Where did you get this bill from?
I received it from Mr. Merle.
I am in partnership with Mr. Cox.
Look at that bill, and tell me if you know it?
Yes, I do.
Did you deliver that bill to Mr. Newman, at the Mansion-house?
I do not think I did, I believe it was Mr. Hallifax.
But it was delivered in your presence?
I believe it might.
You know the prisoner at the bar?
Yes; he was a clerk in our house to take care of bills for acceptance, and numbering bills for acceptance; this bill has the acceptance of Mr. Cox upon it.
And therefore must have been in your house?
Of course.
I would ask you whether you had any conversation with the prisoner at the bar relative to this bill, and when?
I do not know exactly when, but it was on a Saturday that he was taken into custody; I had another clerk in custody at that time.
This young man had been entrusted with some hundreds of pounds property of your's?
Yes, millions.
When this charge was made against him, did you not tell him you would do all you could to shew him favour?
I did; I had another clerk in custody, and there has been a person that said they thought they would know him, and they had fixed upon him, and he seemed, during the whole time of his being in custody, without fear, and appeared with perfect innocence; and it being a matter of importance to me to know who the man was, as they had such opportunities of taking property to a very large amount, I took him into the accompting-house, and told him, if he would confess whether he was the man or not, I would shew him all the favour I possibly could.
That was before he was taken into custody?
Yes.
Do you not believe, that in consequence of expecting favour from you, he ingenuously confessed it?
It gave me a great satisfaction upon this confession, when he assured me that he had never injured me but in this particular; he had thirty thousand pounds of property out with him that day; I had lent him ninety pounds that very morning to pay for furniture; he might have put his hand into the drawer and taken out thirty thousand pounds without my missing it for a fortnight; since that time, I have had all my bills marked off, and I do not find one missing besides this.
Had you said any thing at the Mansion-house to induce that confession?
No, I had not.
Were you present at the examination at the Mansion-house?
I was.
Were you present at the time the Lord-Mayor asked him what he had to say?
I was.
Had you any conversation with the prisoner then?
Not any.
I am clerk to Messrs. Glyn and Company.
This bill, that you are going to be examined to, has been in your custody?
No; I entered it in our book.
It has passed through your hands?
Yes.
Have you not given security for the deficiency of bills that go through your hands?
Yes.
Are you liable to pay for any thing you lose?
I believe so; Mr. Hallifax can say more as to that.
Are not your clerks, or their securities, answerable for any thing they lose?
Certainly; but if he had lost this bill after the clerk had entered it, I should think he was not liable.
Look at that bill, do you know it?
Yes; it was received at Glyn and Company's house; I entered the bill in our books, I marked it 22, and it appears by our books to have gone out for acceptance to Messrs. Cox and Merle's.
Does it purport to be accepted by Cox, Merle, and Company?
Yes.
Did you take it for acceptance?
I did not.
I am clerk to Messrs. Cox and Merle.
Can you tell me whether you know that bill?
Yes; I paid that bill for Messrs. Cox and Merle.
Do you know who you paid it to?
Yes; I paid it to a person of the name of William Wood.
How did you pay it?
By a 20l. Banknote.
How do you know that-by referring to your books, or from your memory?
From referring to the books.
Have you the books here?
No.
Did you desire the person to whom you paid it to put his name upon the back of it?
I did.
What else is there upon the back of it?
Warner, No. 82, Wood-street, that is my writing.
How long have you lived with the prisoner in Cox and Merle's house?
More than nine years.
Did you ever know a man bear a better character than he bore during the time you lived with him?
Never.
I am a porter in Change-alley.
Do you know the prisoner at the bar?
I think it is the man that gave me the bill.
Have you a doubt?
I have a doubt.
Do you believe it to be the man?
I do.
Look at that bill?
I received the cash for this bill.
From whom did you receive that bill?
I believe I received it from the prisoner at the bar; I was to get cash for it at Merle and Cox's, in Little-Britain; he desired me to put the cash into this cover, which he gave me; I received a 20l. Bank-note, two seven shilling pieces, and two-pence; I put it into the cover, except the two-pence.
When was that?
On the 20th of October last; he told me to take it to a person of the name of William Warner, No. 82. Wood-street; I carried it according to the direction, and delivered it to a little girl, I suppose she might be about fourteen; I told her to take care of it.
Look at that bill, and see if it has your hand-writing upon it?
Yes, I put it on at the time I received the money, by the desire of the clerk.
You are a ticket-porter?
Yes.
Have you not said, that it was delivered in the passage, and that the passage was so dark, it was impossible for you to say who it was?
Yes; he called me off my stand into a dark passage.
I believe you had so much doubt of the person, that you fixed upon another, person, who was taken into custody?
Yes, I thought he looked like the man.
And now you are only upon your belief that this is the man?
Just so.
You doubted whether that was the man, and you doubt whether this is the man?
Yes.
Do you know the prisoner?
I believe I recollect him.
Had you ever seen him before?
I believe him to be the gentleman that I gave the letter to.
Have you recollection enough to know how that letter was directed?
Yes, Wm. Warner.
And you delivered that to the prisoner?
I believe it was this.
How long ago is that?
About six weeks ago.
You were examined at the Mansion-house?
Yes.
Did you not say you could not speak with any certainty to the man?
I said, I see so many gentlemen in the course of the day, that I could not say, if he had not come down stairs and I gave him the letter.
Did you not say at the Mansion-house, that you did not know whether it was him or not?
Yes.
Did you not fix upon another gentleman that sat by the fire?
No, I did not; I said, seeing so many gentlemen, that I could not swear he was the man; at the same time I said, that was the most like the person that I gave the letter to than any body I saw there.
Therefore you will not undertake to say that he was the man?
No.
I am a banker, in Cornhill; I have known the prisoner about four or five years, he has been in the house longer; he has been in possession of very large property at times, he bore an excellent character.
I live at No. 15, Prince's Street, Barbican, where the prisoner lodged a twelvemonth; he is a very honest young man, and always kept very good hours.
