My house is in Queen-street, Cheapside, and my partner's name is James Steel; we lost fourteen pieces of linen, which I can identify.
I am warehouse porter to Messrs. Caw and Steel: On Friday, the 12th of February, I was at work in an under warehouse, at No. 78, Queen-street, Cheapside ; hearing a foot-step over my head; I went to a part of the warehouse where I could see out into our yard; I saw the prisoner run down with a bag on his back; I run after him, and asked him what he had in his bag, he said, what was that to me; I laid hold of him, and then he let go the bag; a person came up, and we took the prisoner and the bag to my master's house, and examined it, and found it contained fourteen pieces of linen cloth, which lay on the counter, in our warehouse, when I went down stairs; I can swear to them, because I marked them myself.
I am one of the City Marshal-men, and took the prisoner into custody about ten o'clock on Friday.
I have nothing to say, I beg for mercy of your Lordship and the Court.
