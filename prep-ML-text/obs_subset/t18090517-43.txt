I am a scale maker . I live at No. 18, Charles-street, Mile-end, New-town . On Sunday the 16th of April, I was sitting below stairs. About a quarter before three o'clock in the afternoon, my wife said, Dobson, there is somebody up stairs; I at last went up stairs, I got within four stairs of the top, going into the room the prisoner came from behind the door, and came down stairs; I caught hold of him, I said you scoundrel, what do you do here; he said he came there to hide himself from the press gang. I perceived something under his left arm. I asked him what he had got there, he said he had got nothing of mine; I said whether you have or have not, I will look at it; I took the articles from between his jacket and waistcoat, which proved to be an old shift of my wife's, marked A. D. No. 1; I took him to the watchhouse. When I returned, I went up stairs, and looked behind the door where he had been; I found wrapped up in this dirty handkerchief, a shirt, a child's petticoat, and a pocket handkerchief, which he had taken from the drawers. I know all these things to be mine. I can swear to the whole of them.
I had not the things about me; he would force the shift about me. I am a stranger here; I was afraid of the press-gang.
