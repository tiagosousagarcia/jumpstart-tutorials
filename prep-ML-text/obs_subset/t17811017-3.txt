I am the wife of Thomas Marshall . I live in Bloomsbury . On the 22d of September, I lost a cotton gown, two silk cloaks, and a cheque linen apron, out of my parlour. I heard somebody come into the parlour, while I was down in the kitchen. I came up stairs, and saw the prisoner going out. I ran after her, and pulled the gown out of her apron. I brought her into the parlour, and she let the other things fall.
I was passing by. The prosecutrix laid hold of me, and brought me into her parlour, and charged me with having stole the things. They lay upon the floor. I had never touched them.
