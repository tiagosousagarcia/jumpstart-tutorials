- I am a stable-keeper , and live in Park-lane : I had been out on the 30th of October about half an hour; when I went out, I left a pair of new boots hanging in the back parlour; on my coming into the house at the back door, and proceeding towards the back parlour, I heard some person; upon which, I went suddenly in, and found the prisoner in the act of putting the boots between two chairs: I asked him what he wanted; he said he wanted to speak with Mr. Fozard, and after particular enquiries, he said he wanted a letter for the hospital, as he had a bad leg, and had cut his-finger; I asked him what he was doing with the boots; he said, he had not seen or touched them; I asked him if he knew Mr. Fozard; he said, yes, perfectly, very intimately, that he was a little, short, thick, fat man, which is a description I don't answer; I thought he was a thief, and therefore took him up; I paid two guineas for the boots.
I went into the house to ask for a letter for the hospital; I told him, I hoped he would excuse the liberty I took of coming into the house; he d-d me, and said I came to steal something; I said, I had not, but for a letter which I had had before; he took me up for stealing his boots, which I had not seen; I have failed in the four quarters of the world with Lord Howe, Lord St. Vincent, and Lord Duncan, and never was charged with any offence before.
