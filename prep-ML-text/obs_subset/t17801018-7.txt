I am servant to Mr. Newson, who keeps a clothes-shop . On the 28th of September, between eight and nine in the morning, the prisoner came in and enquired for one Mr. Feereer, who keeps such a shop as our's a few doors off; I directed him. He went off the step of the door; I turned my back towards the shop door and went into the kitchen, which is adjoining to the shop; when I returned into the shop, a few minutes after, I saw the prisoner going out of the shop with a piece of cloth under his arm. I followed him crying \"stop thief!\" and Richard Bubb stopped him. I never lost sight of him till he was stopped; the piece of cloth was brought back with the prisoner.
I heard Mr. Newson's servant cry stop thief. I saw the prisoner running, and I pursued him; when I was within a few yards of him he dropped a piece of cloth from under his arm, and I picked it up. I catched him by the collar and brought him and the cloth back to Mr. Newson's shop.
There was a cry of stop thief; there were people running; a man stopped me. I am innocent.
What is the value of that piece of cloth?
Twenty-shillings.
