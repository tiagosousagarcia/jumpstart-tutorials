At the time I lost this property I was a lodger to Joshua Cunningham ; I lost this property the day after last Christmas-day was a twelvemonth: The prisoner came to lodge with me on the Tuesday before, in my room, she left me on the Monday evening after, ten minutes before six, I was out, I had left my mother and an infant, and Mary Thorp , in the room; I am positive I had left the property mentioned in the indictment in the room when I went out, and when I came home, it was past eleven o'clock at night, my mother informed me that she was gone, and she had taken her bundle; I had not seen her from that time till the 4th of this present month.
Had she given you any notice that she was to quit your lodging?
No; I expected to see her when I came back; the next morning I missed the watch, three spoons, two new cotton gowns, and two guineas and a half in gold, I never found any of my property again; when I saw her, I asked her if I could recover any of my property; I told her she had acted very wrong to me, as I had known her many years; I told her I would not give her into the hands of any Justice whatever, if she would return me my property.
Do you know any thing more?
Only from her own confession before the Magistrate.
I cannot hear that after that promise.
I am the mother of the last witness: About half after six o'clock in the evening, I had occasion to go down stairs for a penny candle, I pulled fast the door after me, and when I came up stairs, I found the door open and the prisoner gone; I never saw her since till the 4th of this month, I met her in Drury-lane; I asked her how she did, and took hold of her by the bed-gown; I said, you know Mrs. Thorp you robbed my daughter last Christmas was a twelvemonth; she gave me very abusive language, and struck me several times, and ran away from me; I called after her, and told her I wanted to speak to her seriously about my daughter's things; I intreated her to go with me, and she submitted to go home with me to my daughter's; I knew very well the property was gone when my daughter came back.
I know no more than the prisoner was delivered into my custody; I searched her, I found no property that could be sworn to by the prosecutrix.
