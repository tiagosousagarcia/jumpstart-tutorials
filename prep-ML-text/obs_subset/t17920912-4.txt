I live at Paddington ; on the 28th of August I went out of my house at six in the morning, I left my son, he is not here, I came back to dinner at twelve, every thing was then safe; I went out to my work at one, there was nobody but myself, I left no person in the house, I locked my house; I returned at four and found it open, the lock drawn: I missed nothing; I found the prisoner in the house with these things on his back; he was in the middle of the room; it is all a ground floor; a bundle laid by the side which contained two coats, a pair of breeches, and 2 waistcoats; these things are mine, they were in the house when I went out, I saw them there the night before; they were in the same room but not packed up; the great coat and the hat were in drawers; I value them as in the indictment.
I was never near the place.
