Do you mean to swear with certainty that new linen is your's without any mark to it?
Yes.
Have you any mark to know it by?
I know it by the quality of the cloth I have at home; I would have brought the other cloth to have shown you; I would not swear to it if I was not certain; I know it by her own confession.
Do you know the gown any better than you do the cloth?
I very well know that I know them both; I have no particular mark on it.
Do you swear to the gown as you do to the cloth because she confessed it; should you know the gown if you saw it in a different place?
Yes; I should know it by the make; no promise was made to her in my hearing after I had been to the justice; I told her I would not hurt her before the constable came.
