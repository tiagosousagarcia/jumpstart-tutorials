My husband's name is Charles Thompson . I lost the shirt from No. 17, Purple-lane . I do not positively swear to the shirt, the mark being taken out, nor to the prisoner.
On the 3d of May Mrs. Thompson told me she had lost a shirt; I said I saw a woman come down stairs. I went to Hatton-garden and picked her out: I saw another woman which looked very much like her; I said I did not know which of the two it was.
On the 3d of May I took the prisoner into custody; this shirt was laying on the table at the public house; I asked the prisoner how she came by it; she said she bought it of a jew. On the next day the prosecutrix saw the shirt and said there were two letters on it and the figure; they were picked out.
