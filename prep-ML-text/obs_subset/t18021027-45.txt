I am a hosier on Ludgate-hill : On the 17th of September, I was in the shop a little after three o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner came in, and asked me what he could have a pair of black stockings for, I told him, for two shillings; as I turned round to look for a parcel, he went out of the shop, saying, very well, I will call again; I looked on the counter, and missed a parcel of stockings; I followed him, and overtook him just outside of the door, and found the parcel I missed, concealed under his arm, by a bag thrown over it; I secured him, sent for an officer, and gave charge of him.
I am a constable, and produce a parcel containing four pair of stockings, which were given me by Mr. Reeves.
Being in liquor, I laid the bag down on the counter, and by mistake took up the parcel; I have had several blows on my head, which, if I drink a little, makes me insensible of what I do.
He did not appear to be in liquor.
