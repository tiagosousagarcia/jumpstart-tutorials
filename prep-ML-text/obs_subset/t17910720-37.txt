I am a Dane; I am a sailor ; I lost the things in the indictment, last Wednesday week, from a house, Mr. Westerlin's, where I lodged; it was my own bed and bedding; I saw them there when I went out, between eleven and twelve; they sent for me, and the man was taken; I carried them between ten and eleven, and put them in the back-room of the ground floor.
I was in my own house; the prisoner took the bag from out of the window; the prisoner was outside; the back of the house looks into Russell's Buildings: I asked him if that bag was his; he said, yes, it was; I said, are you sure it is; he said, yes; I sent over my daughter to ask, and they took him.
I took the prisoner, the bottom of Russel's Buildings; he had this bag.
I know this old sea jacket.
I had been working a ship out; a man met with me in the street, in a sailor's dress, and he asked me to carry that for him, for he was afraid of the press-gang; these people followed me, and said I had stole it; all the neighbours cried out, shame!
I am sure that the prisoner was the man I saw taking the things out of the window.
