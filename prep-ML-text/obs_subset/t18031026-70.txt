- I live at Britannia-row, Lambeth ; the prisoner lodged with me: On Monday, the 24th of October, she came home between seven and eight, and about half past nine I missed the counterpane, which had laid on the table; she did not return all night; the sheet was taken off the bed.
I am a watchman: On the 25th, about five o'clock in the morning, I was going off duty, and saw the prisoner with a bundle in her lap; I asked her what she had there; she said, it was her own property; I asked her to look at it; she refused, and I opened it, and found the counterpane and sheet.
I have nothing to say.
