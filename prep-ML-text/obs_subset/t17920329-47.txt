I live in Flying-horse-court, Maiden-lane . I was absent when I lost my property.
I am wife of the last witness. I was coming in about a quarter before seven in the evening; I saw a person on the stairs; I called twice, who is there? nobody answered; she passed me; and I took her with the salts in her neck; I followed her to the corner of the court; I said, lord have mercy, Poll Cooper! that is the prisoner; she begged me to forgive her; the father and mother and I have lived eight years in one house; I gave her victuals when her parents turned her out; I thought I could trust her with any thing; she has an infant child to take care of.
I am the constable. I produce the salts and the spoons: I do not know who gave them me.
I leave it to my counsel.
I have witnesses to her character.
You cannot carry character farther than Mrs. Garrick has done.
