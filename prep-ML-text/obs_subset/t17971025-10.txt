I am a labouring man ; I lodge at the Old Crown, Highgate-hill ; the prisoner lodged in the same room; I saw my property the day before I lost them, hanging up in the room; after the things were gone he did not come back to his lodgings. This was on the Tuesday; I saw him on the Friday after, and apprehended him; he had my cloaths upon him.
I am a constable; the prosecutor sent for me, and I apprehended the prisoner with the things upon him.
I took the liberty of putting them on while I got my own mended.
