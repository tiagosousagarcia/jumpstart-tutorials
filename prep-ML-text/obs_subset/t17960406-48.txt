I am one of the servants of the keeper of Newgate: I know the prisoner; I was present when he received sentence of transportation, (produces Mr. Shelton's certificate of his conviction) I saw Mr. Shelton sign it; (it is read).
I am one of the officers of the Public-office, Whitechapel: I apprehended the prisoner on the 7th of March, in a court that comes into Cable-street, St. George's; I was going along the street, he ran into a house, and I pursued him, and took him; he told me he would not go with me; I am sure he is the man.
I went out of this jail on Whitsun-Saturday; I went down with the coach to Gosport; and at Farnham they changed coaches and packages; and I was drinking there along with some ship-mates, and was left behind; they forgot me, and so I came to London.
