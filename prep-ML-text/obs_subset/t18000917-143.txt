I am a victualler , in Leather-lane, Holborn : On the 24th of July, the prisoner came in, and called for half a pint of beer; after he had drank his beer, he was going away; I told him, he had not paid for his beer; he said, he had paid me; I said, he had not, and I let him go, because I would not have any more words; as soon as he got outside the door, he ran away; I directly looked, and missed a pint and a half-pint pot; I pursued him, and took them upon him.
