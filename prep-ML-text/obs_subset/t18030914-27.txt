- I am a coal-merchant and lighterman: On the 12th of July, about eight o'clock in the evening, there was an alarm of a man robbing the premises of some lead in Nettleton-court, Aldersgate-street ; I went up the staircase, and on the landing-place, I saw the prisoner with a piece of lead covered with a cloth; I sent for an officer, and informed the churchwardens; we examined the lead, and it corresponded with the place where it was cut from; the house belongs to the parish; I tenant it of them, and pay two shillings a week; the lead was on a gutter; I searched the prisoner, but found no knife, or any thing of that kind; we afterwards found a mallet on the premises.
- I go out a washing; my room faces the place, and I saw the prisoner at the top of the house, between seven and eight in the evening, on a Tuesday, stooping in the gutter, but I could not see what he was doing; I called one of the neighbours.( Catharine Brown confirmed the testimony of the last witness.)(The lead produced by the constable, and identified.)
Wildman was sitting upon a piece of timber by my door, very much in liquor; my little boy threw his ball upon the house; I went to fetch it, and went up to the two-pair-of-stairs for my wife; as I returned from the room I saw the lead on the landing-place. I lodged at the bottom of the house.
