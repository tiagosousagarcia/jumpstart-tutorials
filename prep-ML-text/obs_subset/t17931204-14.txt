On the 14th of November Mrs. Mary Bell saw Mary Brown go into my passage, and she came over and asked me if I had been speaking to a woman in the bed room? if I had not she was afraid she had taken some thing out of the yard; in consequence of that I went after her, and I found the property on her; I found two linen shirts of my husband's, they are worth three shillings a piece, they are here, they were hanging on the second line in the yard; I know them by the mark on the bosom, they are marked J.G.B.
I saw the prisoner go into my neighbour's passage, Mrs. Lawrence's, the 14th of November, I went and told Mrs. Lawrence, and she went in pursuit of her.
I have no witness; I never took the shirts. I was going down the street to the doctress, to a woman that cures diseases, and coming up the street I met a Mrs. Jones, and she gave me these frocks, and I walked on slow, and this woman came and said, I stole them.
