I live in Walbrook . The prisoner came to my house, on Thursday the 27th of September. He knocked at the door. He was let in, and came up stair, and asked me if I had not received a letter out of the country. I said I had not. He said he had walked thirty or forty miles. I asked him to sit down, and gave him some refreshment. I had occasion to go down out of the kitchen. Going up again, I met him on the stairs. He said he was rested enough, and would go; and wished me a good day; and so did I him. About five minutes after he was gone, I missed a silver spoon off the shelf. On the Wednesday following, he came again, and asked me if I had received the letter. I desired him to sit down, and have a dish of tea. I sent for a constable, and charged him with the prisoner. He denied the fact.
As I was going with the prisoner to the compter, he said, if I would take him back to Mrs. Jones's, he would tell where the spoon was that he had stolen. He told me he sold it to one Mrs. Ireland.
The prisoner brought the spoon to me, on the 27th of September. He said he had come a journey, and wanted money, and asked me to buy the spoon of him. I said I did not want it. I sent it to be valued, to the silversmith's: they said it was worth eight or nine shillings. He said I should have it for 8 s. I gave him 7 s. 6 d.
To Mrs. Jones. How did you know the prisoner?
He had been hired to a person who had lodged at my house.
They promised me, if I would tell where the spoon was, they would not prosecute me.
