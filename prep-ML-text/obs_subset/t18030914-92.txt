On the 21st of August, about ten o'clock at night, I was going home to my lodgings in Mount-street, Grosvenor-square; I was quite sober; the prisoner came up to me, and walked up the Haymarket with me; she asked me to give her something to drink; I told her I would not, I did not want any thing with her; she followed me very close, and put her arm round my body, and when I got to the top of the Haymarket, I felt my watch drawing out of my pocket; I immediately caught hold of her hand with my watch in it; I then found my breeches-pocket unbuttoned, and my money gone; I missed a seven-shilling piece, three shillings, and a bad farthing, which I can swear to; it is a very particular one; the constable found it upon her; I never found the seven-shilling piece or the silver.
I never saw his money; he used me very ill because I told him I could not take him home with me; it was me that called the watchman.
Did you offer to go home with her?
No, I am not a man of that description.
