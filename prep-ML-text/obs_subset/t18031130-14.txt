I live at No. 38, Henry-street, Old-street ; the prisoner lives in Chick-lane, and is an unfortunate girl; I am a widow , and a weaver of gold and silver lace : On the 29th of October, between ten and eleven o'clock in the morning, the prisoner came to me, and said she had been laying in the street all night; I said, I would give her a night's lodging; my mother slept with me, and the prisoner slept on the floor; she staid all day on Monday. On Tuesday I went to work, and told her to take care of the place; at six o'clock I went back, and found my door open, and the things stated in the indictment gone; I did not know where to find her, and did not see her again till last Saturday, when I met her, and asked her if she was not ashamed; she said, she was foolish; I gave charge of her, and she told the constable where the things were.
I am an officer belonging to St. Luke's: Last Saturday evening I took charge of the prisoner; I searched her, and she had an old apron on her; I asked her for the other things; she said, she had pawned them; she said, she lived at the corner of Black-Boy-alley, Chick-lane, and if I went there, I should find the duplicates; I went there, and her landlady gave me some; I went and saw the things at the pawnbroker's.
I am a pawnbroker's shopman, and took a gown in from the prisoner, upon which I lent her five shillings.
I have nothing to say.
