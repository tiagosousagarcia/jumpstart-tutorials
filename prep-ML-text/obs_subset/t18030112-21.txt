- I am a merchant : On the 7th of December, about three o'clock in the afternoon, I was passing along Fenchurch-street , I was going from Mark-lane to my accompting-house, in Castle-court, Birchin-lane, a man followed me, and asked me if I had lost my handkerchief, he is not here; I put my hand to my greatcoat pocket, and missed it; he said, the man who had got it, was run down Mincing-lane; I desired him to follow me, and point out the person he suspected; about half way down Mincing-lane, he pointed out the prisoner, I collared him, and accused him with having my handkerchief; upon moving his coat, I perceived the handkerchief be tween his coat and waistcoat in his bosom; he had a great coat on; I took it out, and found it to be my own; I put it in my pocket, and desired him to come along with me; it was a silk handkerchief, yellow and red; it has no marks, but I believe it to be mine; I have others of the same piece- (Produces one.)
What would you give for such a handkerchief?
Five shillings; it is nearly new; I gave eight shillings for it.
I saw the handkerchief lying upon the ground in Fenchurch-street, and I picked it up. NOT GUILTY .
