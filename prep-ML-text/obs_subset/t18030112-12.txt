I work at the upholstery business for Mr. Carr, in Pall-Mall: On the 20th of December, I was going home from West-street, Smithfield , to the Strand, I saw a parcel of people standing together round an ox; I went up to see what was the matter; Mr. Read asked me if I had lost a handkerchief; I felt in my pocket, and told him I had; he had hold of the prisoner at the time; he told me he saw the prisoner tucking it in his bosom, and I gave charge of him in Newgate.
The last witness is my son; I know nothing of the transaction.
On the 20th of December, I was with Cartwright; one of the fat oxen was shewing in Smithfield, and I observed the prisoner outside the crowd putting something in his bosom; I went up to him as he was going into the crowd again, and laid hold of him; I asked him what he had got there; he said nothing; I put my hand in his bosom, and took out this handkerchief; I held it up, and asked who had lost a handkerchief; this young man then came up, and said, he had lost one, marked T. W. I shewed it him, and he said it was his.
I was with Read; I know no more than he does.(The handkerchief was produced, and identified by the prosecutor.)
