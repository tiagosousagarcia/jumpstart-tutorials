I keep a public-house , in Seven Dials; I can only swear to the property.
On the 5th of June, I saw the prisoner going out of the street-door of my house; I missed some pots; I turned her cloak on one side, and found upon her a pint and a quart pot; I had seen them on the stairs not five minutes before; I took her to Mr. Chadwick's with the pots; they had his name upon them.
