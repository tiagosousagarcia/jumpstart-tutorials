What are you?
A boot-maker : On the 31st of October, the prisoner bought a pair of boots of me, and gave me a bill upon Cox and Greenwood; I had the bill of exchange in my pocket-book all day; yesterday I went out to get some refreshment; while I was out, I lost my pocket-book, with the bill of exchange in it, and in the evening the pocketbook was left at my house by a gentleman, whom I knew, but without the bill of exchange in it.
Then the bill of exchange is not forthcoming?
No.
When had you seen this bill of exchange, before you lost it?
I had it in the Court all day, till I went out to look for Mr. Rickerby, clerk to Cox and Greenwood; I found afterwards he was in Court; I went to get some refreshment, and I missed it.
What time of day was it?
I presume, it might be three o'clock in the day.
Had you your great coat on?
Yes, I had; I was sitting with two or three friends of mine over the way when I lost it; when I went home, my wife informed me that the pocket-book was left.
Was any enquiry made of the person that returned it?
No.
Who was the person who returned it?
A person that had been in the coffee-house with me.
Did not you go to him?
I did not.
Who was it?
It was an Irish gentleman, a friend of mine; I thought it was a fortunate event, I thought the young man might be reclaimed.
You thought it right that a forger should escape in a country like this, and set with your hands before you without making any enquiry, or doing any thing to get the bill back; you have done a great injury to public justice?
If I have acted wrong in consulting my own feelings, I do not regret it.
Lord Chief Baron. Mr. Ker, I cannot help saying this has very much the appearance of a foul collusion.
