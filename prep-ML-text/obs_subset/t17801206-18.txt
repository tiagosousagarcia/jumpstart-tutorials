I was behind the house drying linen. The shop is forward where my husband worked. I saw the prisoner skipping across the door with a bundle under his arm. I looked into the shop and missed the great coat. I had seen it there but just before. My husband was out of the shop at the time. I pursued the prisoner immediately, and took him with the great coat under his arm.
I saw the great coat upon his arm. Upon being taken he threw it down.
I am not guilty of it.
