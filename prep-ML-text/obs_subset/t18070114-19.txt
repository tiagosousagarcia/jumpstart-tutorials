My husband is a broker , we live at 190, Church street, Shoreditch . On Thursday the 1st of January, about two o'clock, the prisoner came to serve me with milk, she went down as usual into the kitchen to leave the milk, I had suspicion of her when she came from the kitchen. I asked her if she had left the milk, she said she had left a pennyworth, I went down stairs, I missed a spoon, I went after her and fetched her back, I told her that she taken a spoon out of the kitchen; she denied it, I told her I was sure she had taken it, as there was nobody down there but her. She then gave it me out of her pocket; I told her that she had taken the others, but she denied it.
What others.
I had lost some before this.
What is the prisoner.
She lives with her father and mother, they are milk people.
I am an officer. I was sent for to take charge of this girl. Mrs. Mitchell gave me this spoon that she took from her, she said that she had lost one before; she denied it. I found that she had pledged a spoon the day before and took it out again. I went to the girl's father and mother, and there I found this spoon locked up in the tea-chest.
