I keep a public-house, the Cock on Snow-hill . I lost three pints and a half-pint pot on the 3d of this month. I was sick in bed at the time, and can only speak to the property.
On the 3d of this month I was at the Cock ale-house. I saw the prisoner take a half-pint pot off the table and put it into his pocket; he went out; I went after him, took him by the collar and brought him back. I searched him, and found three pint pots upon him.
I served the prisoner with two pennyworth of purl; there were two half-pint pots on the table. I saw him put one into his pocket. I waited till he went out, and then the last witness and I followed him and brought him back, and found the other pots upon him.
I picked up the pots in the street, and brought them into the house.
Is that true?
No, it is not.
