I live in Brownlow-street, Holborn ; I am a silversmith . On the 16th of July, Monday, between the hours of nine and ten, I lost two ounces and a quarter of whip tops that day William Johnson had taken from me. I went to Mr. Heather, and, in consequence of being sent for, saw those goods, and am certain they are my property; no one else in London uses these kind of articles. The prisoner was then taken into custody by Mr. Heather.
Did the prisoner work for you before?
He did; he was 'prentice with me, but was a very bad one.
