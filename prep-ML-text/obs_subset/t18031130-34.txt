I live at No. 3, Sun-yard, in the parish of Aldersgate : On Tuesday, the 29th of last month, I locked my door between eleven and twelve at night, and went into my next door neighbour's, and soon afterwards I heard I was robbed.
I live next door but one to the prosecutrix, and on Tuesday night, between twelve and one, a little girl was going out for some liquor, and saw the prisoner coming out of Mrs. Anthony's with the things; she called for assistance, and I went to her.
I am a watchman, and took the prisoner into custody, with the things in her possession.
I saw the prisoner come out of Mrs. Anthony's house that night with the property; the candlestick was in her pocket.
I was very much disguised in liquor at the time; a man gave me liquor, and told me he was going to sell those things, but I might have them; and by the same token he put the candlestick in my pocket, for I could not hold the things, and I stopped at that woman's house, where I met the child.
(To Callihorn.) Did you see the prisoner come out of the house?
Yes.
