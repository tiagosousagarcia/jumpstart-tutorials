I am clerk to Messrs. Pearkes, and Co. in Newgate-street, it is only a nominal partnership, there is no partner, he is a tobacconist and snuff-maker , in Newgate-street : On the 14th of October, I was in the accompting-house, with my back to the shop, and coming into the warehouse, we missed the truss of snuff; next morning, we were informed the prisoner was taken with the goods; we attended at the Mansion-house, and swore to the property.
You said first, it was a partnership?
It goes so, but it is not; there is no one in partnership with him.
I am an officer belonging to the City: In company with Read and another, on the 14th of October, between seven and eight o'clock, we stopped the prisoner with this truss, in Aldersgate-street; Tipper went up, and asked him what he had, then he hesitated, and said, he could not tell us, but that he was desired to go to Islington with it; Tipper asked him where he brought it from, he said, from St. Bartholomew-street; we asked him who the person was, he said, he did not know; we then took him to the Compter; I went to Mr. Pearkes, there were twelve bladdres in it.
He was driving a horse and cart, was not he?
No, he was running very fast with it on his back.
This is the property of Mr. Pearkes; I was in the shop the whole evening, but never saw the prisoner.
I leave my defence to my Counsel.
