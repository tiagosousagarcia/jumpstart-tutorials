- I am servant to Mr. Toseland; he keeps a chandler's shop in Little Britain : On the 4th of August, between five and six in the afternoon, the prisoner at the bar came to the shop for four eggs; they came to two-pence farthing, three farthings a piece; and he threw down a dollar; I told him it was a bad one; he said, it was not; I called to Mr. Turner, who was at work in the house, to look at it; I gave it him to look at, and he said, it was a bad one; the prisoner went out of the shop, and Mr. Turner followed him.
Are you sure the dollar that you received from the prisoner, you gave to Mr. Turner?
Yes.
- I am a plaisterer; I was at work at Mr. Toseland's on the 4th of August; the last witness gave me a dollar into my hand, I perceived it was a bad one; the prisoner stood close to my elbow at the time; I rubbed it upon a glass that I keep to try silver, and found it was a bad one; he said, it was not a bad one, and desired me to give him the dollar again; I told him, I would not; I then desired the shoe-maker to go to the Ward-beadle, Mr. Meek, to come and take him; he sent word that he could not come; when the prisoner found I would not give it him again, he said, well, I shall call by and by for the change then; and away he pushed out of the shop; I ran after him down as far as the watch-house; I saw him make a stoop in Little Britain, under the watch-house, as if he was dropping something; there was an open grate under where he stooped.
Do you know the house to whom that cellar belongs?
Yes; it belongs to the sexton, Mrs. Round; and the prisoner then ran up Aldersgate-street, and turned up Westmoreland-buildings; a man came up, and said, he was an officer; and at the bottom of Westmoreland-buildings, we took him; we carried him to a public-house, and searched him, but there was no sort of coin in the world found upon him; I never lost sight of him; the dollar that I had from the girl, I gave to the constable; if Mr. Meek had come, we should have taken him with all the money about him.
- I pursued the prisoner, and apprehended him in Westmoreland-buildings; I received this dollar from Mr. Turner; I made him mark it with a trowel.
I am porter to the Union Fire-Office: On the 4th of August, I was standing at my own gateway, in Aldersgate-street, I heard a cry of stop thief, and the man stopped right before me; I then went to a house in Little Britain, Mrs. Round's, where I heard he had thrown some money down; I knocked at the door, and a little girl, who lives there, said, I know what you want, you are looking after the bad money that has been thrown down here; she said, her Mistress had got the money; I went down into the cellar, to see if I could find any more, but I could not.
- I am servant to Mrs. Round, in Little Britain; I picked some money up in the cellar, on the 4th of August, at almost six in the afternoon; I was in the kitchen, and heard somebody cry out stop thief, and at the same time somebody said, he has thrown down the money into the cellar; I went down into the cellar, and saw the dollar, and then I saw the rest of the money lying by it; it was all loose; there was half a guinea, a dollar, three shillings and a farthing; I gave it to Halesworth.
- I am a silversmith.
Look at that money?
It is all counterfeit.
I went in to buy some eggs; I changed a dollar; she said, it was a bad one; I told her, I did not know it; I did not run, I walked on for near a quarter of a mile, before I knew they were after me; then they called stop thief, and Mr. Willie laid hold of me; I do not know any thing about the other money.
