I am a cheesemonger , I live at No. 83, Leadenhall street, I am in partnership with James Fitch. I can only speak to the property.
I am an officer. On the 12th of December, at six in the morning, as I was going to put my horse out, I saw the prisoner with a firkin on his head, just by Petticoat lane, it was very dark; I asked him what he had got there, what is that to you he said; I said I wished to know, he said he should not tell me. I seized him by the collar, made him put the firkin of butter down, and took him to the watchhouse. When he was before the magistrate he said he was a porter, he was hired to carry it. I wished to find out the owner of it, I advertised it; by that means the owner came to my house.
There was no concealment in this action.
None.
I am a staymaker.
Do you remember on the morning of the 12th of December being at Aldgate.
Yes, I saw the prisoner at a public house door there.
Is there any place there at which porters apply.
I believe there is.
What time did you see him there.
About seven o'clock; I cannot exactly say the time, it was between six and seven.
Mr. Solomon, what time was it you saw the prisoner.
Six o'clock, the bell had just began to ring.
What time do you usually get up.
I usually get up between six and seven; that morning I had to go to Westminster, I got up before six.
Where do you live.
At that time I lived in Sun street. I had my brother with me, I called in the Minories for a glass of brandy.
