- I live in Greenhill's Rents, Smithfield-bars , and am a bricklayer : On the 16th of December, I lost the sheets from the two pair of stairs front-room, and a cotton gown, but was not at home at the time.
My mother keeps a baker's shop in Greenhill's Rents: I was at my mother's door, on the 16th of December, between four and five o'clock, and heard Mrs. Webb call out, stop him; I run after the prisoner down a sight of steps, and caught him by the skirt of his coat, and gave him into the hands of Newton, the constable; he had two sheets and a cotton gown in his abron.
On the 16th of December, I heard a noise on the stairs, I went to see what it was, and saw the prisoner; I asked him what he wanted; he said, Mrs. Jones, and immediately run out of the house; I called out, stop him, and he was taken.
I am a patrol; Mr. Newton gave me the prisoner in charge, who begged for mercy, and said, that he was driven to it by distress.
I was going along, and heard an outcry; I turned about and saw a man running; I said, my friend, there's a woman calling after you; upon which he dropped the things, and knocked me down.
I never lost sight of him, he was not knocked down.
I am a silk-winder, and live at the top of Hoxton: I was coming from Tottenham-court-road up greenhill's-rents, and heard the cry of stop him; I then saw the prisoner laying on the ground by some steps, but cannot say how he came there. The way I came to see him again was, that a friend of mine was in Bridewell for an assault; and when I saw the prisoner, I asked him if he was the same person I had seen before.
