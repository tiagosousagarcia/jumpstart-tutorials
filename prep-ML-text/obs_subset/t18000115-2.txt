I am a publican , I keep the White Horse in Spital-fields : My house was broke open between two and three in the morning of the 28th of September; I went to bed the last in the house; I examined the windows and doors, and made them secure; I heard the dog bark, he was loose in the tap-room.
What time was that?
I cannot say; I am clear it was before four o'clock; when I got up in the morning, I found the back-window broke; the bolts were wrenched out, and the staple broke; in the morning I missed the property; part of them are here.
I am the wife of Thomas Hopwood : I lost these things; they were wet; I left them hanging on a cloaths-horse to dry. I had them again from the officer.
I am one of the officers belonging to the Police-office in Worship-street: The prosecutor had the property from Mason and me, after the conviction of a man that was tried before; I found them in the lodgings of the man that was convicted; his name was Jacob Stone ; the woman that lived with him is in Court now.
I lived with Jacob Stone; these things were brought there by the prisoner and Stone on Michaelmas-day; they were there till the officer took them away.
I never saw the woman in my life.
I had seen him several times before, at the public-house where he used.
Have you any doubt about his being the man?
No.
This is my youngest child's frock, I made it myself; I can swear to my work; and this bed-gown was a gown of mine before I made it for the child. The prisoner and the man that was cast had been in my house three hours that day, drinking beer and taking a survey of the house; and the prisoner went out into the washhouse before he went away.
What time did you get up in the morning?
About six o'clock.
It was light then?
Yes.
