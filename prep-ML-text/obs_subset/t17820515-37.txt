I am servant to Mr. Akerman. I have attended the prisoner; I never heard him speak.
Who committed him?
Mr. Sherwood. He has been about a week in our custody.
How do you make yourselves intelligible to him?
The prisoners make motions to him.
Does he seem to want for sense or understanding? or only to be deaf and dumb?
Only deaf and dumb.
Does he act rationally? and eat and drink, and behave in the common actions of life as if he was sensible?
Yes.
The prisoner lived servant with me; he boarded and lodged in my house. He was born almost next door to me. He was always deaf and dumb.
He had sense enough?
Yes; he was very ready at his business; he always behaved civil and quiet in the neighbourhood.
