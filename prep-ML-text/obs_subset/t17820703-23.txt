On the 30th of May, I saw the prisoner, in Chandos-street, with a piece of cloth in his hand. I heard a girl cry, Stop thief! upon which the prisoner ran down Castle-court. I pursued, and took him; but he had dropped the cloth. He appeared to be in liquor.
I am servant to Mr. Dolman. I saw the prisoner come into the shop, and take the cloth off the counter. I ran out after him, and cried, Stop thief! and Mr. Locke stopped him.
I am innocent. I never had the cloth.
