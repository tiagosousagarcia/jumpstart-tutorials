My husband's name is William Bell , I live in Benbow's Rents, St. Luke's.
Do you know the prisoner at the bar.
The prisoner at the bar came into my dwelling house on the 27th of March, and went up stairs and took out of a portmanteau the articles in the indictment, as she was going out of the door I saw a piece of my daughter's gown hanging out of her apron, I went immediately after her and took her, and brought her back into the house.
Did she come willingly with you.
Very willingly, but she said she had got nothing with her but her own property; the neighbours came about the door; I sent for a constable, she was searched, I found upon her a sheet, a gown, and a waistcoat, they were all in her apron.
I am a constable; on the 27th of March I was sent for, about three o'clock in the afternoon, to the prosecutor's house; Mrs. Bell took the things from her before I came, she delivered them to me and the prisoner; I produce the property. (The property identified by the prosecutrix.)
