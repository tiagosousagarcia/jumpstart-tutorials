I am an officer in the service of the customs, I found the tea on the prisoner at the bar on Saturday the 19th of December, that the prisoner at the bar and another were in the hole of the hoy that was unloading the York Indiaman, the tea is spilled out of the chests; the man that came up first I examined, I found some tea about him, and the prisoner at the bar was endeavouring to make his escape, I pursued him, and the first man made his escape, I found a quantity of tea upon the prisoner, and went and informed Mr. Twiss of it, the company gave orders for prosecution; the prisoner was employed by the master of the tackle porters to help to unload, I have no doubt he had the tea out of the hold.
What is the value of that tea?
Five shillings, that is one pound without the duty.
I was working in the lighter, a chest was broke, it was what we call the sweepings, I took it up to be sure in the dirt.
Was it sweepings as it is called?
No, clean tea; there are bags to take care of what comes from the chest.
I have no witness but God and myself.
