I am an attorney ; my wife is a worker of muslin shawls, at Hoxton ; the prisoner was a work-woman employed in our house; on the 30th of July, we missed several shawls, and several squares of muslin; in conse quence of missing them, I got a search-warrant, and went with Ray to her lodgings; she was not there, we found her in the lodgings of another woman, who worked for us, in Badger-court, Shoreditch; they searched her, and found upon her several pawnbroker's duplicates, and some afterwards in a piece of check that was taken out of her pocket.
(Produces three duplicates;) I took them from the prisoner.
I am a pawnbroker, these are my duplicates, (produces three shawls) I believe I took them in of the prisoner, but am not certain.
I am a pawnbroker in Kingsland-road, (produces a shawl) I cannot recollect who pledged it with me; it was pledged on the 23d of June, in the name of Mary Thomas .
I am servant to Mr. Dexter, Whitechapel-road, (produces three shawls, and a yard of muslin) I cannot say who it was that I took them in of; the prisoner used frequently to come to the shop.
Look at the duplicates produced by Ray, and say if they are your's?
They are.(The property was deposed to by Mrs. Grant).
