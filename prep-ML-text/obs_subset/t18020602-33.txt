I live at Cock-hill, Ratcliff , and keep a grocer's and cheesemonger's shop : On the 26th of May last, the prisoner came in about a quarter before ten in the evening; I was in the back parlour; I saw him take a piece of bacon off a stool in the shop; I pursued him and took him with it upon him.
I never had the bacon at all, it laid down at the door.
