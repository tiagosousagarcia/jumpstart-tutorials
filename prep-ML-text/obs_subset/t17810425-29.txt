I am shopman to Mr. Warmesley, who keeps a linen-draper's shop . On the 5th of April, between six and seven in the evening, the prisoner and a boy came into our shop; she said she wanted to buy some printed cotton for a bed-gown; I shewed her some; I shewed her three or four more pieces; she asked the boy what he had done with her garter? he said he had put it in her pocket; she said, she would put it on, but, she said, it was very rude to put it on before me; therefore I turned my head; in the mean while, she concealed this piece of cotton under her petticoat.
Did you turn round so as to see her do any thing?
No; I did not miss it directly; after that we bargained for three yards of this (producing it) she agreed to buy it, but had not money enough; she said she wanted a shilling; she bid the boy fetch her a shilling, and sent him out; a little while after the boy was gone, she said, she recollected she wanted four shillings instead of one, and she went after him to tell him she wanted four shillings; then I missed the cotton; I looked after her; and as she went from the door, I saw it hang about a quarter of a yard below her petticoat; I followed her as fast I could; before I got to her, I saw the watermen plying at Westminster-bridge, stop her, and take it from her: our shop is in Bridge-street, the third door from the bridge.
I am a waterman, and ply at Westminster-bridge. While I was standing in the plying-place, I saw the prisoner come out of the shop; I said to my companion, What a pity it is that woman should be about the street, she is so bad with the foul distemper! when she came a little farther, I saw a piece of cotton hanging from under her petticoat; I said to my partner, That woman has been robbing the shop; the other men who stood in the plying-place, followed her and stopt her; I saw her stopt, and the cotton taken from her; it was printed cotton, dark colour.
I have nothing to say; I have no witnesses.
