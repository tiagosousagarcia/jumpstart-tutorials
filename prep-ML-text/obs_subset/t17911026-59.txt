I sell buckles , I live in Leadenhall-street .
I was going past, and looking in at the window I saw the prisoner take a pair of buckles, and put under a bag; he took them out of the window, they were two odd buckles; I took him to Mr. Davis's other shop; there was a young woman in the shop serving him. I produce the buckles.
I know them to be my buckles.
I am a sawyer, I broke my arm some time ago, I deal in Rag-fair ; my master gave me a pair of shoes, so having a shilling or two I went to buy a pair; we could not agree, I laid my bag down, the buckles were under the bag; I do not know how they came there. I did not intend to steal them.
