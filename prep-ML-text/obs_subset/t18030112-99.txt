My husband keeps the Bear public-house, in Eastcheap : On the 7th of December the prisoner came in with two men and a woman, and said he wanted a glass of liquor, but could I give him change for a guinea; I examined the guinea, and found it a good one; upon which I gave a 7s. piece, half a guinea, and 3s. 6d. it was an old half guinea; when I laid it down, one of them said, we will not trouble the lady to change, I have got a shilling; I then looked towards my change, and saw they had put down a countersett half guinea, and taken my good one; the half guinea I saw then was quite a shining new one; I made no reply, but wishing to secure them, I went out of the bar to an officer who was in the house, and gave the prisoner in charge; the others made their escape; the prisoner said, he met them by chance, and as he had given me a good guinea, I must give him good change, for they must have changed it.
I am a constable, and took the prisoner into custody, who appeared to be intoxicated; I looked at the money he had in his hand, which was the bad half guinea and the rest of the change, and then I took him into the back room, where I expected to find the change still in his hand, but by some means he shifted the half guinea, and brought the good one forward; I then searched him, but could not find the bad one; it struck me that in pulling off his cloaths, he had thrown it into the fire; I looked there, and found it on the coals, just warm. (Produces it, which was proved to be counterfeit.)
I had been in a public-house, and had asked change for a guinea; I could not get it, and two young men followed me out, and asked if I got change; I said, no; we then went into this house, and asked for change, and one of the men said to me, here, master, here is your change, you are in liquor; I said, very well, and was taking it up, when Mrs. Wisher said, stop, that is not the same half guinea I gave you; I laid the change down again, and said, I am sure it is; then she said, it was very surprizing it was her's, and then the two men run out, and I was stopped.
