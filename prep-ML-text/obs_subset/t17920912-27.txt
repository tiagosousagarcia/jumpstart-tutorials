I keep a house in Little Pultney-street ; I lost a watch on Thursday night; I saw it about ten minutes after eight; when I first missed it, about nine, I sent my daughter to Essex-street, to Mr. Clarkson's, and I found it at Mr. Brown's, in Longacre, that is, my daughter found it; I took up the prisoner; the watch was my watch.
Did the prisoner lodge with you?
Yes; three weeks.
I carried one of these handbills to Brown the pawnbroker's, and found the watch there.
I am nephew to Mr. Brown the pawnbroker; I received this watch of the prisoner for 5 s. and afterwards 1 l.
I believe you had a very good opinion of this young man?
Yes.
An extraordinary character?
he had lived in the first families, the Duke of Clarence, the Duke of Queensbury, Lord Tankerville.
