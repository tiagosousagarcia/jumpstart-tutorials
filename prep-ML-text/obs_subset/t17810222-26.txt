I am a watchman in Smithfield, at the corner of Chick-lane. On the 12th of December, at about half after eleven o'clock, as I was standing at my box, I saw four men come up Chick-lane; one stopped at the corner; the others went forward and went down Durham-yard. I called another watchman; we both went almost to the bottom of the yard opposite Mr. Laver's house, where I met the prisoner with something on his shoulder. I took him by the collar and asked him what he had got; he d - d me, and said what was that to me, it was his own property. He threw it off his shoulder; they were ten tires of coach wheels done up in a check apron. Another man ran down the yard, some watchmen went after him but he escaped. We took the prisoner and the iron to the watch-house. Mr. Laver came and claimed the iron. The prisoner begged of him to be merciful and let him go and serve his majesty.
I went down the yard to ease myself and saw the parcel lie there; I put it on my shoulder to take it home till I found an owner for it; as I was coming out of the yard this man stopped me and took it from me.
