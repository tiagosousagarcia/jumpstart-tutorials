- I am an assistant elder in the India Company's warehouses; Mr. Lucas, one of my colleagues, discovered a deficiency in the bales of muslin; as soon as Harris was secured, I went after Topley to the armoury, and brought him down stairs; at the end of the square he told me, in the first instance he must go to the necessary, and ran away from me into the necessary; I followed him, and there I saw his left hand in the act of pulling something from the waistband of his breeches; I seized him by the left hand, and called to Mr. Evans, a commodore, for assistance; he came, and I saw a piece of muslin hanging out of the prisoner's breeches; I took hold of the muslin, and seized him by the collar.
This is the muslin I took from Topley; it is the same kind of muslin that is in the warehouses.
I have known the prisoner going on of seven years; since he has been with us, he has had the character of a very industrious man.
And I believe is one of the militia?
Yes.
I believe he has given information, by which you have recovered muslins?
Yes.
