I keep a goldsmith's shop , in Cheapside ; my shop has two counters; on the 10th of March the prisoner came into the shop, between twelve and one, dressed in other clothes, pretty decent; I had a quantity of plate on my right-hand counter, and had just cleaned a pair of butter-boats, and put them on the left-hand counter; he asked for a pair of silver knee buckles; I saw, by his appearance, that he was a little pickpocket; I told him to get out, that I had none for him; the ladles lay on a piece of leather that I had cleaned them with, and he hustled out the ladles and leather, and I walked after him; he dropped the leather at the door, and in his bosom was the pair of ladles; I brought him back again; as he came in at the door, he put them down on the counter; says he, I have not got them, I did not take them.
This is a very early period of life for you to come to this situation; it is not from any merit in you, but in compassion to your tender years, and in hopes that your morals may be corrected, that the judgement of the Court is, that you be privately whipped , and delivered: Remember now, with gratitude and feeling, the mercy that is shewn you, and do that which can only be of use to you, in future behave with honesty.
