I am the wife of Joseph Kendal ; I live in the parish of St. George; I lost a corded muslinet gown, and a muslin half handkerchief, the 15th of October, Monday, from Catherine Cotterell 's room; she lives facing the Bunch of Grapes, in Cable-street ; when I am not at work, I used to go and be in her room, and undressed myself; I left my dirty things in her room on Sunday, where I dressed myself, and went on Monday morning, and changed my cloaths between nine and ten o'clock, and I went again in the afternoon and found they were gone, and from what I was told I suspected Mary Ann Short ; the handkerchief was found at John Murray 's, pawnbroker.
Charlotte Kendall came up into my room and left this gown and handkerchief on Monday morning in my room; I went out about two or three o'clock, and left the things in the room; when I went home I saw Mary Ann Short , and she was in liquor, and asked me to drink, and I said I had no money.
What is Mary Ann Short ?
She lived in the opposite room to me, but I don't know what she is; she was very much in liquor indeed; this was between six and seven on the same day.
I am a pawnbroker in East Smithfield, I have got half an handkerchief, pawned by the prisoner on Monday the 15th of October, in the afternoon, between the hours of three and four; (produced) . I lent nine pence, on it, I am quite confident the prisoner is the person. I have known her a considerable time,
Mrs. James, did not you lend me the handkerchief to pawn it yourself?
I did not; I never saw her till I saw her to take her.
I pawned it for nine pence, and did not go back with the money, but staid and spent it; and on the next morning I found myself in the watch-house, and then she charged me with stealing a gown.
