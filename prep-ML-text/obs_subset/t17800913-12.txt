I am a bookseller at the corner of Russel-street, Covent Garden. I was robbed on Sunday the 30th of July in a street called Sloane-street , leading from Knightsbridge to Chelsea, between a quarter and half after ten at night. I was alone; it was quite dark; I was robbed by one person of my watch and about seven or eight shillings. I saw a man coming out of one of the empty houses in Sloane-street. I had scarce passed by him but he turned round and presented a pistol, and I believe he asked me for my money, but I am not certain; I was exceedingly frightened. I said, if he behaved civil I would give him what I had; I gave him both my watch and money; he behaved exceeding civil. He said, he was very sorry he was forced to take this means to get money, but it was want drove him to it. I asked him for my watch. He said, he wanted money and must have it. He said he would leave money for the watch at the Spring Garden coffee-house. I told him I did not want the money I wanted the watch. He wished me a good night; I wished him the same and he went away.
Could you discern his person at all?
I have some recollection of the person, he seemed to be dressed in a brown coat; it did not seem to be like the prisoner.
Could you see his face?
Yes; but I did not take much notice of it; he seemed to me to be a man between thirty and forty years old; I do not think it was the prisoner; I cannot pretend to say whether it is or not, but I think the prisoner is not the man.
Gentlemen of the jury there was no one present at the time this robbery was committed but the person robbed, and he says he does not believe the prisoner to be the man.
