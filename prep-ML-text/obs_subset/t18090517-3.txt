I am a perfumer and jeweller , No. 2, Bishopgate Without ; the prisoner was my porter . On the 14th of May, about nine o'clock in the morning, I asked the prisoner if on the 4th of May he did not go away from my house with some soap in his pocket, which he positively denied; I promised him pardon if he would tell me all he had done, and I would continue him in my service if he would conduct himself properly for the future. On the 14th of May I could not get him to confess; I told him if he would not hear mercy, I threatened him I would have an officer; I went with the prisoner and the officer to his lodgings, No. 4, Pell-street, Ratcliffe-highway; on the ground floor, in a box where the wife's clothes were, we found the several articles mentioned in the indictment.
When you found these things what did he say
He said nothing.
On the 4th of April I searched the prisoner's apartments; the prisoner went with us, and his wife was in the room. I found all the articles in the indictment, which the prosecutor claimed.
