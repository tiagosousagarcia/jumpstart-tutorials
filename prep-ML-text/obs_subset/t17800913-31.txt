I am shopman to Mr. Worthy, a silk mercer, linen-draper, and hosier , what is call a warehouseman, in Hanway-street, Oxford-road . The prisoner has several times come to our shop. On the 2d of August she came in between six and seven in the evening. I believed she had several times used our shop before. When she came in I was showing a customer some Irish cloth; I opened several pieces. The prisoner did not speak at all. I laid a piece on the counter; while I was showing the customer another piece I missed this piece of Irish from the counter. The prisoner was still in the shop; I was on the same side of the counter she was; I went close to her and asked her what she wanted, for I suspected her. She asked if I had any gymp or fringe? I said No. She turned round directly and walked out of the shop; I followed her into the street, between the two doors of the shop, I took her round the shoulders and asked her for a piece of Irish; she immediately said take it. I put my hand under her cloak and took it out. She had got it concealed under her cloak. She said do with me what you please, I do not care. A constable was sent for, and she was committed to his charge.
What is the value of this piece of linen?
Thirty shillings.
When I went to the shop I asked the gentleman for some trimming. He asked me what sort? I said Pink. He said he had none. When I went to buy the trimming, I wanted to buy a bit of cloth for a pair of shift sleeves; seeing him show this cloth, it was a dark shop, I took it to the door to look at it; the gentleman followed me out and said I wanted to take it away.
Did you see her look at it?
No, she had it concealed under her cloak.
