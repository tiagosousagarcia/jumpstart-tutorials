I live at Chelsea , at a public-house. I lost a linen gown last Monday evening. I had seen it, half an hour before it was missing, in a bed-chamber. I left it in a box that was not locked. I afterwards received it from a Mr. Rush.
I am an hostler at the same public-house where the prosecutrix lives; and knowing that she had lost a gown, I pursued and overtook the prisoner, in company with a woman. The prisoner turned back, and denied twice or thrice that he had the gown. I insisted upon his going with me. He unbuttoned his waistcoat, and gave me this gown.
I had been to Chelsea: coming back I met a woman, that I believe is a woman of the town. I went into this house, and called for sixpen'orth of brandy and water. I went up into a room with her; I do not know what she did there. I took the gown from her, and came away with it, as she had cheated me out of all my money. I thought they might be pursuing me on account of her gown.
