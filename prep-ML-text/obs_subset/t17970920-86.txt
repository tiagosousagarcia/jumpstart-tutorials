- I am a shoemaker , in Ludgate-street ; the prisoner at the bar was a carpenter at work at my house to plane some cutting-boards, such as we use in the business; I know nothing of the circumstances attending the robbery.
These were square pieces of leather, cut for the purpose of soles?
Yes; they were squares of leather.
They are to be converted into soles; they are not soles till they are cut to the proper shape?
Yes, they are.
Your men might cut them into heels?
No, they never do.
- On the 19th of July, about half past eight o'clock, I was at work in my master's shop, and I perceived a light shine through a hole at the top of the stair-case that leads into the leather cellar; I was afraid something might be on fire, and I put my foot down one stair; I stooped and looked through a hole, and saw a man's arm with his shirt sleeves tucked up; I told my shop-mates I believed the carpenter was there; we suspected him, and when he came up, we searched him, and found eight pair of men's leather soles in his apron, under his tools; he had done his work, and was then going away.
Were they not mixed with other leather after they were taken from the prisoner?
No, they were not; they are Mr. Soames's property; Mr. Blow wrote upon them at the time.
- I am clicker to Mr. Soames; I saw the property found in the prisoner's lap; I marked them when they were taken from him; these are the same.
I went into the cellar to get a knife to use as a screw-driver, and when I came up the leather by mistake was amongst my tools.
