I am a washerwoman . I had these things to wash. I hung them up in the yard belonging to my house, on the 3d of July last. I saw them there at half an hour after nine o'clock. They were gone at ten.
I heard a cry of Stop thief! I saw the prisoner running, with a bundle under his arm. He dropped the bundle. I followed him. I knocked him down. He struggled much, and scratched me; but I secured him, and brought him back to the house from whence the things were taken, and delivered him to the constable. He tore my hair, and bit my arms.
Coming home from Moorfields, I saw two men, who were crying out, Stop thief! I saw a man in white. I said, There he runs. I went to lay hold of him, and the fellow threw the things at me; and then this gentleman catched hold of me, and said I was the thief.
