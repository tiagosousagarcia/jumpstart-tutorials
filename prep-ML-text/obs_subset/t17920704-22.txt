I am wife to Hugh Biddick ; I lost four table-cloths in the evening of the 28th of June.
I went on an errand, and on my return I saw a man coming out of the house with a bundle upon his arm; I ran to my mother and alarmed her; when I went out the things were safe, when I came back they were all gone.
I heard the alarm of Mrs. Biddick. I followed to the corner of Bryanston-street; I saw three men at the corner; the prisoner ran up Orchard-street, and I pursued; then I met him in Somerset-street.
I live at a publick-house. I saw the prisoner and two men lurking about the house; I thought they were upon no good, and I watched them, and I saw the prisoner have a bundle; then I saw them at the corner of Bryanston-street tying up the clothes.
