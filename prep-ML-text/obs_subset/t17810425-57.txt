I am a cordwainer . I was coming from a customer of mine at half past ten at night. At the beginning of Holborn, I met with the prisoner; she asked me if I would give her a glass of wine, or any thing; I had no objection; we went into the Vine Tavern; I had eighteen-pennyworth of punch, and in a few moments I catched her hand in my breeches-pocket, and she pulled out two or three shillings, but she returned them to me again; she pleaded poverty and distress: she said she had a child, upon which I gave her one of the shillings back again; I put my hand into my pocket, and put the remainder of my money into my coat-pocket out of my breeches-pocket; in a few minutes after, I put my hand into my coat-pocket, and missed my money, which was two half guineas in gold, and twenty-one shillings in silver; I charged her with taking it; she strongly denied it; she said she had no more than that one shilling I had given her. I called the landlord; the landlord told her she had better deliver it me, for she had been guilty of such crimes in his house before; she still declared she had not; I then charged the watch with her; I took her to the watch-house, and charged the constable of the night, John Godfrey , with her; he found two half guineas, and twenty-one shillings in silver, upon her.
I searched the prisoner; I found two half-guineas and this silver (producing them)
That money is my own property; I had it when I went into the house; I had been to see my nurse, to pay her, that afternoon, for nursing my child; she was not at home; I had it in my pocket-handkerchief; the man saw I had it. He gave me first a shilling, and then half a crown. I said I would not have any connection with him for all the world, for he had the evil in his neck; then he pushed me; I pushed him again; he said he had met with such bitches as me before, and abused me.
