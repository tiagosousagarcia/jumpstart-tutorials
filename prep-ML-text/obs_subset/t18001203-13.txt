- I am in partnership with my brother, William Ravenhill; I can only prove the property.
- I was going through Whitechapel on Saturday evening, the 1st of November, about twenty minutes after five; I was passing by Mr. Ravenhill's; I saw the prisoner and another with him; I heard the prisoner say to the other, cut upon that; I stopped, and then I heard him say, he could not get at it; the prisoner at the bar then said, snatch it; he then snatched some printed cotton; I pursued him, and took him with the property upon him; I delivered it to Mr. Ravenhill. (Mr. Ravenhill produced, and deposed to the property).
Mr. Miller ordered me to take it home to his house, and he would buy it of me.
(To Miller). Is that true?
No.
