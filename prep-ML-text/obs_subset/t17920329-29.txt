I am wife of John Lewin ; he is a coachman . I was robbed of the things in the indictment; I was going home; I was in Green-street, Grosvenor-square , about seven at night; I think it was the prisoner; I run after him, and was very nigh taking him, but a man came and hit me a blow on the back of the neck, and pushed me against the wall; I continued the pursuit, and the prisoner was taken in ten minutes with the bundle, in North-row; he threw the bundle over the pales; he was never out of my sight till the people surrounded him; but I could not swear to his face, because I never saw it; he snatched the bundle off at once.
Nothing passed before?
No. I know the things to be mine; some of the silk was dropped, and found by a man in Green-street; and one piece is missing.
I took the prisoner in North-row; I saw him throw the bundle over the pails; this is the bundle.
