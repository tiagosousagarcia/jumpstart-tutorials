My Lord, the prisoner at the bar came to me in May last, at Shacklewell; he was very destitute; I took compassion on him, and kept him five or six days. I work in the brick fields ; I went out to work at four o'clock, and left him in bed. He came to me at six o'clock; I gave him the key to go and fetch some pieces of iron hoop to make a fire-place; he staid an hour and a half; I went after him, and found the key of the door in the door, and I missed the things. I found him at West End; he had my breeches, shirt, and handkerchief on his back. The constable took him with the clothes on.
I took him into custody; he confessed the taking them away. I took him before Master Montague.
I worked at the white-lead mills, at Hoxton , I asked him to lend me some clothes, to enable me to get a place; I met him some time after as I was coming to town to make him satisfaction, and he took me into custody.
