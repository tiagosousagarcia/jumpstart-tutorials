Passing through John-street , in the Minories , on the 28th of February, about four in the afternoon, a gentleman stopped me, and told me my pocket had been picked. I had used my handkerchief not two minutes before; I found it missing. I pursued the prisoner; I was informed he had picked my pocket; I overtook him in the Minories; I stopped him, and took my handkerchief out of his pocket.
I am a constable; I saw the handkerchief taken out of his pocket.
I did not steal the handkerchief; I picked it up in the street, and put it into my pocket.
