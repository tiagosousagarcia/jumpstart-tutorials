I keep the Swan with Two Necks, in Lad-lane : I can only swear to the property.
I am chamberlain to Mr. Brewer: On the 22d of July, the prisoner came in about twelve o'clock at night, and asked for a bed; I lighted him to bed, and he paid me for it, one shilling and sixpence; when he was gone, we missed the curtains; there had been nobody in the room besides myself, it was a double bedded room; there was one curtain gone from each bed; I saw them again on the 25th, at Guildhall.
I am servant to Mr. Brewer: I can only prove the property.
I am a pawnbroker's servant, (produces the curtains) I cannot say who pledged them; the person that took them in is not here, he was not before the Alderman.( William Kimber , the constable, produced the duplicate, which he deposed to have found on the prisoner; and the property was deposed to by the prosecutor, and Berry.)
I never was in the house in my life. GUILTY .
