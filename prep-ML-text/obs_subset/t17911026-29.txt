I saw the doors and windows secure on the night of the robbery, I made all safe. I went to bed a quarter after eleven, my fellow servant was up after me, that is the prisoner. I did not hear her go to bed. I arose about a quarter after six, I heard no alarm in the night, it was the 7th of October, it was light. I observed the pantry window was broke open; it was a sash, the bottom pane of the bottom sash was broke; the sash was put up again, and the shutter shut to, a person might thrust down their arm, and open the window; I saw no marks of violence, only I found a little blood on the shutters. I missed the things in the indictment, they are my master's property; I saw them a quarter after eleven in the pantry, that was a good distance from the window, but in the same room. The things are here. I did not know the prisoner before, I was footman, and had been about ten weeks. The things were found at the pawnbroker's, I was not present.
I was sent for by Davis, the pawnbroker, on the 8th of this month; the prisoner was at his shop, I searched her, and found these things on her; I said nothing to her, either that it would be better or worse. She told me she broke open the house; I asked her if she had any accomplices, and she said no.
I never told him any such thing.
I am apprentice to Mr. John Davis , I saw the prisoner at the time, I apprehended her; she came with a table cloth, and asked 18 d. then she produced a pap spoon; we were apprized of the robbery, and I told my master, and he sent me to Mr. Andre.
What is the value of these things?
I cannot say; I knew the prisoner very well, she was not employed by me that I recollect, her sister lives with us now, her name is Mary, the prisoner had been a servant.
I have nothing to say, and no witnesses.
