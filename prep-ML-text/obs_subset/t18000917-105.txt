I am the wife of James Moss , my husband is a watchman , a labourer at Hackney : On the 6th of August, I had laid in a fortnight; the prisoner came into the room; I awoke, and thought it was my husband come home from duty; I saw the prisoner lying upon a suit of cloaths of my husband's, that she had taken from the drawers; I called my child out of bed, to go to the guard-house for a patrole, the patrole came, and took her at Homorton Terrace, just by where I live, I saw her going out of the room with the things, and I had hold of her, but she got away from me; I had left the door upon the latch for my husband to come in; the prisoner was quite a stranger to me.
Young James Moss came to me at the watch-house; in consequence of which I went after the prisoner, and found her at Homerton Terrace, with these things upon her. (producing them)
These are my property.
I had had nothing to eat for some days, and had a drop of drink, and how I came into the house, I do not know; I don't remember any thing about it.
