On the 16th of June I lost the things in the indictment; the maid-servant saw the boy running out of the garden, and I saw him throw the plate from him; he might then be about a hundred yards from me; he ran from me, but he never was out of my sight till he was taken; I saw him taken.
I saw the boy go out of the garden-gate, I did not see him come into the house; I seeing him run, asked the man-servant if any boy had been in; he said, no; I directly went into the parlour, and missed the plate; I saw him drop the plate; it has been in my possession ever since. (Produced, and deposed to.) The boy was never out of my sight till he was taken.
