I live at Mr. Pickerings, No. 125, Cock-hill, Ratcliff , nearly opposite Mr. Hooper's shop: On Saturday the 16th of this month, a quarter before nine o'clock at night, I had some information, in consequence of which, I ran over to Mr. Hooper's shop; when I entered the door, I perceived the prisoner coming from under the slap of the counter, with eleven silk handkerchiefs in his hand.
Were there any body in the shop besides?
Nobody at all; I seized him and took the handkerchiefs from him; Mr. Hooper entered the shop, and I delivered the handkerchiefs to him; the prisoner begged for mercy, and said, if I would let him go, he would not do the same again; an officer was then sent for, and he was taken into custody.
I keep a shop opposite Mr. Pickering's, at Cock-hill.
Is your shop a part of your house?
Yes.
You have a house entirely to yourself?
Entirely; on Saturday the 16th, I went down into the cellar, I was not absent more than four or five minutes.
Did you leave any body in the shop?
No; I heard a violent noise, I ran up, and found the prisoner in the possession of Cooke, who gave me a parcel of handkerchiefs, which I knew to be my property.
Whereabouts were they lying?
In the shop window, upon the stall-board.
Were they in one piece?
No, they are separate handkerchiefs, of different forts, (produces them;) I have kept them ever since.
Do you know them to be your's?
Yes.
These are the same handkerchiefs that I delivered to Mr. Hooper; I put my mark upon all of them.
I do not know what to say.
