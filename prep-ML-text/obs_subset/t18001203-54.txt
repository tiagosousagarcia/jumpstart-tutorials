I am the wife of John Churchill; I live at No. 4, Goodman's-yard, in the Minories : On Wednesday, the 26th of November, about three o'clock in the afternoon, I went up stairs into my children's bed-room, up two pair of stairs, and found the prisoner behind the door; I saw him putting a bundle behind a box; I asked him what business he had there, and he said he came to enquire for James Gregory; there was no such person lived in the house; I asked him what he had put behind the box, and he said nothing.
Did he attempt to go away?
No.
Was there any body there besides yourself?
No; I untied the bundle, and found my husband's hat and my bonnet tied up in a handkerchief, that was not mine; I told him he had taken them out of the box; he said he had not; the bonnet was in the box, wrapped up in a handkerchief, and the hat was hanging in the room; he had taken the bonnet out of my handkerchief, and wrapped it up in his own; I know the bonnet to be mine.
How did you get him secured?
He ran down stairs, and got away; as I was by myself, I was afraid to do any thing to him: on the Saturday after, my little boy saw him go into the Black-horse rendezvous, and by that means he was apprehended on the Sunday; I am positive the prisoner is the man.
I know this hat to be mine by the lining.
I keep a green-grocer's shop in King-street, Tower-hill; Churchill called upon me to assist him in apprehending the prisoner; I went with him, and brought the prisoner before the Magistrate.
I belong to the Marine office; I assisted in apprehending the prisoner.
I went up stairs to enquire for one James Gregory; a boy that stood at the door told me to go up there; I did not meddle with the things.
