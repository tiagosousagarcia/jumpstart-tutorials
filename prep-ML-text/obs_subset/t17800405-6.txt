I live at Newington in Surrey.
Are you in partnership with John Whitfield ?
Yes. I was at my warehouse, where some things were upon view, prior to an auction. My boy came down, and said he had seen a man put three pair of stockings into his pocket; I bid him point the man out. When the prisoner came down the boy said he was the man. I stopped him, and searched him, and found three pair of stockings in his pocket.
Were there any marks upon the stockings?
No. I cannot swear to them.
I saw the prisoner put three pair of stockings into his pocket, and informed my master of it, they were found in his pocket.
A gentleman asked me to go and see Mr. Wheeler's sale; I went there. The gentleman went from one place to another; he gave me these stockings to put into my pocket. Mr. Wheeler asked me if I had any of his stockings in my pocket? I said no. I gave him the stockings I had in my pocket, but I did not before know that they were Mr. Wheeler's.
