I am a Custom-house locker: I was stationed at Mr. Lingham's warehouse, on the 7th of September, it is situated in Lower Thames-street ; the prisoner was a labourer at work in the warehouse, it is a coffee-warehouse; I saw the prisoner come from the back part of the warehouse, and he said he was paid off; what, says I, are you paid off before dinner; says I, what are you come here for; he said, he went in there for his jacket, or his apron, and I told him I must examine him befor he went out of the warehouse; I rubbed him down the side, and felt something hard inside of his breeches; I asked him what he had got there; and he said it was a little bit for his own use; I told him he must take it out; he begged of me to let him go; I told him I could not do any such thing; and he took it out of the fore part of his breeches, (produces it in a small bag) it is exactly as I took it from him. I here is nothing but coffee and cocoa in that warehouse, the heads of the coffee casks are many of them open.
How much is there of it?
Upwards of two pounds; I am no judge of coffee, but in my opinion it is very iferior.
Is it worth sixpence?
I cannot pretend to say.
Who is the proprietor of the warehouse where the prisoner was labourer?
I am.
Do you know any thing of coffee-whereabout is the value of these two pounds?
It is a good deal damaged; it is worth about sixpence, I suppose.
Coffee is deposited in your warehouses under the King's lock?
Yes.
I went into the warehouse and put my coat on, I found it concealed under my coat, upon the head of the cask; I concluded, when I saw the officer, that he would, of course, accuse me of it, and I endeavoured to conceal it between my thighs, and he searched me and found it there.
