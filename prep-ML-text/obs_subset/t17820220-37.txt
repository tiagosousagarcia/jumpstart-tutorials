On Saturday last, Ann Brunin and another person came into our shop, and asked to look at some gold rings; I am apprentice to Mr. Fleming, a pawn-broker , opposite the Play-house, I shewed some rings, she took one and said it was too big, I shewed another, she asked for another, and while I was weighing the second, she found means to conceal the third, Mr. Halliburton was sent for, he searched her, she had the ring on her finger, and a brass one in her pocket; I am positive it was my master's, there is a mark, but no hall mark; it has a particular mark, I took particular notice of the ring.
It got on my finger by mistake, instead of the brass ring.
