I am the wife of John Burn, I am a boot and shoe maker , No. 4, New-court, Rope-maker's-alley : Last Tuesday, after dinner, I heard a strange foot coming down stairs, as I thought, and I sent out my daughter to see who it was; she said, a person had turned the corner; I sent my boy up stairs to see if any thing was gone, and he missed some boot-legs; I went out to see if I could see any body, and as I returned, I met the prisoner with the boot-legs and things in her apron; I asked her, what she had got there, and she said, they were all mine; there were two pair of boot-legs and vamps, a waistcoat and a frock; she dropped them on the ground, and I picked them up; she went away, and I called out for help; two men pursued after her; I brought her back, I am sure she is the person.
I am a constable;
I know these things to be mine.
