- I am a coachman : On Sunday evening, I saw the prisoner coming out of the coach-house, and go behind the door; I asked him what he did there all that time; he said, he got there, that the head ostler should not see him going to sleep in one of the losts; I locked up the coach-house door, and put my coat in; I put the light out, and felt in my pocket, when I missed my handkerchief, gloves, and tobacco box; I then got a light, and went to the stable again, when I found a coat, waistcoat, a pair of breeches, a pair of overalls, and a pair of shoes, gone; it was not above half an hour after I had hung them up in the stable; I found the shoes upon him, and the handkerchief wrapped round his foot, on the Monday.(The things produced and sworn to.)
My Lord, necessity and starvation compelled me to do it; I was brought from Ireland by an American gentleman, and have no friends in this country.
