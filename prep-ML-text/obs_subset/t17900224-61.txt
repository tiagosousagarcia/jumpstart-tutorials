I am a merchant . On the 2d of February I was walking through Bell-court , and all of a sudden I thought something catched my coat, though I neither heard nor saw any body; I turned myself round, and saw the prisoner going away through Bell-court, into Cornhill, walking; I cried out, stop thief! he was stopped: I never lost sight of him; the street constable asked me what was lost; I told him, I lost my handkerchief; I stepped up to him, and he gave me the handkerchief.
I am the street-keeper of Cornhill; I saw the prisoner give the handkerchief to Mr. Brewer and Mr. Brewer gave charge of him.
