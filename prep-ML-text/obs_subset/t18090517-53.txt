I live at No. 56, High Holborn ; I am a shoemaker ; I have two rooms, a shop, and a back room. On the 10th of May, a little after nine o'clock at night, I was sitting in my back room, I saw something moving from the door but I could not perceive what it was; a boy ran from the shop across the street, I ran after him to see him; he was standing at a shop that was shut up, he said what do you want; at the instant a pair of shoes dropped from him; I picked up the shoes; he said forgive me, this is the first thing that ever I did in my life; I asked him who was with him; he said no person, and he lived in George-street in the Borough; I took him to our shop in order that I might know him again, and then I took him to the watchhouse,
