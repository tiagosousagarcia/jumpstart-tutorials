On the 26th of April I was sent for to take a woman of the name of Davis into custody, and I found the prisoner in her company with a bundle in her lap; I asked her what she had got there; she said it was nothing to me, they were her property; she then said they were a pair of sheets that she had fetched from Westminster; she said they were the sheets her father died in, and I had nothing to do with them; I took her before a Magistrate, and she was committed for further examination; Mr. Day heard of it by some means, and he applied to me.
I live at No. 16, Moor-lane ; I keep a cook's shop : I lost a pair of sheets on the 26th of April, from the garret bed, where two single men lodged; the prisoner used frequently to come to my house with her husband; the sheets were taken at our dinner hour, about half past twelve; I saw the same sheets in the possession of the constable; these are my sheets; there is no mark upon them, but I have got the fellow to one of them here.
I picked them up, tied up in a red pocket handkerchief, the corner of Coleman-street, at four o'clock in the afternoon.
