I live at No. 59, Walling-street ; on the 4th of October, I lost nine pieces of wild-bores from my warehouse; about half past five in the evening I was in my compting-house, and heard the bell tingle; I went into the warehouse and missed two rolls of wildbores: I went into the street and saw the prisoner not twenty yards off, returning; he had one roll on his shoulder; I pursued and took him: they are here. (Produced). This is mine.
A man offered me a shilling to carry it to Billingsgate.
