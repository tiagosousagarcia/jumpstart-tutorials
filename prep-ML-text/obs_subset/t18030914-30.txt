- I live at No. 17, Baker-street, Westminster : The things were in my box on the 4th of August; the prisoner lodged up stairs over me; they were found on the prisoner.
I produce a shirt and pocket handkerchief, pledged by the prisoner on the 4th of August.
I apprehended the prisoner, and found a shirt in her cupboard.
I have nothing to say.
