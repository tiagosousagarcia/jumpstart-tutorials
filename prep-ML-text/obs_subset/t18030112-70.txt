- I am a butcher in Newgate market : On Saturday last I lost a piece of beef; about ten or eleven o'clock at night the prisoner and beef were brought to my door; I know the beef by the cut ad quality; I examined my stock, and found a piece had been taken from the corner of the block at the sront of the shop; it is the sore ribs, and weighs 78lb. value 39s. (The bees produced and identified.)
I am servant to Mr. Mellish; between ten and eleven on Saturday night, as I was going along, a gentleman told me a piece of meat was stolen off the block; I ran through the market, and heard the cry of, stop thief; I saw the prisoner running, and another man; the prisoner was running to hide himself; I took him back to my master's shop; I did not see any meat on him, for he was runting from it.
On Saturday night I saw the prisoner pass my shop very close, in company with another man, who had a knot on his arm, or a sack and large coarse cloth; they went past Mr. Mellish's, which is within four or five yards; they came back again, and I never saw the other man till he was taken, and who was discharged before the Alderman; the prisoner walked backwards and forwards for ten or twelve minutes; during that time he lifted up a rump and chump of beef of Mr. Mellish's twice; presently after I saw him at the end of Mr. Mellish's block, laying on his stomach, and dragging this piece of beef; I saw the other man take it, and go away; I immediately called out to Mr. Mellish's people; I am positive the prisoner is the same man I saw dragging it; the beef was dropped on the ground a few yards from the block.
I am a staymaker, and left my work at eight o'clock; I went to market, and walked backwards and forwards to see what I liked; I heard the cry of, stop thief, and run, and they took me, and used me ill.
