My husband is a waterman ; the prisoner came to us as an apprentice on liking; he was only with us a week: On Sunday afternoon, the 4th of July, I gave him liberty to go to his uncle's to get some clean linen; he came back about half after nine at night; our eldest apprentice came home about the same time; they had their suppers; my husband and I had our suppers, and went to bed about half past ten, after seeing the fires all out; about six o'clock the next morning, the eldest apprentice, James Arnold, came to the room, and desired me to get up, for he was robbed.
Were they your husband's things or your apprentice's that were taken?
They were my husbands, he finds them all in clothes; I got up, and went to look for the prisoner, and found him in the Borough, with part of the things upon his back; I took him to Mr. Brown, the constable.
I am an officer; I took charge of the prisoner; part of the clothes I found upon him; he directed me to a public-house, where I found the rest.
I have nothing to say for myself.
