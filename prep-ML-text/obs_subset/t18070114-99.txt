I am the wife of Daniel Schultz . I lost a washing tub, and two pails on the 12th of December. I live at No. 7, Harrison's buildings ; I put the tub and pails into my shed; I went to look for them on Saturday morning, and they were gone. On Monday I saw the tub to be sold in King David lane, at Mr. Barnes's; I knew the tub to be mine, I never saw the pails since. The prisoner lived in the same court with me.
I am a carpenter. On the 12th of December, about seven o'clock in the evening, the prisoner brought the tub to me, and one pail. I gave her three shillings for them; I sold the pail before I knew they were stolen.
I was going along in the evening, the gentleman stopped me and asked me if I did not sell him a pail and a tub, I told him I knew nothing about them; he said I have got your description, and you must be the person; I went willingly to the office.
