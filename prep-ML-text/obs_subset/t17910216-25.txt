I live at No. 1, Flower de Luce-court, Fleet-street, the 31st of January, Monday evening, about twenty minutes past eight, I saw the prisoner standing at the corner of Chancery-lane , with three other young men; I was with Mr. Stapleton and Mr. Holmes, we were walking by, we had a suspicion of them, the prisoner run across the way, and appeared to have something under his arm; there was a coach standing, I saw the prisoner open the coach-door and take something out, and make a plunge to get away; I took him round the waist, and said, what have you here? and I saw something fall, and I bid Stapleton pick it up, and put it in his pocket, I saw him open it; there was in the bundle, a shawl, and a letter wrapped up in a newspaper; the prisoner was taken to the watch-house, I went with them; then Mr. Stapleton and me went to Mr. North and enquired for the owner of the carriage, and we found the lady to whom the shawl belonged.
At this time of night there was a good many people passing?
Yes.
It was rather darkish?
Yes.
I leave it to my counsel.
