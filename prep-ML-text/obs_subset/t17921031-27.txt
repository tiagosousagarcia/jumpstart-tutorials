I am a stationer ; I was sent for to Bow-street, to ascertain the property; I believe them to be mine; they were marked by my wife, but we have so many that I cannot positively swear to them.
I am a pawnbroker in Long Acre; I produce five pocket books, the prisoner brought them to pledge on the 10th of October, and asked me half a guinea on three of them; I stopped her, I sent for an officer and took her to Bow Street; she said she had them from abroad, I suspected they were stolen; there was one found in her shoe.
I produce eight pocket books, I was sent to search the prisoner's box; she was a servant to the prosecutor, I found them in her box the prosecutor was in the room.
I saw them taken out of the box.
The prisoner was left in the shop on Tuesday the 9th of October; while Mr. Middleton and his brother drank tea; I can swear to two of the books, I believe them all to be mine, I had not sold either of them; I was not present.
I left the girl in the shop on that night; the pocket books were in drawers without locks.
I leave it to my Counsel.
