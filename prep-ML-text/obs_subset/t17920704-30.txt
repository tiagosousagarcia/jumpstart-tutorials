I lodge with Mr. Flexney; I do not know his christian name: I heard a great screaming in the passage; I ran down stairs and saw the gentleman at the bar with my plate in his pocket. I sent for a constable.
I live in Jermyn-street ; between eight and nine in the morning of the 22d of June I seized the prisoner at the street-door with the property.
I am the constable, I produce the spoons; I have kept them ever since; the prisoner was taken to Bow-street.
I leave it to my counsel.
