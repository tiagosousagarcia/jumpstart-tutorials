I am the wife of Edward Lambdin , a tailor , in Skinner-street, Bishopsgate-street : On Saturday the 8th of December, I lost a cap, the prisoner was an acquaintance of mine, and if she had not been very much in liquor she would not have done it; I found my cap on the Monday evening: on the Saturday I had put it on the table, and she asked me to let her have some halfpence to get something to drink; I said, I thought she had had enough; she went away, and when I came to put on my cap in the evening it was gone; she was very much in liquor indeed.
- I am servant to a pawnbroker, (produces a cap) I took it in on the 8th of December, from the prisoner at the bar. (The cap identified by the prosecutrix.)
I was as sober as I am now, it is all spite, I will not excuse my prosecutor; I asked her to lend me some halfpence, and she said she had none; she gave me the cap to pawn, and when I had pawned it I received a shillingsworth of halfpence for it, and she followed me and knocked me down; she knocked the halfpence out of my hand and set me a bleeding.
(To Mrs. Lambdin.) Is there any truth in this story?
Not the least.
