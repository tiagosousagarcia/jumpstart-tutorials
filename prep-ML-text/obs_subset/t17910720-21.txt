I am the wife of Christopher Ibbetson : I missed the articles in the indictment on Saturday the 11th of June, about ten in the morning; I did not see the prisoner take them: the prisoner used to work at days in the house at times; she had worked that day; she is a chare-woman ; I imagine some were taken from the laundry, and some from my bed-room; but the way I missed them was by getting all my linen together, and looking them over.
I am a servant to a pawnbroker; the prisoner has been a customer to our shop; I knew her perfectly; she pawned with me eight table-cloths, &c. I know nothing of the tumblers; they were pawned at different times; the first table-cloth was pawned the 16th of April, and the last the 2d of June; there was a sheet and table-cloth pledged the 21st of May, a tea-spoon the 26th of May; I gave the things to Mrs. Ibbetson.
I produce the things which I took from the pawnbroker's, and have kept them separate ever since.
I had been very ill, and when I got well I went to work for Mrs. Ibbetson, and she did not pay me very well, and so I could not pay my debts; she owes me 20 s. now; I meant to take the things out of pawn, and replace them, as Mrs. Ibbetson had paid me.
