On the 12th of this month, I was beating a carpet near Bayswater, by the turnpike, about seven o'clock in the morning; I left my great-coat at the Three-compasses, Orchard-street, Portman-square ; I came back there between four and five in the afternoon; my coat was there then, and between seven and eight I saw it in the prisoner's possession, and I took it from him.
I was at the Threecompasses, on the 12th of this month, the prisoner was there; I saw him take a handkerchief out of his pocket and lay it upon the table open; then he took the coat off the peg, and put it under the table, it was a coat belonging to the last witness; I'endergrass came in and saw it, and took it from him.
I was forward in liquor, I know nothing of it.
