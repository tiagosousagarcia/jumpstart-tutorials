I am a pawnbroker in Ratcliff-highway: On the 22d of January the prisoner brought two hats to pledge, but knowing him to be an old offender I stopped him, and sent for a constable, and I found the owner of the hats.
I live at No. 89, Ratcliff-highway , I am a hatter : I had lost two hats on the 22d of January, prior to Mr. Mitcham\\ send\\ ing to me.
Is there any private mark on them?
One has got my name on it, the other has not; I believe them both to be mine; they are both the same sort of boys hats that I lost that evening.
Was the prisoner in charge when you went to him?
Yes; the prisoner signified then that a woman gave them to him, and she was to give him something for pawning them.
What is the value of the two hats?
Two shillings and sixpence.
I was coming from my work with my tools on my shoulder; I met a woman that asked me to pawn these things, and she said she would give me a shilling, so I went into this pawnbroker's shop to pawn them, and he said he would not take any hats in to pawn.
