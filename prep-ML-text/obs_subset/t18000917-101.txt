I am a tin-plate worker , in Hog-lane, Shoreditch : On the 13th of this month, in consequence of information, I missed a milk-pail from my door, it wanted about a quarter of two o'clock; I followed the woman, and overtook the prisoner with a milk-pail; I took her into custody, and delivered her to Mr. Harper.
On the 13th instant, I met a woman with a single milk-pail; I was coming to work from dinner, and I told my master of it; he missed one, and he went after her; he found her with it, and delivered it to the constable.( Samuel Harper , the officer, produced the pail, which was deposed to by the prosecutor).
I saw a woman with a child in her arms, with this pail, and the child was crying; I asked her if I should hold the pail for her, and then this gentleman came up, and I saw no more of her.
