I am a breeches-maker , in Basinghall-street ; I lost several little articles at various times; on the first of this month, I discharged the prisoner; after that, from information I received, I went to Mr. Thompson's, in the Cloysters, a taylor, and found three pair of braces.
I am a taylor; the prosecutor claimed three pair of braces which I bought of the prisoner at the bar, he told me he made them himself; the officer took them from me, I think it was about three months ago; I have bought two or three times of him, so that I cannot tell exactly the time.
I have had them ever since; I had two pair of them of Thompson.
There is nothing particular about them, but I can swear to the work of the holes; they are worked by a woman I employ.
Before Smith went to the Grand Jury, he said he did not wish to find the bill, but he thought they would circumvent him in his trade.
Is that true?
They asked me many different questions, and I did not know the nature of it; I thought he might go about so the shops.
I worked these holes in these two pair of braces for Mr. Smith, I cannot tell how long ago it was.
I worked the holes in this pair of braces.
I worked for the prosecutor as long as I could get any money for wages, and I was obliged to pawn my cloaths; I bought this webbing to work over hours, to maintain myself, I could not get any money of him; I got me a fresh master, and therefore he took me up; I made some of those button-holes myself, and he owes me now above a guinea of wages.
Do you owe him any wages?
No; he owes me one pound, and seven-pence halfpenny.
Has Smith paid you your wages regularly?
Yes.
Does the prosecutor pay you your wages regularly?
Yes; every Saturday night.
Does he pay his work-people regularly?
Yes; I never heard any complaint of any body.
I saw him make the slings that were brought to the Court at Guildhall.
Take care what you say, girl, look at them?
These are not the slings that were brought forward there, these are not his making.
