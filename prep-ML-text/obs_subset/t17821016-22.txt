Coming through Temple Bar about twelve on last Sunday night, making the best of my way to Tower Hill, the prisoner catched fast hold of me, and pulled me on the side of the bar against a china shop, and she put her left hand into my right hand pocket, and took out six single shillings and a half crown piece; I found my money was gone, and I said to her, you have robbed me; I heard the money chink in her hand.
You did not know what she had taken from you till you felt in your pocket?
No, Sir, then I saw her give the money to another girl, and I took her to the watch-house.
Was she alone?
No, there were two behind her.
She did not demand your money?
No, she said nothing, but pulled me against the side of bar.
How do you know what money you had in your pocket?
I was sure of it, it was in my breeches pocket.
How came you to let her put her hand in your pocket?
I was frightened, I did not know what she was at, and seeing the others, I expected to be knocked on the head.
Then you did not hinder her from putting her hand in your pocket?
She pulled me against the bar, and put her hand in my pocket immediately, and the other girl made off.
My Lord, I never saw the gentleman till he catched hold of me.
