I live at the Saracen's-head, Snow-hill , and have apartments in the yard: On Thursday evening, the 28th of January, some stannel wearing-apparel was taken from me, which was hanging up to dry in the gallery; advertisements from the Public-office, mentioned a person being stopped with such articles; I applied there and saw my waistcoat and drawers.
I am servant to Mr. Mountain; I saw the things in the gallery a quarter before nine in the evening, of the 28th of January, and a quarter after nine I missed them; I know them to be my master's property.
I belong to the Police-office, at Westminster; on the 29th of January, in the morning, the prisoner was hawking clothes about to sell; I took her into custody, and asked her where she got them; she said, she came from the Isle of Wight, and brought them with her.
I came from the Isle of Wight, with three small children, and another woman, in the waggon; she had the care of both her bundle and mine; she left me, and was to meet me near the Abbey; I wanted victuals for my children, and went to sell what I thought was my own, but instead of leaving me my bundle, she left me her's, with these things in it.
