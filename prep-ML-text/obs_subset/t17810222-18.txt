I am a butter-factor . On the 25th of January I employed one Peter Dobey to carry four flats of butter from Oxford-market to Newgate-market, to deliver to one Mr. Thomas Fellows , a salesman; I called on Fellows about ten o'clock; he said he had received but three flats; that one was lost. I was informed the flat of butter was found on the prisoner and that he was taken to the Compter. I went there and saw him.
I was employed by Mr. Garfield to carry four flats of butter for him in a cart to Newgate-market. I loaded them myself as I was to carry them. I left Oxford market about a quarter after five in the morning and got to Newgate-market a quarter after six. In Newgate-street I took down the tail board of the cart and took one of the flats to carry to Mr. Fellows; I left three in the cart. When I returned to the cart I missed one of the flatts; I ran directly towards Newgate; I met a man and boy; the boy said there was a man going along with a flatt on his shoulder. I pursued and overtook the prisoner with the flat; I took it off his shoulder. He said there was a man behind him who was to give him part of a pint of purl to carry it to Spitalfields.
Did he show you the man?
No; as I took the flat off his shoulder he turned to run towards Giltspur-street, I laid hold of the flap of his coat and secured him; I delivered
the butter into the possession of a constable; it has since been sold but the flat is here.
Going along Giltspur-street, I saw a man with the butter flat; he asked me where I was going? I said to Spitalfields; he said he was going that way, and if I would carry it part of the way he would give me some purl; when the man stopped me he ran away. I am a white-smith; I have no witnesses.
