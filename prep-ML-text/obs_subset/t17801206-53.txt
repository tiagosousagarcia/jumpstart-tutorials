I am the wife of the prosecutor. The prisoner came to our house on the 6th of November, to lodge in the one-pair-of-stairs room. On the 10th of November there being some workmen in the house. I put my shoes and buckles in his room on the bed; he was at home that afternoon backwards and forwards. I came home about ten o'clock, and sent the maid into the room for the shoes and buckles. She said she could not find them. The prisoner was then in the parlour; she saw a hat under the bed, which had been in the box before, and the lace stripped off; I suspected the men who had been at work, and would have gone after them, but was advised not; and the prisoner in particular, put his hand upon my shoulder and advised me not to go after them. That night about ten o'clock, I went up for the child's gown, which was kept in an open drawer in his room; that was gone. I went up stairs to to a band-box, where the cloaks were kept; and they were gone. I came down and said I believed they would take every thing in the house; and wished to bring them to punishment. The prisoner said, if you took the persons and got the things again, I dare say you will not punish them. The next day I suspected the prisoner; I had him taken up. I went up stairs with him; and he said, if I would have patience he would give me an account where all the things were; and I found them at several pawnbrokers.
On the 11th of November, the prisoner pawned two tea-spoons with me, and between that and the 22 d, all the other things mentioned in the indictment (producing them) I I believe the prisoner is the man, but will not swear it was the prisoner.
I have nothing to say in my defence; I have no witnesses.
