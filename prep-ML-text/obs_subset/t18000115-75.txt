I am servant to Mr. Brown, a pawnbroker : On the 23d of November, the prisoner came to our shop, and produced a duplicate of a watch for five pounds, between five and eight in the evening; he said he wanted his watch out; I fetched the watch, and produced it to him; I laid it on the counter, and the prisoner took it up and wound it up; he said he wanted to look at some gold chains; I asked him to settle for the watch first, and then he might go round to the fore-shop to look at them; he said he would rather look at them where he was; I took the watch off the counter, or out of his hand, I cannot say which; I went to fetch him the chains, but when I came back with the chains he had altered his position, and placed himself opposite the watch; I had moved the watch farther up the counter; I shewed him some chains; he said there were others in the window that he liked better; and I went to fetch more, and while I was gone he ran out, and I missed the watch; I pursued him and took him.
Who is the owner of your house?
Mr. John Brown.
Has he any partner?
He has none.
He is a pawnbroker, and you are his servant?
Yes.
What may be the value of it?
I cannot say; there were five pounds lent upon it.
