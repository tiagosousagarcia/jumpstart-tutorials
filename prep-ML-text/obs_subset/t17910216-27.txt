On the 10th of this month I was in my kitchen backwards, I thought I heard somebody in my shop; I turned round, and saw the prisoner take up a leg of pork, and he went out; I pursued him four doors down our lane, and I touched him over the shoulder and said, my friend, you had better come back and pay for that leg of pork; he said, I am only going to take it to my brother to shew him: I brought him back, and at the door he dropped the leg of pork in the dirt, and fell on his knees, and asked for mercy; I told him no mercy I would shew, for I had been robbed many times; I took the prisoner and the pork to the compter, and then took the pork to Mr. Newman's house.
I am a constable, this leg of pork was left at my house by Mr. Foulkes.
I was in great distress, and had not a bit of victuals for the days; I have three motherless children and never was guilty of any thing of the kind before.
