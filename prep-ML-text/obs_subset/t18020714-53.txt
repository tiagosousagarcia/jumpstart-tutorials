I live at No. 45, Marshall-street ; the New River water runs into the house, conveyed into a water-tub by a leaden pipe that runs through the kitchen from the main pipe; it stands by the back of the stairs, near the kitchen; it had a brass cock fixed to it; this pipe was fixed to the house: On the 30th of June last, I observed at six in the morning, that the pipe and cock were safe; I was sent for to Marlborough-street; on my return, the pipe and cock were gone; it appeared to have been cut off.
I live at Mr. Saunders's house; I saw the prisoner standing against the water-tub at the bottom of the kitchen stairs, about six in the evening; I asked him what he was doing there; he said, he had got a sister in the house; I said, if so, you have no business there; I saw him with the pipe in his hand under his coat; he instantly laid it down, and ran up stairs; the cock was fixed to the pipe; he was stopped in the passage by a little boy; in a few minutes after, I carried the pipe and cock up stairs, and gave it to a woman who was in the house; but I know not to whom, through the hurry; I do not remember ever to have seen the man before.
Is not the house you speak of a lodging-house?
Yes.
On the 30th of June, I was going to the Haymarket; there was a great row at the door of Mr. Sauncers's house; I found the prisoner in the house, and took him in custody; some person gave me this pipe; it appears to be wrenched off, as the two parts exactly answer.
