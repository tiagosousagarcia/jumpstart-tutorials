I keep the Crown, Lincoln's Inn-passage . On the 28th of January, the prisoner came in and called for a pint of beer, which he paid for, and in going out of the house a person called to me and said, that man has got something; I followed him to Lincoln's Inn, and I said, my friend, what have you got? he says, I have paid for the beer, what do you want? I said, I did not agree for you to take the pot. I took him back to my house and took the pot from him.
Have you any doubt that it is your pot?
No.
Did you examine him when you took him back whether there was any pot missing?
He said, when I took the pot out of his pocket, if I have got it in my pocket somebody must have put it in. I sent for the constable and gave him charge of him.
The pot was put in my pocket. They asked me if I would go for a soldier? I told them I was not fit for it.
He had down another pot, a pint pot, and an old tin quart pot, what we warm the liquor in, and we could hardly get it out of his pocket.
What did you do with the pot?
The constable has had it ever since.
This is the pot, Mary Emery gave it to me, I have kept it ever since.
This is my pot.
You did not give the constable the tin pot?
No.
I was in this public house and had a pint of beer; there were some men in the room, they asked me if I had any money in my pocket? I said I had as much as I wanted. I staid there some time on account of the weather; they asked me if I would go for a soldier? I said, no I was lame. They must have put the pot in my pocket, I know nothing about the pot.
I asked him how such an old man as he should do such a thing? he said he was guilty of it, and was sorry for it.
