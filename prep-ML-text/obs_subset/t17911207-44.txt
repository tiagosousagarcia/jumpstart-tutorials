I keep the Chapter coffee-house ; the prisoner came on the 19th of November, and asked for a glass of wine; I had cautioned the waiters against taking any bad money; the prisoner said he was my neighbour; when I charged him with a knowledge of its being a bad one, he came up to the bar, and snatched away the first sixpence; then he threw another away; I had him set down in the box; and these two, which I have in my hand, I found under him; one of these sixpences is the one which was first tendered to me.
I am a constable: I searched the prisoner; I found one shilling, a half-crown, and one sixpence.
I am a moneyer of the Mint; these two sixpences are both bad; the half-crown and two shillings are bad: there is one good sixpence.
I sent the constable to the person from whom I received this money: he said he would come, and set all to rights; but he never came.
