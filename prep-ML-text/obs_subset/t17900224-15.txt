On the 24th of January I had been to Islington; when I came to Moorfields , between eleven and twelve, I saw the prisoner, a man, and another woman; the prisoner called me back, rather in liquor; I asked her what she wanted with me; while I was speaking to her I missed my pocket handkerchief; I charged her with it, and threatened her with charging her with the watch; she immediately gave it me; I then went to the Two Brewers, London Wall, and told them I had been robbed; and they went out with the watch, and found the woman in the same place, where she took my handkerchief, and they searched her, and found my neck-cloth upon her: I was so much in liquor that I had not missed my neck-cloth.
How came you to miss your handkerchief, and not your neck-cloth?
I do not know how that was, but she gave me my handkerchief: I went and drank with them all at the publick-house; the girl and I was talking together five or six minutes together, from the other two; then I missed my handkerchief; then we went to the publick-house door, and she went in and brought some gin to the door; I gave her the money to pay for it.
This young man came to our house on the 24th of January, and told me he had been robbed in Mooorfields; he was very intoxicated: I went to Moorfields with him, and I heard somebody cry out Nell; and the prosecutor said the prisoner had robbed him of his handkerchief and neck-cloth; she denied it; I went to search her, and she pulled the neck-cloth out of her pocket, and dropped it; I saw her drop it: he did not know he had lost his neck-cloth, till I told him.
I am a constable. The prisoner was brought in with the prosecutor and another; one had the handkerchief, and the other the neck-cloth: the prosecutor was drunk: he accused the prisoner with having taken money out of his pocket; and if she would give him the money, he would freely forgive her; she owned to taking the handkerchief and neckcloth.
I did not take any thing except the eighteen-pence which he gave him; three of them wanted to lay with me whether I would or not.
