I work in the wine trade : last Tuesday night I was going from my master's Piccadilly, to Spital-square, for three dozen of wine; I pitched it at the corner of Brown-street, Seven-dials , and unfortunately a hackney-coach passing by knocked my hamper down off the pitching-block; I took up the hamper, and went into a public-house to see what was broke, and there was only one broke; I took my hamper out again, to take it on the pitching-block, to put it on my head; the prisoner came to help me on with it, under a pretence, and he picked out some of the bottles, but I could not tell how many then, till I counted them; I took one from him, which I have here now; the hamper was tied down with cords, but no cover; he took another out, but I took the first from him, and he told me he would knock me down if I would not let him have it, and I seized him by the collar and called for assistance, and two constables seized him: there were two bottles more that I could not find; there was another with him.
You say there was one other with him; where did you see the other first?
In the public-house where I went in; he helped me up too; I catched hold of this; he escaped.
On Tuesday, about five o'clock, I heard a man calling out, Murder, and thieves! they were robbing him at the corner of Hog-lane; I ran up, and saw the prosecutor get hold of the prisoner, with the wine-bottle in his hand; I took the wine from him, and took the prisoner before the magistrate.
I was drinking where this man was; I went out; he said, my friend, will you let me have a hand; I did; his hamper fell down again; he turned himself about, and said, I wish your head broke, you d - n'd rascal; you want to rob me: I was paid off the Ardent.
