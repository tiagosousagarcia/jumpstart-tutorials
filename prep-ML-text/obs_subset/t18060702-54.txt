I am the wife of John Horwood , I lost my gown on the 7th of June, it was taken off a pole from a two pair of stairs window, I did not see her take it, I only know by a person who saw her take it, I had not left it on the pole ten minutes before it was taken, and at the time it was taken I was in my own place.
I am a pawnbroker, No. 66, Long Acre, I produce the gown, I did not take it in of the prisoner, it was pledged by her daughter on the 9th of June.
I am an officer, I went to the prisoner's lodgings, Short's Gardens, I searched and found the ticket of a gown pledged for eight shillings, I found the sleeve belonging to the gown, I took her in custody; I produce the duplicate, I found it under her arm pit.
I take in washing, I took that gown of Mary Mays , I have washed for her two years; I told the prosecutrix if she would go with me I would go after the woman and find her; she was at my house, I told her my husband was coming home to breakfast, she stopped all the time my husband was there, and she sent out for something to drink, she said she would not hurt me; when my husband was gone she locked the door, and would not give me liberty to go, I asked her over and over, and she would not then let me go; I have three small children, I am an innocent woman.
How came you by the duplicate.
This woman was in my place on Saturday, and asked me to let my daughter pledge it for her.
