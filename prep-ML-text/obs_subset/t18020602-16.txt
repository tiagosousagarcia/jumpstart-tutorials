I am a baker , in Bunhill-row; the prisoner was my servant : On Monday, the 13th of April, 1801, I sent him out, as usual, with his bread and with his weekly accounts; he requested change for a one-pound note, for a customer of mine, of the name of Gray, saying, he wanted it to discharge a bill; I gave it to him, to the\\ amountof twenty shillings; he did not produce the note; he went away, and I saw no more of him, till he was apprehended; he never returned the note, money, or basket, nor any of the monies he had received that day; I apprehended him last Friday fortnight; I took him in bed, at his master's house, a baker, in East-Smithfield; the officer awoke him, and took him to the watch house; he there told me he hoped I would have mercy on him.
I never was guilty of the like before or since; I hope you will have mercy; I should not have acted so, but I was in liquor, and was ashamed to come home again.
