I keep a chandler's-shop and coal shed , King-street, Seven Dials : On the 14th of this month, between eight and nine o'clock, I heard a noise in the coal shed with the fowls; I immediately went down the passage, I found my back door unbolted, and left open to the street; when I entered the coal shed, I saw the prisoner at the bar at the fowl's roost, with her hands lifted up to them; I looked on the floor, I observed a piece of carpet which was not mine; I took it in my hand, and there were two fowls wrapped up in it quite warm; I took her to the watch-house, I produced the fowls at Marlborough-street, they were my property.
My mother sent me of an errand, and as I was going along I rushed against a drunken man; I was afraid of him, and went into that gentleman's house, he went backwards in the yard, and came out again, and said I had killed two of his hens, and brought a piece of carpet to wrap them up in; while he and his wife were talking together, some women came down stairs, and one of the women said it was her carpet, and then they sent me to the watch-house.
