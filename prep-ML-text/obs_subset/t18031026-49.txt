I am shopman to Mr. William Gillman , linen-draper , Barbican : On the 8th of October, about twelve o'clock, the prisoner came into the shop to purchase a gown; I observed her to shuffle about her cloaths, and as she was going out of the shop, her cloaths seemed to stick out a good deal; I followed her, and brought her back; as I brought her up the steps, the print dropped from under her petticoats; a gentleman passing by, brought it in; there was another shopman, Mrs. Gillman, and a customer or two in the shop at the same time; it was taken from the shop counter.
Some of the persons in the shop might have seen her take it, for any thing you know?
They might.
I am a clerk in the house of Dimsdale and Co. On the 8th of October, I was going along Barbican, and saw the prisoner drop a piece of calico at Mr. Gillman's door; I took it in, and it was claimed by Mr. Gillman.( John Mills , a constable, produced the print, which was identified by the prosecutor, as having his private mark upon it.)
I am innocent of the charge.
