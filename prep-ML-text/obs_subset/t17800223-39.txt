I live at Hendon . I saw the gloves upon the compter. I had looked at them before, and because they were moth-eaten I took them up and tied them in the manner they are tied now, and hung them to the fire.
I am the wife of John Buckingham . I lost a cloth cloak on the 30th of October.
Where from?
It was a new cloak; it it was stolen out of the shop.
Have you any reason to know that the prisoner took it?
It was found upon his wife's back the morning that we took him up for stealing the gloves, and brought him before Sir John Fielding . Sir John Fielding 's men took the cloak off his wife's back. I missed it on the 31st of October. It has a particular fur on it, and in sewing the ticket to it, I cut a nick with the scissars.
Did you ever see it in the prisoner's possession?
Never.
