The prisoner came into my parlour with some more, and the prisoner came out, and was leaning over the bar door, and I saw him take a pint pot off the shelf; he appeared to put it into his breeches; I saw the mark of the pot in his breeches when he was in the parlour; he came out and paid me for the beer; I followed him and asked him what he had in his breeches, he said, my handkerchief; I got a constable.
I was coming out of Barbican, and the prosecutrix gave me charge of the prisoner; I took him into the parlour, he took the pint pot out of his breeches; I saw him, and took hold of him before he clapped it down; the pots were shewn to the prosecutrix, and delivered up to the constable; he claimed them as his own.
I am constable; Mrs. Weaver came down to give me charge of the prisoner, and she told me the prisoner had taken a pint pot; I found in one pocket a pint pot, and in the other a quart pot; the prosecutrix claimed them; I have had them ever since.
I am a taylor ; I went to carry a suit of clothes; there was an odd ten-pence; I agreed to spend it; I was very much in liquor; I went into another house with an acquaintance; I went to sleep, and the person went away; I never saw the pots, nor knew where I was, till I found myself the next morning in Wood-street Compter, nor should I have known where I was the next morning till I asked what strange place I was in.
I did not see that he was in liquor.
