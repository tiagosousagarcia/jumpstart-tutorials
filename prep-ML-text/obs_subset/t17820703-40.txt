I am servant to Messrs. John Townsend and Thomas Compton , who are pewterers . The prisoner was a labourer at my masters'. While he was oiling some pewter, I saw three ingots of grain tin lie under the place where he was at work. When he went out, I missed them. I told the foreman, William Wakeland , of it. He followed him, and brought him back; and the three ingots were found upon him.
I am foreman to Messrs. Townsend and Compton. Upon the information of the last witness, I followed the prisoner, when he went from work, on the 24th of June. I brought him back, and found three ingots of tin upon him. They were concealed under his apron.
I am sixty-five years of age. I have lived in London thirty-eight years. I was never called in question for any thing in my life, I have no witnesses. I was always a clear man, thank God, before this time; and then I was very much in liquor.
