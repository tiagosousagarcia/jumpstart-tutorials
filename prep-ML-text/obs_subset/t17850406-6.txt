This lead was stripped off from Mr. Adams's house in the Circus, near Portman-square , the back part of my house faces the back part of those buildings; my wife saw a man go into the buildings, and in about ten minutes after, I went and secreted myself in the buildings, I staid there an hour and better, when I heard them bring the lead from the outside of the house, and put it into the inside, I got up the chimney, and staid three quarters of an hour, the prisoner came past me with a load of lead on his head; I let him go past me, and followed him, and caught sight of him, and the witness Durham seeing a man with something on his head, stopped him, and threw the lead off his head, in the mean time I came up to him, and he was secured, there was near an hundred weight.
Do you know where that lead came from?
The next day we went and matched it to the buildings; it came off the dormer part of the roof, the garret window is on the roof; I am sure it fitted there.
What are you?
I am a carpenter, I have leave to work in the house.
I had been seeking for work; and coming by between seven and eight o'clock, I heard a great noise at the top of the house, I stopped to hear it, being so late in an empty house, I heard a man come and bring this lead down, and he put it at the door, and I took the lead upon my head, and I thought I would take it home and go to a constable, and have the men secured, and when this man took me, I told him there were the men upon the house, and he went himself to see, and he said the men were there when he went, but they went away while he was there, and took more lead with them.
Have you any body to speak for you?
Nobody but a woman.
What business are you?
I am a painter, I had my discharge out of the marines in the Chatham division.
