I live in Wood-street ; I sell old clothes . On Wednesday morning between eight and nine, the 9th of February, I went out for a roll; the goods hung in the window; when I came back, the prisoner at the bar was the outside of the parlour door, with the things in his lap; I asked him what he wanted? and he answered, she, she; and he had the gown in his hand, and a painter's brush; I laid hold of the gown, and called assistance, and no one came; at first he opened the door; I called out, and Brookes came in and took him.
What part of the house do you live in?
In the lower part of the house; the door is always shut.
I am a stonemason; I was going home about eight o'clock: I heard Mrs. Payne cry out murder and thieves; I saw the prisoner come out of the house; and I took him, and gave him to the constable.
