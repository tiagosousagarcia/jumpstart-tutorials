I am the wife of John London , a neighbour told me there were thieves.
I am an hostler, I was going across Little St. Martin's-lane, I heard the cry of stop thief! the prisoner was stopped; I have had these things ever since they were taken from the prisoner.
The two stockings and bed gown are mine.
I was crossing West-street, I heard the alarm of stop thief, a soldier and a sweep chimney took me right.
