I am a labourer in the East India warehouse : I live at No. 70, Lambeth-street, Goodman's fields ; I keep the house; the prisoner is a shoemaker ; he lived near me; I charge him with stealing a silver watch, on the 3d of this month; the watch was hanging under a glass in a back room; I saw him in the house, and heard him call in the street a person of the name of James Clay , that was a lodger in my house; after that, he came to the foot of the stairs, and there he called James Clay , the second or third time; my wife, rather before three o'clock, went to see what o'clock it was, and then I missed it; I thought immediately that the young man who came into the house must have taken it.
I produce the watch: On Sunday, the 3d of February, Mr. Pool sent to me, and I took the young man into custody in the evening, about seven o'clock; after he was locked up, I told him I should go after the people where he had been, and take them up; he said, do not do that, for he had left it there, I might go and ask Mrs. Luxham for the watch that he had left there, I went there, and Mrs. Luxham gave me the watch directly; he had been drinking tea there, with a young woman of Kent-street, in the Borough.
Where did you get that watch from?
John North came on the 3d of February, about half-past three o'clock, and left that watch.
The same watch that you gave to Smith?
Yes.
I was going to call James Clay , my bed-fellow, and found the watch on the outside of the threshold of the door.
