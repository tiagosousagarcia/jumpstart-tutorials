I am a publican in Clipstone-street, Fitzroy-square . On the 24th of April, about ten o'clock in the morning, a girl came and told me that a man had taken two pots out of my barrow; I pursued the prisoner and seized him; I took him to the house and found two quart pots in his apron; they had my sign and the same of the person that I took the house of; they were appraised to me.
I did it for want.
