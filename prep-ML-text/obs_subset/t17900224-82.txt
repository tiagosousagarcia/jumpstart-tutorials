I am a servant of Mr. Warre's, and a watchman; I saw the prisoner come down Chapel street, about half past nine, on Saturday the 6th of this month: I took the young fellow, and gave a charge on suspicion the lead was not his own: I got orders from Justice Walker's; supposing it came from Squire Warre's.
Did you ever compare it with the lead that was missing?
I cannot tell rightly that it fits the place.
I am a servant to John Henry Warre , Esq. in Queen's square ; on the 6th of February there was some lead missing from the house, on Saturday.
Did you see the lead safe on the 6th?
I did, on the 7th it was gone.
From what part of the house?
The area, from the front of the square; it was a leaden pipe, twenty feet three quarters; there was a man taken that night; which to all appearance was like that lead.
Have you ever seen that lead, and compared it with the lead taken from the prisoner?
No.
Is there any body here that has measured the lead and the wall?
No.
