I am a married man. I was calling clothes about twelve at noon, in Buckeridge-street, St. Giles's ; the prisoner called me; she had some old clothes to sell; I went up, and there were five women in the room; and the prisoner shewed me a white bed gown, and asked four shillings for it? I said that wont do; then the prisoner said you have no money, and she took me by my throat with one hand, and with the other hand she took two shillings out of my breeches pocket; after that they threw the chamber pot over my head; then I went down.
Are you sure that is the woman that took your money?
Yes; I saw the two shillings in the prisoner's hand; I went and got an officer, and when I came back I found her in another room; I took her before a magistrate, and she was committed.
I keep a lodging-house next door to Thomas Casey 's house; I know nothing of the robbery, but I saw the Jew come down very wet; my husband and I went to the justice's with him.
