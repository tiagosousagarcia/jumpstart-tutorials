On Sunday week, the prisoner came into St. Michael's church, Cornhill ; at the end of the prayers he went out, and having some suspicion of him I followed him, and after he had got out, I heard a noise like the rattling of branches, in the cloister; I went towards the place, and found him concealed behind one of the pillars; upon seeing me he threw down this branch, (producing it) ; he went into the street, I followed him, and laid hold of him, several people came to my assistance.
On the 15th of this months, I was at church, I heard a noise in the cloister, I went and saw him in custody of the last witness, and being a constable, as I was conducting him to the Compter, I discovered these two branches, partly in his breeches and partly under his coat.
I am one of the church-wardens, I know nothing of the robbery.
