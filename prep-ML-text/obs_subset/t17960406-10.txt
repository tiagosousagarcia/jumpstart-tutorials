I hired the prisoner as my livery servant : On Saturday the 19th of January last, he went out to distribute some visiting cards, and he never returned again; the next morning all his livery was missing.
I am butler to Mr. Denys; The prisoner quitted Mr. Denys' service on Saturday the 19th; he was employed on that day to distribute some cards; it was after nine o'clock that I quitted the house; he stayed behind me; I was obliged to go; upon my return from the opera, with my master, and Captain Palmer, I found he was not returned; he did not return at all; I sat up till past one o'clock on Sunday morning; at half past eight I made a search, and missed the articles specified in the indictment; I found him afterwards at Woolwich, on Tuesday the 22d; I had heard that a person of that description had been about the Warren; I employed a constable, and he was taken up; he was then in regimentals, at drill, in the light artillery; I said, Thomas, I am sorry to see you in this situation; he said, I am not sorry at all; if you take me to London I shall soon return; upon that, his brother fetched the plain cloaths that belong to my master, which he has on now.
Had you said any thing to induce him to confess?
Not the least in the world; he signified that these were the cloaths that he took away from Mr. Denys; at the Marlborough-street office he acknowledged they were my master's.
Was it those cloaths that he has on, that he said he had taken from his master?
Yes.
Where they his own livery cloaths?
Yes; and there was a new pair of boots, that I believe were Captain Palmer 's.
Had you given those cloaths to your servant, or no?
By no means; he had only worn them about three months.
They were made for him, I suppose?
Yes.
It may, perhaps, be too much to say, that a man going away with his own cloaths that were made for him, can amount to felony.
