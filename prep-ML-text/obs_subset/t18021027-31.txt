I am a soap-maker and perfumer , in Holywell-street, Shoreditch ; the prisoner was my servant ; I had suspicion of him, and on the 15th of September; I stopped him, as he was going home from work, at seven o'clock in the evening; the officer took out of his pocket about half a pound of carraway seed, of the value of 2d. then we went to his lodgings, and found a quantity of soap, some yellow, some mottled, and some white; he lodged in Short-street, Cumberland-street; we took him to the office, and he confessed he had taken it.
What did you say to him first?
I did not say any thing; there is no particular mark upon the soap.
Three men were taken up at this time for soap-stealing?
Yes.
And the other two were both acquitted?
I had rather not go into that.
I apprehended the prisoner; I found this soap at this lodging; he told us himself where he lived; he said he had taken the carraway seeds for his children.
