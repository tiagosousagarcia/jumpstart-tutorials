I live in South-street, Manchester-square , I keep a chandler's shop ; I lost my money in the till, mentioned in the indictment, on the 9th of last month; at half past eight in the morning, the prisoner came in and took it; I saw him go out, nobody was in the shop; I called out stop thief! immediately, and he was stopped; I saw him set down the till at a distance from the door, that was on my calling out; he was brought back by a life-guardsman.
I apprehended the prisoner; there was a cry of stop thief!
I was not nigh the house.
