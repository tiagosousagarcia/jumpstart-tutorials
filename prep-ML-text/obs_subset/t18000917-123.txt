I keep a shoe shop upon Tower-hill : On the 8th of this month, about half past seven in the evening, I saw the prisoner knock my sister down, and go out of the shop with the shoes, but I did not see his face; he was secured in a few minutes after; I dare say, within three minutes.
I am sister to the last witness: I went into the shop to snuff the candles, and, in leaning over the counter, I saw the prisoner lying along, inside the counter; I gave him the meeting at the end of the counter, to stop him, and he laid hold of me, and dragged me till he got me outside the door, and then he knocked me down, and ran away; I called stop thief, and he was stopped by George Gray .
I saw the prisoner knock down Mrs. Adderley, and I followed him; I saw him drop the shoes, and I laid hold of him directly; I never lost sight of him.
I know nothing of it.
