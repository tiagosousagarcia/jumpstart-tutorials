It was on the 5th of July, at half after five in the morning I saw the prisoner, I asked her who she wanted, she made me no answer, and went away; I was so frightened I could not follow her.
I know nothing only that Mr. Young went after the prisoner.
I heard a great noise over my head, I went up stairs, and called out who is there, the prisoner said, it is I; I went down stairs and met the prisoner, and she went to the necessary and wanted to throw the gown down the necessary, but I prevented her.
