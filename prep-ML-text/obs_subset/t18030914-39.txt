- I live at No. 1, Flower-de-luce court, Spital-square : On Wednesday, the 20th of July, about one o'clock, I went to the privy, and laid my watch upon the ledge of a window, and went in doors again to dinner; I soon after missed it; I went to the privy, and it was gone; a woman in the yard said she had seen the prisoner go to the privy immediately after me, and came back directly; I then went up to his room, he lodged in the same house; he was not at home; I went back, and found him; I told him he was the man I wanted; he asked what I wanted with him; I said, did not you find something in the privy this afternoon, and he said, no, what should he find; I told him my watch; he said he had not seen it, and did not know any thing at all about it; I said, if you have, I will make you any satisfaction, if you will return it, or tell me where it is; he said he knew nothing of it, or he should he very happy to restore it to me, or any body else who might have left it; an officer then came in, and he still persisted he knew nothing of it; the officer then searched him, and found in his pocket two new handkerchiefs, and a pair of shoes; a little while after, he found in his coat some cherries, and a duplicate of the watch amongst them; it was pledged in Tooley-street; I saw it on the Friday following at the Office.
I am an officer belonging to Worship-street: On the 20th of July, I was sent for; I went to the prosecutor's house, I searched the prisoner, and found a duplicate of a watch upon him; the pawnbroker attended at the Office with the watch; the prisoner denied any knowledge of the watch till I found the duplicate, and then he said he had found it in the privy.
I am a pawnbroker in Tooley-street: I took in this watch from the prisoner on the 20th of July. (Produces it.)(The watch was identified by the prosecutor.)
I found this watch; I had a wife, and a child sucking at her breast, in great distress, and almost famishing for want, and I pledged it.
