I suspected the prisoner and watched her. On the morning of the 20th of October, there was a quart pot on the one pair of stairs. I saw the prisoner come up and take the pot and put it under her apron and go out with it; I sent a boy after her and she was brought back to Mrs. Moyse's house.
I was in the prosecutrix's house when she was brought back; I saw her take the pot from under her petticoats and put it under the bench where she sat.
She confessed taking the pot, but said it was the first thing of the kind she ever did.
I can say nothing in my defence; I leave it to the mercy of the court.
