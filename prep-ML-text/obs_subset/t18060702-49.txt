I live at the corner of Burlington street, Swallow street; on Monday the 12th of May, about ten o'clock in the morning, from information I found the woman in custody, and some of the pots were found upon her.
I am pot boy to Mr. Emans; on the 12th of May, about ten o'clock in the morning, as I had a strap of pots, I saw the prisoner standing at No. 3, New Burlington street, I went home and took the pots off from the strap, I went out again to get in more on the left hand side of the way, I went down the area of No. 14, to get my pots, I heard a noise with the pots, I ran up immediately, and found the woman was gone off with three quart pots under her clothes, I then hallooed to her twice, and the second time I hallooed to her she dropped the pots from under her clothes and ran away, I followed her to Berwick street, I and another person brought her back; I am sure she is the same woman.
What became of the pots.
(prosecutor) I picked them up.
