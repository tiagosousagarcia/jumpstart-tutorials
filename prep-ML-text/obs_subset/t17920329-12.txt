I am a widow; I lost a pair of boots last Wednesday was a fortnight; I had them to clean from a gentleman in Russel-court; I do not know who took them; the prisoner was standing just by Catherine-court, where I sit; I never found them; I believe it was about four, I cannot rightly say; he staid there while I cleaned the pair of boots, and while I cleaned a pair of shoes and buckles; he asked me what it was; I said, a penny; I hung up the boots; I began to clean the buckles, and the boots were gone; the prisoner ran up Bridges-street; a gentleman pursued him, and caught him.
About three, on the 13th instant, I was going through Vinegar-yard; there was a call of stop thief! the prisoner also called stop thief! I saw a little parcel drop, which could not be the boots; it was picked up by a person whom I supposed to be a Jew; I stopped the prisoner; I found nothing upon him.
Do you know the nature of an oath?
Yes.
What is it?
It is taking the book in my hand, and kissing it.
Well, and then, after you have taken the book, and kissed it, if you do not speak the truth, what is the consequence?
I shall go to hell, Sir.
I saw the prisoner and another man together, and I saw the prisoner take the boots and give them to the other man, and the other man ran away, and the prisoner ran up Vinegar-yard, and there were some people standing, and he said, clear the road! clear the road! I am sure the prisoner is the man.
I apprehended the prisoner; I found nothing on him.
I never touched the boots; I am a gardener; the boy said then he did not know who took them; the constable knows that.
Court to Cook. Did you hear the boy say so, or the woman?
No, I did not.
I never thieved a shilling in my life, nor had a pennyworth laid to my charge before.
