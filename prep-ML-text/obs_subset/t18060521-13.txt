I am assistant to William Tray , Sun-street , a linen draper . On the 12th of May, between the hours of five and six in the evening, the prisoner at the bar came with Mary Joyce into our shop, I shewed her some cottons, she objected to them, being too light, and on turning round to reach some more, and turning back again, I missed one of the pieces, which I had previously shewn her; I shewed her more pieces, she objected to their being too light; my master was down at tea, when he came up I told him I had missed a piece of cotton; I searched her, I found in her apron the seven yards of printed cotton which I had missed; the prisoner said it was the first time she had committed any offence, and she hoped I would forgive her; when I turned round and missed it there was no person in the shop. Mary Joyce , who recommended her to me, was gone out of the shop.
I am a shoe binder, I live at No. 16, Peter-street, Bishopsgate-street, Without. On the 12th of May the prisoner came to me and asked me if I would go with her and buy a gown, and to pay so much a week, I told her I bought things of Mr. Tray, I took her to his shop, and after the gentleman had taken down two pieces of cotton I saw my young master coming, I followed my master, he went to my room, and I went after him, I forgot to go back to the person I had left in the shop: I had been home ten minutes or a quarter of an hour before I found that she had taken this bit of cotton.
(to Phillips) You had not agreed to let her have a gown to pay so much a week.
I had not.
I produce the piece of cotton; on searching the prisoner this pocket was found underneath her apron. (The property identified by Phillips.)
