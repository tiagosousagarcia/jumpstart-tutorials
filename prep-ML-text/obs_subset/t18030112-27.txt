- I am a tailor , No. 13, Drury-lane: On last Saturday week I was moving from the Windsor Castle, in Holborn , to Drury-lane; in putting up my furniture, I missed three bed-curtains; the prisoner lodged at the Windsor Castle, while I was there; I suspected him; I found there was a person taken up for a fraud, and on Sunday I went to Tothill-fields, and saw the prisoner; I asked him what he had done with my curtains.
Was that the first thing you said to him?
Yes, and he said they were pledged to Brewer street; I went there on Monday, and found my curtains.
- I am servant to Mr. Turner, pawnbroker, in Brewer-street, (produces two curtains) I took in one of them myself from the prisoner, and I was present when the other was taken in from the prisoner; one was on the 9th of December, and the other on the 11th. - (The curtains were identified by the prosecutor.)
I am a constable; I searched the prisoner, and found a great number of duplicates; two of them of curtains. - (Produces them.)
These are my duplicates.
I leave it to the mercy of the Jury.
