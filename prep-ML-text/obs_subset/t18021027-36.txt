I am a widow, and live at No. 8, Clarence-place, Hackney-road ; I let out part of my house in lodgings: On the 16th of September I let a one pair of stairs room to the prisoner, furnished, at 5s. per week it was to be paid weekly; I asked him his employment; he told me he belonged to a boat that attended the revenue officers down the river, and brought them back again; but I had very soon reason to suppose it was false; he was mostly at home, and therefore I conceived he could not follow any lawful employment; he was very idle, and run in debt in the neighbourhood; about eight or ten days after he had taken the lodgings, there was a quarrel between him and his wife, and I thought I heard blows; I desired him to get another apartment, I did not like such people in my house; he told me he would; about eleven o'clock the same night, he brought me down a week's rent, and begged that I wuold not take any more notice of what had happened; in the course of the week I spoke to the young woman he called his wife; I told her I thuoght him a suspicious chracter; on the 6th of October he came down in the morning, and asked me to lend him a basket to pack up some things; I knew they had nothing of their own, and I was suspicious they would take my things; I went out under pretence of going to borrow a basket, and fetched Mr. Mason, an officer; he staid in my apartment, and I went up stairs and desired him to let me examine my property; he refused to let me examine the bed; he seemed very much agitated, and said, Fanny, go and tell my brother to bring me money immediately; she went out, but never returned again; he wished very much to get out of the house; he wanted to go down and take in some milk, but I told him I would take it in; I at last examined the bed, and missed the articles mentioned in the indictment; I had lett them all with my lodgings; Mr. Mason asked him where they were; he replied, in pawn, and gave him the duplicates out of his pocket; he then took him in custody; he said, at Worship-street, that he had pawned them, but knew not the consequence.
I am servant to Mr. Neville, a pawnbroker, in Old-street-road, (produces the property) ; they were pawned at different times by the prisoner, in the name of Thomas Rhodes .
I intended to redeem them.
