I am a breeches-maker , in the Strand, the prisoner was in my employ; In consequence of information, I went to the house where the prisoner lodged, where I found some duplicates which led to the property in the indictment; he had worked for me about three months.
I am a pawnbroker, in Short's-gardens, (produces two pair of breeches;) I took them in of a woman, who said her name was Robins; I never saw the prisoner, till I saw him at Bow-street; I saw his wife there, and knew her to be the same woman that had pledged these articles.
I saw the prisoner sign this, it was quite voluntary, (it is read;) the prisoner, Samuel Robins , says, he purchased the two pair of breeches now produced, for one pound, three shillings, and sixpence, of a man who looked like a gentleman's servant, but he cannot tell who the man is, or what is his name, and that he sent Lucy Robins, his wife, to pawn them.
I made these leather-breeches, they were brought to me to make by the prisoner, he told me they were for a customer, (produces eighteen pair of gloves, unsewed;) the prisoner employed me to get these gloves made; Mr. Lingham has had them in his possession.
The leather breeches are called in the indictment, doe slops, that is the name they are known by in the trade; I know these to be mine, we stamped every skin we had with a stamp I have in my hand; the gloves are stamped in the same way; I know the nankeens by the particular way in which we have them made; we have an exclusive right of making them so by patent.
Have you never sold any leather?
No.
I have lived with Mrs. Robins since her husband has been in trouble; I was there drinking tea with Mrs. Robins, the week before Easter, when a man came in and asked Mr. Robins if he would buy some leather, he looked at it, and Mr. Robins said it was damaged leather, that is all I know about it.
