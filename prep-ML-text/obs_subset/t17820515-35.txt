I went out; when I came home again, upon going up stairs, I found my room door, which I had left locked, shut, but not locked, and saw the prisoner and a black man in my bed-chamber. I screamed out twice, upon which they both ran away; the prisoner was stopped, and brought back again in about two or three minutes; I am sure he is one of the men that was in my room. There was a picklock-key found upon the prisoner. I found some things packed up, ready to carry away.
I went to see a master I served my time with, in Moor-lane; I then went about some business of my master's. I went up an entry to make water; while I was stooping, my shoe having slipped down at heel, they laid hold of me. I do not know any thing of that gentlewoman's place. I never was up in it.
