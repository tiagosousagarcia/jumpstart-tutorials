I am a turner in Bond-street ; a piece of painted floor-cloth was at my door for sale; I went out, and came home again before twelve o'clock; then the cloth was gone; I heard no more of it for a fortnight or three weeks; then there was an advertisement from the public office in Litchfield-street, that the things were found in the custody of the prisoner; I went to the office and saw the cloth, and knew it to be mine.
I am a pawnbroker in Aldersgate-street; on the sixth of February this piece of cloth was brought to my house, and pawned for half a guinea.
I am a painter; I painted a piece of cloth like that which was sold to the prosecutor; but I am not positive to the cloth.
I found in the prisoner's room a duplicate of this piece of cloth, pawned in the name of the prisoner.
