I am a single woman; I live in Church-lane, St. Giles' s: On the 1st of this month, I stopped the prisoner going out of my house; she called to be let out; she lodged in the house; I had a suspicion of her; I searched her, and found a sheet under her petticoats; she had on a man's coat; I have had it ever since; I missed it off the bed; (produces it;) I know it to be mine; at the time the lodging was let to her for the night, she had a man with her.
And she was to pay you for the use of the room, including the bed and the sheet?
No; she slept in the two pair of stairs, and she took this sheet from the one pair of stairs; I am very certain this is the same sheet; I have two more like it; I took it from under her petticoat, and I left a person to stand by her while I went for a constable, and when I came back the sheet was behind the door.
I lodge in this house: I saw Mrs. Reynolds take the sheet from her, on Wednesday morning, the 1st of January; it was concealed round her body, under her clothes; my landlady went for the constable; I missed a sheet off the one pair of stairs bed; the prisoner slept in the two pair, and so did I, upon the same floor; as soon as ever the prisoner went down stairs, I followed her.
I know nothing about it; I pulled all my things off, and she could find nothing; she said she had lost a great many things, and she would make me pay for all; and then she went into the one pair of stairs room, where two women were in bed, and she brought the sheet out from behind the door.
