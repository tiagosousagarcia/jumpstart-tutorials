I am house-keeper at the Treasury, Whitehall : On the 23d of November last, I had a quantity of coals belonging to his Majesty; I have known the prisoner a great many years, and never had cause to suspect him; he was employed to carry coals from the cellar to the different apartments; he had no order to send out coals for me; he has been continued as lamplighter up to this day.
I am an officer: On the 23d of November, about half past six o'clock in the morning, I met John Jones with a bag; I asked him what he had there, he was confused; I took him to the watch-house, and examined the bag, and found coals; I then apprehended the prisoner, and told him I had taken Jones, who said he had the coals of him; he said he had given him a few coals, as the man had a large family, and was very sorry for it.
In November, the officer met me with a sack of coals, which were given me by Mr. Fulmer at the Treasury.
You asked him to let you have a few coals, and he gave you a few out of compassion?
Yes.
He had no advantage by them - you did not pay him any thing?
No.
