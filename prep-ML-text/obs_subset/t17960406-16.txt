On Sunday night last, about eleven o'clock, I was going up Holborn, the prisoner at the bar took me by the arm, nearly opposite Ely Place; she asked me to give her some money; I told her I had no coppers; I was going to leave her; she gave me a sudden pull by the arm, and put her hand round me; I got myself disengaged from her, rather suspecting that she might have picked my pocket; I put my hand in my pocket, and discovered that my money was gone; I had not three minutes before put my hand in my pocket; I had three guineas and two half-guineas; I immediately turned back, and took her by the right hand; I asked her where she lived; she said, in Covent-garden; I told her it was too far, but I would take her to a nearer house; I led her to the end of Fetter-lane; she turned up Fetter-lane, and seemed to wish to get herself disengaged from me, by pulling off her pattens, and various manoeuvres; I called the watchman, and delivered her to him; she was there searched; three guineas and an half-guinea were found in her pocket, with a sixpence, and some halfpence; on bringing her to the watch-house, the watchman said, he heard something fall; we searched, but could not find any thing.
I wish him to be asked for the money that he gave me, and then took away from me again.
Had you any toying with her, or any communication with her)?
I had not.
He was in liquor, and he gave me the money out of his waistcoat pocket, and said he would sleep all night with me.
Is that so?
It is not, my Lord.
Nor you had no improper communication with her?
No.
Were you quite sober?
Perfectly so.
