Do you know the prisoner at the bar?
She was a lodger of mine, I live at No. 5, Strutton-ground ; she has lived with me ever since Christmas till the 14th of February, in a ready-furnished room, at three shillings and sixpence a week.
Was any furniture of the room missing?
Yes; all the articles mentioned in the indictment; I take in washing from one family, the table-cloth belonged to Mr. Joel Barlow , and the napkins, they were delivered to me to wash, with other things; I missed them at different times, I have only found some of them again.
I live at Mr. Burrows's, a pawnbroker: I produce a petticoat, two napkins, and two handkerchiefs; the petticoat and napkins were pledged for half-a-crown, and the handkerchiefs for one shilling and three-pence; I believe it to be by the prisoner, I cannot swear to her person.
I am an officer belonging to Queen-square: In consequence of information I went to the lodgings of the prisoner, at Mrs. Simmons's, No. 5, Strutton-ground; the prisoner gave me this duplicate, and told me it was all she had; on searching farther I found another duplicate, in a little jar upon the mantle-piece; they are the duplicates belonging to the property now produced.
You told me that that table-cloth you never had in your custody from the family; and that you could take your oath of it?
It is false.
She told me that she never had the table-cloth to wash, nor in her custody; and the shift she had given in a mistake to a person, and she had put another in its place; I never was guilty of such a thing in my life; I never touched a thing she had, a wicked wretch.
