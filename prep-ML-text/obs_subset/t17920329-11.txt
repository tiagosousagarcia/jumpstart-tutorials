The prisoner gave me a jostle, and took my pocket-book out of my fob, about ten paces from the end of Bread-street , on Friday, the 16th of March, about a quarter before one at noon; I passed him; then he passed me; I discovered it in the moment, both felt and saw him; after pursuing him a few paces, I was rudely knocked down;\\ not\\ withstanding which, I kept sight of the object, and he was taken; he was not searched; I apprehended he handed the book to some other person.
Knowlys, Prisoner's Counsel. Nobody was with this young lad at all?
I saw him and another man walking.
The prisoner came into our warehouse about one, on the day Mr. Long mentions; I asked him his pleasure; he said, Mr. Tomkyns; Mr. Long came in, with his face all over blood; he said he was recommended to Mr. Tomkyns, but did not know by whom, nor for what.
I leave it to my counsel.
