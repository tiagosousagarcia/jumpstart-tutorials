I am a tin-plate worker , I live at No. 29, Norton Falgate ; I had two tin baths at the door on the 9th of February; I had taken in one, and a customer came into the shop and prevented me from taking in the other; about a quarter after ten in the evening I asked the people that were passing and repassing, if they had seen any one with a tin bath; they told me they had seen a man go down Norton Falgate with a bath; I immediately ran down and caught it upon him; it is my own making, I can swear to it.
I am an Officer: the property and the man were brought to me at the watch-house; I took charge of the prisoner.
I would ask you whether I was in my senses at the time I did that?
He appeared to be very much intoxicated.
I am a porter at Leadenhall a I hope Mr. Baker will tell the gentlemen in Court there was a gentleman came forward at the watch-house to speak for me.
There was a gentleman in the neighbourhood said he had carried loads for him, and he always found him an honest man.
