I am a broker : I lost a table last Thursday; I missed it between four and five; I pursued the prisoner, and found the table on his shoulder; I have the table here (produced) ; it is my table; he put it down, and run away; I never lost sight of him after.
Do you know what will become of you, if you tell a lie?
I shall go into brimstone and fire.
I saw that man walking before Mr. Merryman's door, and I told Mr. Merryman's daughter that he had taken a table away.
I am a constable: I saw the prosecutor lay hold of the prisoner's collar, and I took him into custody.
I was coming along, and there was a mob; I asked what was the matter, and they took me; I am as innocent as the child unborn.
