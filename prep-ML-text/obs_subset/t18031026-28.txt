On the 21st of September I was mending a black cotton gown, at the White-horse in Rupert-street , kept by Mr. Tibby, I am his servant ; I left it upon the back of a chair; my mistress called me away to take the child; the prisoner was sitting with her back against the chair where my gown hung, that was between nine and ten o'clock; when I came back, the gown was gone; there was another woman with her.
I am a constable; I searched the prisoner's lodgings, I think, on the 22d of September, in consequence of information that I received; I went up stairs, and found this gown in an unlocked cupboard, about two yards from the prisoner's room, there was nothing else in the cupboard; there was another lodger in the back room.
How long was it between the time of her sitting against the chair and your charging the constable with her?
Not a quarter of an hour.
This cupboard is never made use of by any body in the house; I know nothing at all of the gown.
