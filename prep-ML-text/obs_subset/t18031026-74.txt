You are a salesman in Smithfield , and live in Bedfordshire?
Yes: On Thursday, the 6th of this month, I received fourteen lambs from Lord Offory's bailiff, at Wooburn, and eight sheep from Mr. Cumberland; I delivered them to John Burbridge, my servant, to bring them to town; the lambs were marked with ruddle marks round the neck and head, a stroke on the off shoulder, and a pitch brand on the near side; the eight sheep were marked with a ruddle down the head and neck, and a dot on the off hip; I was at Smithfield on the Sunday night, but did not see them till Monday morning at seven o'clock; I was informed that two lambs and a sheep were lost; I saw them afterwards at Mr. Probert's, a butcher, in Great Bath-street; I am sure they are the same.
On Saturday, the 8th of October, I brought fourteen lambs of Lord Offory's, and eight sheep of Mr. Cumberland's, to Holloway, they were all right at five o'clock on Sunday evening; they were kept secure within the railing till I delivered them to William Grant to take to Smithfield, they could not get out themselves; I delivered them to him about eight o'clock, I have seen them since, and am sure they are the same.
I am drover to Mr. Stopp: I received the sheep and lambs from the last witness; I took them to Smithfield, and when I put them in the pens I found two lambs and a sheep missing; I saw them again on the Monday following, and am sure they are the same.
There was no circumstance to induce you to suppose they were stolen from you?
No, it was an uncommonly dark night.
I am a watchman at the end of Mutton-hill: On the 9th of October, about twenty minutes before eleven o'clock, I was standing at my box leaning over; I saw three sheep coming up the hill, towards Clerkenwell-green, from Hatton-garden; the prisoner at the bar was following them, with a pipe in his hand, or in his mouth, I do not know which; the sheep made a stop in the road when they got to the top of the hill; the prisoner came up, and seemed rather confused which way he should turn them, as I thought; I went out of my box, and the sheep turned about to the right; I said to the prisoner, holloa, my friend, what are you going to do with these sheep; he said, they belonged to a man in Liquorpond-street; I asked him who the man was, but he did not tell me his name; I told him I thought they belonged to some drover in Smithfield; he said, no, they did not; I told him I thought he had not come honestly by them; he said, he knew the man very well, he was a drover in Liquorpond-street; I told him I did not think any drover lived there; he said he had them in Liquorpond-street once, and he wished to get them there again; then he went on till he came to Castle-street, which is the next turning on the right hand, it leads up to Saffron-hill, and goes to Hatton-garden again; he was going to turn the corner, when I caught hold of him by the collar, and told him I should take him into custody till I was perfectly satisfied, and I should take care of the sheep; I got assistance, and took the sheep to Mr. Probert's, a butcher, in Great Bath-street; I saw the sheep again on the Monday, when Mr. Stopp owned them; I never saw the prisoner before; he was not sober; but seemed to know what he was doing.
You are a watchman?
Yes.
You are acquainted with a great number of drovers about Smithfield?
I do not know any of them.
You know of the remuneration given to persons for the detection of sheep-stealers?
No.
What do you expect if this man should be convicted?
I don't know what to expect.
Upon your oath, do you not expect fifty pounds, and do you not wish for it?
I do not wish for any thing.
What situation of life are you in?
I am a watchman.
Fifty pounds is no object to you?
Yes, fifty pence is an object, but not in a clandestine way; if the man is convicted by the real truth, I wish to have it; the prisoner said, he had been led into this, and he would be d-d if he would do a good-natured action any more; then he offered me five shillings if I would give up the charge.
Did he not tell you where he lived?
Yes.
Upon the oath you have taken, have you never said to any body that you believed in your conscience the prisoner was an innocent man?
I did say something to Dean that I thought there were more concerned as well as this man.
Did you or not say to Dean, or any body else, that you believed the prisoner at the bar was an innocent man?
Yes, I did say I believed the man was led into it.
My question is, did you or not say you believed he was innocent?
I have told you as near as I can recollect what I did say.
Had you seen any other person with him?
At the time I saw him upon the hill there were two or three men following him up the hill, but I did not see them interfere with the sheep, or driving them.
I am a watchman; I received the prisoner from the last witness, and conveyed him to the watch-house; he said, he had brought the sheep from a drove in Liquorpond-street; he said, a drover asked him to stop them while he drank his pot of beer; that they ran away, and he ran after them to bring them back; he did not tell me his name, but said it was an acquaintance of his.
I am a Police officer belonging to Hatton-garden; I received information that there had been three sheep ranning about for a considerable time in Hatton-wall and Vine-street, and that the parties driving them were not drovers; I found by the watchman that they were gone up Mutton-hill; I followed them; I heard a noise, and thought it was down the courts there, and in Turnmill-street I met a man with the prisoner in custody; I took him to St. James's watch-house; I asked him who the other two were that were with him; I was informed there were two others; the prisoner told me it was Turner and Will the Sailor, who lodged at the Royal Oak; he informed me there was a flock of sheep coming down Back-hill, and he stood making water against the wall; that these three sheep turned round Christopher-street, and that the drover halloaed out, Turner, stop them; I asked him if he knew the drover; he said, he believed his name was Mills, or Giles, or Miles; I told him I knew the name of Miles, but did not know the other names; I asked him how he came to know the drover, and he said the way he came to know the drover was, that they drank a pot of beer together at the Royal Oak the Friday evening before, and he ran after the sheep. On the Monday morning I apprehended Will the Sailor and Turner; they were discharged before the Magistrate, as not knowing any thing of it.
I went out of the house to make water at the corner of Liquorpond-street and Christopher-street, and as I was standing at the corner of the place, very much in liquor, somebody sung out, stop them, and I ran after them, and I did not cease running till I was stopped myself.
Do you recollect on the 9th of October being in company with the prisoner at the bar?
Yes, at the house of Turner, about eight o'clock in the morning, and was in company with him backwards and forwards till twenty minutes past ten o'clock at night; I lodge at the Royal Oak; he was drunk when I left him.
He was not absent from you ten minutes the whole day?
He might be absent about an hour at twelve or one o'clock; he dined with me about half past one, and we were together till five o'clock.
Do you remember what you had for breakfast?
Yes,\\ to\\ ast and coffee.
If any body has said you had crumpets, that is not true.?
It is not.
What had you for dinner?
Roast mutton and potatoes; I believe it was a bit of the back of the neck.
What had you for supper?
Bread and cheese.
If any body has said you had cold mutton, that is not true?
It is not.
What had you to drink?
Porter.
If any body has said you had spirits and water, that is not true?
I had not; perhaps the women might have a little; I did not see any.
Who was present at supper?
Myself, Mr. Turner, and his wife that is now, Mr. Cropley's daughter, her mother, and Mr. Denman.
Did any body else come in?
Mr. Death.
Have you ever known an honester man than the prisoner?
He has been a very honest man for any thing I know, as long as I have known him, which is about three weeks or a month.
You are the wife of Samuel Cropley ?
Yes; I know the prisoner: On the 9th of October he came home with me about twenty minutes after ten o'clock at night; I went to Mrs. Turner's a little before nine; I met with the prisoner there; he stopped at my house till a quarter before eleven.
You went there a quarter before nine?
I cannot say particularly as to the time; I thought it was time for the girls to come home, and I went to fetch them.
You said, when you were examined before, that you went a quarter before ten?
I cannot tell rightly.
Have you had any reason to alter your opinion since?
No.
Your youngest daughter had been there all day?
Yes.
She came home with you that night?
I cannot say whether she did or not.
Did you not swear two hours ago that your youngest daughter came home with you?
My youngest daughter lit me down stairs.
Did you not swear you brought them both home with you?
No; I said my daughter came down stairs with me; but whether they both went home with me, I cannot tell.
She said before, her youngest daughter did not come home all that day.
After you had given your evidence, you heard your daughter give her's?
Yes.
And you heard her say she slept there?
Yes.
Your youngest daughter never was out at service?
No.
Therefore, if any body has said they became acquainted with your daughter six months ago at service, that is not true?
No.
And if any body describes her as a servant out of place, that is not true?
No.
Did Turner never become acquainted with her in place?
No.
Your mother keeps the Royal Oak?
Yes; on the 9th of October the prisoner came in about half past ten, or a quarter before eleven o'clock.
Do you recollect after that his going out for any purpose?
No.
Do you remember his taking a pipe to smoke?
No; he came into our house about half past ten, or a quarter before eleven o'clock, very much in liquor, with a pipe in his mouth; my mother said, Mr. Denman, go to-bed, for all the other lodgers are gone; he went from the bar, and I thought he was gone to-bed.
Do you know whether he went for any purpose into the street?
No, I thought he was gone to-bed.
You are a coach-master?
Yes: On the 9th of October I saw the prisoner at the Royal Oak, about a quarter before eleven o'clock at night; he had a pipe in his mouth; I was paying my reckoning; Mrs. Goddard desired him to go to-bed; she said, the rest were gone to-bed, and there was a candle waiting for him; he appeared to me to be rather drunk; he then turned as though he was going to-bed; I went out of the house; I had occasion to stop, and heard something gently padding up Back-hill; I turned about to go home, and saw the prisoner in the middle of the street; I then saw three sheep; I heard somebody cry out, turn them; the voice came from the end of Hattongarden.
Was there nobody with the sheep?
Nobody at all.
Then who called out, turn them?
I cannot say.
The voice you heard say, turn them, was in Hatton-garden?
Yes.
That is the opposite way from Liquorpond-street?
Yes.
You are a watchman?
Yes: On the 9th of October I saw three sheep astray, one large one and two small ones, under St. John's-gate; I saw them come out of the square just before I went half past ten; they went up Berkeley-street towards Red-Lion-street.
That is the contrary way from Backhill?
Yes.
Where do you live?
I am a boot and shoe maker, No. 1, Passing-alley, Clerkenwell; I have lodged there going on thirteen years: On the 9th of October, as I was coming home, about half past ten o'clock at night, I met three sheep, a large horned one and two small ones; they turned up Red-Lion-street towards Clerkenwell-green; I met them the corner of Berkeley-street; I did not see any body with them.
I am a watchman: I received information that there were some sheep astray upon Clerkenwell-green; I went to look for them, but could not find them.
Had you any conversation with Martin?
Yes; I will not be sure whether it was on the Tuesday or Wednesday after the first examination at Hatton-garden; after coming from duty, at six o'clock in the morning, the superintendant of the night, and me, and Martin, were going down Benjamin-street, Martin said to us, will you go and have any gin? I rather equivocated, and said, I did not wish to have any gin; he then said to me, I am a d-d fool; I said, for why; says he, when the man asked me to go along with him to help turn the sheep, I might have napped the other two.
What is the construction of the word napping?
Taking them.
That is, he might as well have had a reward of one hundred and fifty pounds as fifty?
Yes.
How came the prisoner to find out that you had had this conversation?
Because I communicated it to his sister, Mrs. Browning.
Where does she live?
Somewhere in Bell-yard, by Temple-bar.
