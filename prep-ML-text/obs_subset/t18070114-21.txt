You are a brush maker living in Old Bethlem .
I am; the prisoner was my servant .
On the 29th of December, in consequence of any suspicion that you had, did you send for an officer.
I did. When the officer came he searched her; I observed she moved from one part of the room to the other, and threw down part of a brush, and let a purse fall. Her box was searched in her presence, and a pair of stockings was found, and a shaving case.
You are the constable that was sent for to search her.
Yes.
The brush was for the kitchen, and the shaving case I had to put my cap on in general. I believe the children took it up and put it in my unlocked box; the stockings were taken in a mistake, they were old, and very bad ones.
