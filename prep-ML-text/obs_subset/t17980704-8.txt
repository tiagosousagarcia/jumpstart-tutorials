I am the wife of Daniel Pippin : I lost the things mentioned in the indictment, (repeating them) the prisoner slept in the house two or three nights before, as a lodger; this bonnet is mine, it was taken off her head, and this cotton handkerchief I took off her neck, that is all I have found; I found them the third night afterwards. She owned before his Majesty that she had taken them.
She keeps a bawdy-house on Saltpetre-bank; a young man came in and asked me to get something to drink, and I put the bonnet on; the handkerchief was my own, I had left it with her for sixpence.
