I am a press maker . I lost a wooden rule and plane, from my shop; I did not see the prisoner take it; I saw it the day the prisoner came to dispose of an axe, to sell; I knew him before, by doing work for me, as a smith ; this was on Friday, the 4th or 5th of last month: I had no money for this axe; I went out to borrow the money, and left him in the shop, and came back and paid him for the axe; I missed them presently after; having suspicion of the prisoner, I found my rule.
On the 15th of February, on a Friday, I saw the rule on the prisoner; I knew it was my master's, by it's being burned with using it, and another mark: I am his servant: about a fortnight after I saw the prisoner with the rule, and informed my master, that I believed the man he bought the axe of, had got his rule; he told me to go and tell him he had got a job to do; so he came and threw it down on my master's work bench, himself; and before this he had said he had none, he had left it at home.
Are you sure it is your master's rule?
Yes, I am sure so: my master had him taken: my master has had the care of it ever since.
I bought the rule for sixpence; it was not burned; one of my little girls put it into the fire; and on that day he bought the axe we went out to drink a pot of beer together.
