I am servant to Mr. Davis, of Bishopsgate-street . On the 29th of June, I was sitting in the parlour at dinner, I heard the footstep of a person in the shop; I turned round, and saw the prisoner go out of the shop; I pursued him, and never lost sight of him. I went up to him, and lifted up his coat, and took this petticoat from under his coat: I can swear to the petticoat being the property of my master, Mr. Thomas Davis ; it is marked 8 s. in my hand-writing; it was hanging up in the shop when I went to dinner.
I was stupefied with liquor, and did not know what I was doing: I throw myself on the mercy of the Court; I am lately come from Bristol, and I have not a friend in the world.
