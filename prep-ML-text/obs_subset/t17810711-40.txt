I keep a cheesemonger's shop , in Fleet-market . I was informed a person had stole a piece of bacon. I went after her. I went past the prisoner, and stopped another poor woman. My wife then pointed to the prisoner, who had stopped to cheapen a joint of meat. I went up to her, turned aside her cloak, and she had two pieces; they weighed 3 lb. and upwards. I had just cut them up, and laid them there. I know the bacon I found on her was mine.
