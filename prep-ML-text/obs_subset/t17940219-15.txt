I am a constable. On the 11th of February I was sent for by Mr. Cully, to go and take the prisoner, I understood that he was at No. 3, laze-buildings, I went to No. 3, there, he was locked up, I desired him to open the door, and he opened the door, and there I found the hat in a closet.
I went with a friend to a public house in Charing-Cross, and was very much in liquor, and I went to sleep, and when it was time to go home he awaked me, and put this hat on my head, and bid me come along, and I went with him, not knowing but it was my own hat. I should have employed counsel if I had had more time, and I should have had witnesses here in the evening.
