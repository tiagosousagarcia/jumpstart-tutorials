I lodge in Well-street , I go out a chairing; I was out a washing next door when some person took away, from my lodging, a mahogany round table, and a tea-kettle, between seven and eight in the evening, I heard the alarm, and went out; about an hour after, I found them in a house in Malaga-court, Nightingale-lane, about a quarter of a mile from my lodging.
I am an officer: I went, with the last witness, to a house in Malaga-court, where I saw the table and kettle; I brought the woman in whose possession they were to the watch-house.
I apprehended the people of the house; I met the prisoner, and he said he found the things facing the Well-street Play-house; he said a man put them down, and stopped to make water, and then ran away, and he thought it was requisite they should be taken care of; and he said he was coming up to the watch-house, and he walked along with me.
I saw a man put the table down, and stop, pretending to make water, but I found he did not, and seeing me look at him, he took to his heels and run away; I took the table and carried it home, and hearing that it was stole, I was going to the watch house to tell them of it, when I met the watchman.
