I am a widow, I live in King's-street, Mile-end New-town , the prisoner came to lodge with me just after Bow-fair, in the last year, and left my lodgings about three months ago, she was gone a fortnight before I knew it; I had the door opened, and missed the articles mentioned in the indictment; I found these duplicates in the room, (producing them;) I did not find the prisoner till about a fortnight ago.
I am servant to Mr. Burton, a pawnbroker; the prisoner used frequently to come to our shop, (produces a sheet;) Mrs. Burton took this in, she is not here; I took in this bolster of the prisoner, (produces it;) I sent her three shillings upon it; I cannot swear it was the prisoner, it was pledged in the name of Mary Chalker .
