I am the wife of Charles Clements : the things mentioned in the indictment were in a drawer; I found some of the things dropped on the floor, and one on the bureau; I had seen them about an hour before; when I came home I found the prisoner in my room; and he said he wanted to have his shoes mended, and asked for Vernon.
I am constable: Mr. Clements called me to his house; I found the drawers open, and the things scattered upon the floor.
I cut my shoe in coming from Chelsea, and I ripped my shoe; I thought it a pity to lose my shoes for 5 d. or 6 d. and I inquired for a person to mend it, and they directed me to that house. I have the shoes on now.
There was nothing found upon the prisoner but a duplicate; no pick-lock keys, or any thing of the sort.
