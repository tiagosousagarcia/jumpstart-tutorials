I am steward to Mr. Mortimer; I know these sashes belong to one of his houses in Tottenham-court-road , No. 19, on the Terras; they were fixed on the staircase; I saw them on the 9th of June, between nine and ten.
On Saturday the 3d of June, I arose early, and coming out of my house which is opposite to this, I heard a noise, and presently after I saw the prisoner come out with the sashes, he lodged them at the back of the house; I got assistance, and he was secured; his left hand bled very much, one of the squares was cracked.
I stopped a minute where the sashes stood.
He owned before Sir Robert that he went in foolishly and meant to carry the sashes back again.
