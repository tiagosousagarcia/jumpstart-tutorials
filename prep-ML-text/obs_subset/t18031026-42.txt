- I live servant with Mr. Waring, No. 10, Caroline-street, Bedford-square ; the prisoner was a painter at work in the house: I lost a handkerchief and a pair of stockings out of a box in a back room that he was painting; they belonged to a Mr. Ferguson, who is gone to Scotland, and left them in my care; I missed them on the Sunday se'nnight after he left the house; I had him apprehended; the stockings were found upon him, and a duplicate of the handkerchief.
- I took the prisoner into custody on Saturday morning last; he was in bed; he put on these stockings, (producing them.) I asked him where he got them; he said, he bought them at Birmingham; I found in his pocket-book a duplicate of silk handkerchief.(Thomas Vincent, servant to Mr. Dobree, a pawnbroker, produced the handkerchief.)
