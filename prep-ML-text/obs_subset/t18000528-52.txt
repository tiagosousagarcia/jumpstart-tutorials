I am a private gentleman, I live ten miles from Exeter; I had my pocket picked coming out of the Foundling-chapel ; I buttoned my coat pocket when I came out of the chapel, and within a minute of that time, I discovered my pocket unbuttoned, and my pocket-book taken out; the instant that I put my hand towards my pocket, the prisoner, who was close by my side, hasted forward; I pursued him as fast as I could through the people; I never lost sight of him; I seized him, and accused him of having taken my pocket-book; he declared his innocence, and said he was a tradesman in such a street, such a number; he told me he had not my pocket-book, he was innocent; I told him. I would not let him go, and during the altercation, I saw him take my pocket-book out of his pocket, and throw if into the street, a little boy picked it up, and said, \"I have got your pocket-book, sir;\" I continued to hold him, and had him carried, I believe, into the vestry, where the governors were; my pocket-book contained five Bank-notes, two of five pounds, two of two pounds, and one of one pound, making together fifteen pounds.
Did you feel any thing at your pocket;
I thought I did, which caused me to put my hand down.
I take it for granted there were a great many people collected?
Yes.
Had you got compleatly clear from the crowd before you stopped him?
Yes.
It was dark, was it not?
It was light enough to discover that it was a red body.
Do you mean to say, that by no possible means you could be mistaken in his being that person who was next to you?
I think it impossible.
Which pocket was your pocket-book in?
My lest.
There was a very considerable press upon you?
Yes.
I picked up the pocket-book and gave it to Mr. Bellew, the prisoner is the man that threw it away.
How old are you?
Thirteen.
Had you been to the chapel?
Yes.
There was too great a crowd for you to see who did this?
No, they made room when the prisoner was running. GUILTY
