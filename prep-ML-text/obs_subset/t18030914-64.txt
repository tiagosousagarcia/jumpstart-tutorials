My husband keeps the Swan, at Hungerford-stairs ; the prisoner lodged with me; I missed a flat-iron, and sent to the prisoner to ask her if she had it; she said, no; I sent for a constable, and she delivered up the tickets to him.
I am a constable, and searched the prisoner, and found the tickets for the iron and cotton.
I pledged the things, not meaning to cheat, but to get them out again.
