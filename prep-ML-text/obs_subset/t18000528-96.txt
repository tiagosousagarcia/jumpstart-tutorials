I am the wife of Charles Stedman , No.9, Great Peter-street, Westminster ; I keep a chandiers's-shop and coal-shed : On Saturday night, the 5th of April, between eight and nine o'clock, three soldiers came into the shop; I asked them what they wanted, but before I got an answer, the tallest of the three reached over the counter to a cheshire cheese; he pulled it and I pulled it, but he got it from me; that was not the prisoner; the other two ran away, and I secured the prisoner; I have never seen the cheese since.
Did I not ask for two-penny worth of bread and cheese?
One of you did, but I cannot say which.
Did they all come in together?
They did.
I was in the back-room with Mrs. Stedman when three men came into the shop; Mrs. Stedman got up and left me in the back-room; all on a sudden she cried out for assistance, and stop thief; I went into the shop, and we secured the prisoner.
I am an officer; I took charge of the prisoner: He said he came to ask for two-pennyworth of bread and cheese, and these men came behind him and took the cheese away.
I went in to buy two-pennyworth of bread and cheese, and two men came in and knocked me down, and ran away with the cheese; I was going to assist the gentlewoman, when she sent for a constable and took me up.
