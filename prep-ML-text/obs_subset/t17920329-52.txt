My business lies so open to my servants that I cannot miss a small quantity of goods; I went up stairs with the prisoner, and he opened two boxes; there was a third, which he said belonged to another person; I sent for him, and when he came he said the box did not belong to him; I then told the prisoner I would not be trifled with, and I sent for a constable; then he pulled out the key; the box was opened, and I found the six bags; I gave charge of him; he begged for mercy; I desired the constable to search him; he found forty-seven guineas and a half on him.
I am a beadle and constable, Mr. Barber sent for me: I stopped in the shop till I was called for: I took the money from him, as Mr. Barber has described; I was taking him to the Compter, and he seemed to have a desire to get away. (Corroborates the remaining testimony of Mr. Barber.)
I was in the counting-house of Mr. Barber when he called in the prisoner and taxed him with robbing him, and desired to see the prisoner's boxes; he complied; and Mr. Barber desired me to accompany. (This witness the same as the last.)
The box was not mine; it was the prisoner's.
