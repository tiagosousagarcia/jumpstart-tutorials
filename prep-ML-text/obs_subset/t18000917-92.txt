I am a linen-draper , in Glazier's-alley, Wellclose-square : On the 22d of August, the prisoner came to my shop, and asked to look at some stockings, I shewed her several pair, but none would suit her; I thought I perceived her putting something in her apron; after I had shewed her a great many, she said, they were not for herself; she would go and fetch her brother; as she was going out, I followed her, and took the stockings out of her apron; I sent for a constable, and gave charges of her; she seems to be a very poor girl, I have no doubt but she has done it from poverty.(The constable produced the stockings, which were deposed to by the prosecutor.)
