I live with Mr. Gardiner. On the 28th of January, at a quarter past seven in the morning, I was minding my master's shop, in the door way; Daniel Lynch , the prisoner at the bar, took this cheese from two more; the window is in the market; I asked twice before he got it on his head, what he was going to do with the cheese; he made me no answer: he put it on his head, and ran away with it; I ran after him, and I saw a young man in the passage, and I called out stop him, and the prisoner threw the cheese down; I took up the cheese, and carried to the shop, and charged him with a constable: it was about twenty yards from the shop it was picked up.
I am sure this is my cheese, it has my mark on it.
I went after the prisoner, and saw him stopped, and saw him drop the cheese, the 28th, I pursued him and brought him back to the shop.
I am constable: I took the prisoner.
I was going to market with my mother, and I met two porters whom I knew, and they took me into a publick-house, and gave me some two-penny and gin to drink, which I was not used too, and did not know what I did.
