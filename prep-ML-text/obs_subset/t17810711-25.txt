I keep the tap at the Spread-Eagle, in Grosvenor-street . I put my hat in the bar, on Sunday last, about ten minutes after seven in the evening: it was missed almost directly, and was taken on the prisoner, in Lime-street. He had been in the house, drinking a pint of beer.
I was sitting in the yard, about seven o'clock, at the Spread-Eagle tap. I saw the prisoner go out of the tap-house. My brother desired me to follow him, as he thought he had taken something out of the tap-room. I followed him into Leadenhall-market, and said to him, You have not paid your reckoning. He said he had. I took up his coat, and found the hat under it. He desired me to take the hat, and let him go about his business. I took him back.
That is not the hat I had.
