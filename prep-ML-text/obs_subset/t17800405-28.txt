I am a coachman . On the 23d of March, as I was coming by the end of Gray's-Inn-lane , the prisoner, who was alone laid hold of my arm. She walked with me a little way; she asked me to give her something to drink; as it was cold I consented to that in order to get rid of her. She took me down a place to a house; I said this is not a publick-house; and as I was turning back she came close up to me, and I felt something at my pocket; I immediately caught hold of her arm and said you have robbed me. She blasted my eyes. I brought her out and searched her hand, but could not find it. I met Jones the constable, and gave him charge of her, and we took her to the watch-house and searched her, but found no money upon her. Jones and Jefferys went to the place where she robbed me, and one picked up one of the guineas, and the other the other.
Did any familiarities pass between you?
No; only she began squeezing me.
Might it not drop out?
No; I had more in my pocket.
About three quarters of an hour after the prosecutor gave me charge of the prisoner, I went with him and Jefferys to the place; I picked up one guinea and Jefferys the other.
I told the prosecutor where Mr. Jones lived, upon which he laid hold of me as if I was the woman. I never saw the gentleman before he took me.
