I am carman to Mr. Holyland: On the 27th of January, about half past six in the evening, I had delivered a small cargo of cheese in Tower-street; I went in to get my note signed, and when I came out, I saw the prisoner jump off the shafts of the cart with a cheese under his arm; I pursued him, and saw him drop it; he was taken, and the cheese brought back; I had sixty of the same sort.
I took the prisoner on the 7th of January, at half past six, in Little Tower-street, in\\ I\\ dol-lane; I saw him throw the cheese away. (The cheese produced by the constable).
As I was going along, three men came along with two cheeses, and one was thrown down as I passed by them, and they ran across the way.
