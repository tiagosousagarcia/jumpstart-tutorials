- I am a butcher in Aldersgate-street : On Wednesday the 13th of August, between eight and nine o'clock in the morning, I lost a shoulder of mutton; I was in a little room backwards at breakfast; the prisoner was brought back to me with the shoulder of mutton; I knew it to be mine; I had just before weighed it for a customer.
I am a butcher; I saw the prisoner take the shoulder of mutton from Mr. Brignall's door, and go away with it; he then turned round, and went past the shop with the shoulder of mutton in his hand; I then went into Mr. Brignall's shop, and asked him if he had sold it; one of his servants went with me after the prisoner; I saw him turn into Bell-court; he had it then by the knuckle; we laid hold of him, and brought him back; I am sure the prisoner is the same man; he said he had bought it in Fleet-market.
Was he drunk or sober?
He appeared to be in a state of intoxication, he seemed to have been up all night, he appeared quite stupid.
It appeared to you to be a frolic, did it not, rather than a felony?
No.
