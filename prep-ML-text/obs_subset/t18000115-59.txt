I lodge at No. 8, Blandford-street, Portman-square the prisoner was my servant ; I saw the counterpane a few days before it was stolen; I saw it before the Magistrate on the 3d instant; the tickets were found upon her; she lived with me five months, I had a character with her.
Is your name Baroness?
No, that is my title.
What country are you a native of?
Of Alsace.
Are you reputed to be a Baroness?
Yes.
Are you so called?
Yes.
If you had no title, what would your name be?
Selinus Victory .
Are you married, or single?
Single.
I am a pawnbroker; I have known the prisoner these seven years; she brought me this counterpane to pledge; I lent her seven shillings and sixpence upon it, in the name of Elizabeth Sells; she declared it to be her own property, and I did not doubt it, because she had brought better things than this.
I am an officer belonging to Marlborough-street; I received from the lady eleven duplicates, of which this is one.
This is the duplicate I gave the prisoner.
I know this to be mine, by a tear in the middle; I asked her for the tickets, and she gave them me.
Did you never commission her to pawn any articles for you?
Never.
That you are quite sure of?
Yes, quite.
I pawned it on my mistress's account.
