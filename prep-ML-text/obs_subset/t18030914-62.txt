- I am a broker , No. 6, Orange-street, Golden-square : On the 9th of August, between two and three o'clock, I lost my watch from the parlour; the prisoner was a lodger; she absconded, and I never saw her till the 13th, when she was taken; the watch was found at a watch-maker's.
The prisoner came to me on the 12th of August, and asked me to buy a duplicate of a watch pawned for ten shillings, which she would sell for two shillings; I bought it, and she went with me to take it out.
I am an officer, and apprehended the prisoner; she said she had pawned the watch, and sold the ticket.
I was much distressed, and took the watch and pawned it.
