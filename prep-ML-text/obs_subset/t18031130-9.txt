I live at Acton , am a farmer : On the 6th of November, I had intimation the prisoner, who was my servant , had been lurking about; I found one of the doors of my potatoe-warehouse had been opened, and locked again, by a false key; I found a potato heap greatly disturbed, and I applied for a warrant to search the prisoner's house, which I did; I found near three bushels of potatoes, and two sacks, with my mark on them.
I searched the prisoner's house, and found the potatoes and sacks. (The sacks produced and identified.)
The prisoner always bought potatoes of me, he bought some the day before this happened; I cannot say whether it was a peck or half a bushel, I was out with a cart selling them, and I sold them to his wife.
Did you not lend me a sack when I bought two bushels of peas of you?
I did; and I saw you bring it home again.
