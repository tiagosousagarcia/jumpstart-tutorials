I live at No. 70, New Compton-street , and belong to Covent-Garden theatre: On the 7th of last December, between seven and eight o'clock in the morning, the prisoner was brought to my door with the things in a bundle; the linen was wet.
I am a watchman of St. James's parish, and saw the prisoner come out of Mr. Young's house, between seven and eight o'clock in the morning, with the things; I asked him what he had there; he said, they were his own property; a boy was with him, who ran away, and I caught hold of the prisoner; he did not know I was behind him; I took him to Mr. Young's house; he wanted to give me the things to let him go, but I would not; I knocked at the door, and informed Mr. Young.
I am a Police-officer; I searched him, and found nothing material.
I was coming down Compton-street, and saw that witness with a stick and watch-coat on, and saw the things laying at the door; I spoke to him twice, and he passed me, and let me go two streets off before he took me.
