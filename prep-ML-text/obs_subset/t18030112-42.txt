I am the wife of Job Matthews, a plaisterer : The prisoner worked in our house a great many years; I live in Blackitt, Alms-house, Westminster ; we missed a great many things, there were a great many women washed for us, and I had them all taken up; I got Mr. Bly, the constable, who found at table cloth upon her; the other is at the pawnbroker's. We are laundresses, and take in washing; these table-cloths we had to wash, and are responsible for them; they are both marked.
I am the daughter-in-law to the last witness; I saw these table-cloths in the wash, I know them by the marks.
I am an officer; I received information, about the 16th of December, of the loss of these table-cloths; I apprehended the prisoner, and searched her; I found upon her this table-cloths, it has been out of my possession, but I believe it to be the same, by a mark I observed upon it before I gave it to Mrs. Matthews.
It is the same table-cloth.
I searched the prisoner's room the same day I had the key from her; I found a duplicate of a table-cloth, the 23d of October, I think the pawnbroker has brought the wrong. I went with the pawnbroker to a Mrs. Reddish, in St. James's street, where it was claimed.
I was coming through Chapel-street, and kicked something before me, I picked it up, and it was a table-cloth all over dirt and fifth.
