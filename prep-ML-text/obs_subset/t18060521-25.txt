I live at No. 23, Wellclose-street, Wellclose-square , I am a tinplate worker . Last Thursday night the shoes mentioned in the indictment were hanging in my back parlour, I saw them there at eleven o'clock when I went to bed; about a few minutes after seven George Wheeler came up and received a key of me of the parlour, a few minutes after this Ann Spencer came up with a pair of shoes, and asked me if they were mine, I immediately recognised the shoes as my own; I brought them down stairs, where I saw the prisoner at the bar; I gave the shoes to George Wheeler , and desired him to detain the prisoner; I fetched a constable, and delivered the shoes and the prisoner to the constable.
The shoes were given to me by George Wheeler , I carried them up stairs to Mr. Gardner.
On Friday morning I went to the shop before my master was up, not finding the shop open I went up to Mr. Gardner's bed room door, the entry door was open, and Ann Spencer was up.
What time of the morning was it.
Between seven and eight; Mr. Gardner gave me the key of the parlour, I admitted myself into the parlour, which is the back entrance to the shop, and after I had taken down some of the shutters, I found the parlour door open which I had shut, I went to the parlour door, and the prisoner was standing with his face to the parlour door in the passage, I questioned him what business he had in the house, and whether he had taken any thing out of the parlour, which he denied; the witness Thompson came in, and took a pair of shoes from under his coat, he gave them to me, I called Ann Spencer , she went up stairs with the shoes to Mr. Gardner. The prisoner said he only wanted a drink of water. (The shoes produced and identified by the prosecutor.)
I took the shoes from the prisoner in Mr. Gardner's passage.
He swears to the shoes; I I bought them honestly, I bought them in Rosemary lane, I gave all the money I had for them, which was three shillings and nine pence.
