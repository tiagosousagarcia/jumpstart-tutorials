I live in Tottenham-court-road : I was called down stairs, and asked if I had sold a copper; I had seen the copper at the door not half an hour before: I directly ran down Tottenham court-road, and at the end of Great Russel-street I saw the prisoner with the copper, coming out of Bedford-square into Great Russel-street; it was the same copper that I had lost.
I am an attorney: On the 8th of April I was spending my evening opposite Mr. Frowd's; I had observed the copper at the door some few minutes before; I had asked Frowd the price of it some time before that; I saw the prisoner with the copper, carrying it before him covered with his apron; and from his manner of carrying it, I suspected he had stole it; I looked at Mr. Frowd's and saw that the copper was gone; I went over to Mr. Frowd's, and informed his wife of it; I went after the prisoner, and stopped him going into Russel-street; I asked him where he had that copper from, he said from his master, a Mr. Wilson, I think he said; I said, you have stole that copper; he put down the copper, and at that instant Frowd came up, and the prisoner ran away; I pursued him, and he was brought back.
A copper of mine had fell out of a cart, and I took it by mistake; there were two coppers standing, and I took the wrong one.
