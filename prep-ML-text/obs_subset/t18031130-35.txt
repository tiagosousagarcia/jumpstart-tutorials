I am foreman to Mr. Charles-Hamden Turner, a sail-cloth manufacturer , at Limehouse : On the 30th of September, I gave out twelve pounds of Italian hemp to Hannah Barlow , to spin. On the 1st of October, she was taken in labour. On the 8th of November, she was recovered, and, going to her work again, missed this hemp. On the 11th of November, it was brought to me by Mary Briant to sell, and, knowing it to be my master's property, I stopped it; I went with her and some other persons, and we took the man she bought it of, which is the prisoner at the bar.
I work for Mr. Turner, I received twelve pounds of hemp from the foreman; I was taken in labour, and laid it by in the wash-house. On the 8th of November, I looked for it, and it was gone; I shall know it again.
I am sure this is the same.
This hemp was brought to me by the prisoner, I cannot say the day, it was about a week before I went to sell it to Mr. Gardiner; this is the same hemp, I gave the prisoner four shillings for it.
I had this hemp from Mary Briant , on the 11th of November; there is none in England manufactured in the same way for the same purpose; I know it to be my master's hemp; the prisoner is in the habit of going that way, and could easily have got it.
I never saw this woman before.
The woman is here that paid him the money for it; I was sick in bed.
I saw the prisoner the day Mary Briant bought the hemp of him, I am sure he is the man; I paid him four shillings for it; this woman was sick in bed.
