These things were in the stable; I saw them on Saturday evening; I missed them on Sunday morning; I saw them on Sunday afternoon; they were found, some on the prisoner, there were some at his lodgings; he went and fetched them himself; the silk handkerchief was on the prisoner, likewise the leather breeches.
I lost these things mentioned in the indictment; I saw them again at the public house, and the prisoner was with them, which was on Sunday evening; I swear to the shoes by a nail in the heel.
The prisoner produced a cloth coat, and a pair of shoes he had on; I gave the things to Mr. Hawkins; Hawkins claimed the shoes, and I gave the things to the care of the constable, Peter Hardy .
I bought the things on the road going to my father's.
