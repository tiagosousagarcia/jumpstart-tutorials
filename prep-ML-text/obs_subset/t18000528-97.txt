I am a widow , No. 15, Blue-anchor-yard, York-street, Westminster ; I have a small house at five pounds a year; the prisoner Atherton lodged with me for a fortnight before I lost my property: I went out of an errand, and when I came home I found I was stripped; I went in search of her, and found her; I sent for a constable and detained her; the property was found upon her.
I am an officer: On the 26th of last month, I was sent for to take the prisoner into custody; and in searching the apartments of the prisoner Bessall, I found this box containing part of the property; (produces it;) and in the other prisoner's pocket I found some duplicates, which led to a discovery of the rest of the things.
I am entirely innocent of it; she lent me the cloak and the petticoat; Elizabeth Bessall did not know but what they were my own things.
