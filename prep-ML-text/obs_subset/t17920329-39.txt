I am a linen draper , No. 120, Oxford-street . On the 12th of March I lost nine silk handkerchiefs from the door of my shop; they were affixed to the door post; I saw them five minutes after they had been taken; a person whom I do not know picked them up, and gave them to me: the prisoner was taken immediately by William Earl .
I was passing by Mr. Billett's, the 12th of March, about half past five, and I saw the prisoner take these handkerchiefs off from the door-post; he was going along the street, and rolling them up; I pursued and took him; hearing a person speak to me, he ran across Oxford-road, and dropt the handkerchiefs in the middle of the road; I ran after him, he fell down, and I took him: these are the handkerchiefs.
A man took the handkerchiefs, and chucked them down, and I took them up.
Where do you come from? speak the truth now.
I was born in Bandy-leg-walk; I came out of Drury-lane.
What has been your employment?
I am a leather clog maker , I have been employed by Mr. Crouch, in the Hay-market.
