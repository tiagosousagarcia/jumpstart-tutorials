I live at Shadwell , I am a salesman . On the 24th of June about one o'clock in the day, the prisoner at the bar came into my shop and enquired if I had any yellow handkerchiefs, I shewed her some; after she had looked at them some time, she said she did not want any of them, she would call again; as she was going out of the street door I saw something hang below her clothes, I asked her what she had there, she answered do you think that I have robbed you; I pulled it from under her petticoats, and I saw it was mine. I produce the shift, there is my private mark on it, it had been hanging at the door for sale, I had seen it five minutes before it was taken down.
I was very much in liquor, I did not know any thing about it.
