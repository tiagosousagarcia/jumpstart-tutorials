- I am a baker , and live in Thames-street , at the corner of Harp-lane: On the 23d of September, the prisoner came to my shop, about six o'clock in the evening, in a great hurry, and said, can you give me change for half-a-guinea, or a one-pound note; I said, I don't know; he said, he came up from Blackwall with a fare, being a waterman, and he and his partner should lose it if he could not get change; I said, I would give him change for the note; he said, the note was with the fare at the boat; I agreed to give him change for the half-guinea, which I did, by a seven-shilling piece, two shillings, and a shillingsworth of halfpence; he was gone in a moment, and I immediately discovered it was a bad half-guinea; I run down Bear-Quay-passage, where he said the fare was, but he was not there; I run to St. Dunstan's-hill, and saw the prisoner coming down Harp-lane; I called out stop thief, and he turned back, and run away as fast as he could to St. Mary-at-Hill, where he was stopped by Edwards; he was searched, and found the change of the half-guinea, and about four-pence halfpenny; he begged hard to be forgiven, and allowed it was my change.
I stopped the prisoner when he fell down, and I gave him into custody; he was searched, and said as has been described.
I am an officer, and searched the prisoner, and found the change. This is the bad half-guinea.
This is a counterfeit half-guinea.
