I am shoe-maker . The prisoner worked for me upon Wednesday the 22d of June. I put the things into my shop and locked it up and went out about nine o'clock in the morning; I came home about seven or eight at night, and found the shop broken open. I missed all the things mentioned in the indictment (repeating them) . I had a suspicion of the prisoner, but could not find him till last Tuesday. I asked him how he could serve me so? He said, he was sorry for it, that all the things were in pawn, and I should have them again. I found six of the lasts at No. 1, Fox-court, Gray's-Inn-lane, where his wife lodged. He went with me and shewed me where they were.
He took a stall for me to work in; it was so little I could not pull my arms out. We got to drinking, and I pawned them to get some drink. I was taken up as a deserter, and kept in the barracks till New Year's-day, then I was discharged, having a bad leg.
