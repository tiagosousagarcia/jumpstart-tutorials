On Friday the 30th of June, I missed two gowns and a silk handkerchief from the Three Compasses, Orchard-street, Portman Mews: I lodge there, I had seen them the Sunday before; I found them again the 1st of July, at a pawnbroker's; the prisoner lodged in the same house.
I am servant to Mr. Hyas, pawnbroker, in Nightingale-lane, (produces a cotton gown) ; I took it in of a woman, Ann Stringer, on the 28th of June, it was pawned for 9s.
This is my gown.
