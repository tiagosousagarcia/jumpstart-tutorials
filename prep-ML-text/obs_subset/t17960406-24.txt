I am a servant to Sir John Leicester, in the capacity of a footman , he lives in Piccadilly : I was going into the cellar, on Friday the 4th of March, to draw some small beer, I heard a rustling in the corner of the cellar; I looked behind me and could not discern what it was; I spoke twice, and nobody answered, and I came out, and kept looking behind me, and saw the prisoner start out of a corner; he went towards the beer barrel, and dropped three coats; I took my beer, he followed me, and I turned round and faced him; I asked him what he was doing there? and he said, nothing; I asked him what he was going to do with those clothes? and he said, nothing; I took him by the collar, and brought him into the kitchen; I delivered him up to my fellow-servant, and he took the prisoner, and I went about my business; I let the coats lay in the cellar till they all came to look at them.
Whose coats were they?
Two livery coats belonging to Sir John Leicester, and the other a regimental coat belonging to me; we go out of the servant's-hall into the cellar; I never saw the prisoner to my knowledge before.
You never employed him about the house?
No; he had a pick-lock key taken out of his left hand pocket, it is in Court.
