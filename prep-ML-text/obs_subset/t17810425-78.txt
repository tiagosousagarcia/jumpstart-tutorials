I live with Messrs. Richard and Thomas Speed , who are chymists and druggists , No. 90, Cannon-street. I was carrying a box on the 29th of February, between seven and eight o'clock at night, to the Swan, in Holborn; I pitched it at the Bull's-head, in Bull-head-court, Newgate-street, on a pitching-block. There came a man up to me, and said, My friend, you seem to have a heavy load; will you take part of a pint of beer? I said, I did not choose to go in, I was rather in a hurry to go: he went into the house, and I sat down under the pitching-block. In a little time I rose up with my back to the box: when I turned my face to the box, it was gone. I sat there for about five or ten minutes.
Did you drink there?
No; I went into the house after the man to see if he was there, and he was gone.
Is there another door out of the house?
Yes, there is. I went towards Newgate: I could not see any body with the box. I returned towards Cheapside: I turned up Bagnio-court, in Newgate-street: there I met the man that wanted me to go into the house, and the prisoner; the prisoner had the box on his back coming towards Newgate-street: I heard the other man desire the prisoner to slip down the box as fast as he could, and he said, here is the man, here is the man! so the prisoner slipped down the box, and both made away towards Cheapside. I called out, Stop thief! I pursued the prisoner, and never lost sight of him till I took him at the corner of St. Martin's le Grand. The other man got off, and has not been taken.
I put the things mentioned in the indictment (repeating them) into the box.
Going along Newgate-street, I heard the cry of Stop thief! I saw the prisoner coming towards me. I laid hold of him. Phillips came up directly.
Coming from Oxford-road up Newgate-street, they laid hold of me. I told them I was innocent.
