I keep the Black Swan in Fetter-lane ; I saw the prisoner take the pot out of the tap room, and put it under her cloak, my servant maid found the pot concealed under her petticoats.
I happened to go down for a pint of beer, and I saw the prisoner and a man with her who had a pint of beer in a quart pot, the man went away, and the woman got to the door; I stopped her, and on searching her I found it concealed in her pocket.
