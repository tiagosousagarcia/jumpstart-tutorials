I am the wife of Benjamin Hill, my husband is a collector of rags , he lives at No. 63, Golden-lane : On the 1st of November, the prisoner at the bar passed by my door, and he stole some nails; I keep an old Iron shop; I did not see him take them, a child saw him take them, I don't know the child; I immediately pursued him, and brought the nails back, then I let him go; when I returned, I missed some more, and, with assistance, we searched his apartment in Broadyard, Golden-lane, and found three pans of nails.
How do you know those nails?
Only that I know he took them from my door; he was carrying them openly in his hand.
What does he deal in?
He is a smith by trade; he came in and asked me if I had got any small wire; I said, no; then he came back a second time, and asked for some small rivers; and then he came back the third time, and asked me if I had got any small nails that would make rivets.(The nails produced that were found in the prisoner's apartment.)
You do not know those to be your nails?
I did not see him take them, but there is my mark upon the pans.
I live just by Mrs. Hill, she keeps an old iron shop; I am a journeyman watchmaker; I was standing at the door, and Mrs. Hill asked me if I would fetch Mr. Jones, the officer, and I did, and we found these three pans of nails in the prisoner's room.
I am a paperstainer, I lodge with Mrs. Hill; I went into the shop, and this man was sitting in a chair, and several persons and Mrs. Hill were asking him to confess where the nails were; at last he did, and we found these three pans of nails in one corner of the cellar where he lived; I know the pans, for I frequently helped Mrs. Hill in with them; that is all I know about it.
I am a smith and a nailmaker by trade, I called to look at some nails for a sample; I have got plenty of nails myself in my shop.
