I am butler to Mr. Bushnell; on Monday, the 13th of August, the things were missed from the butler's pantry; I had been absent about an hour, or an hour and an half; I found the prisoner in custody when I came back; there was no part of the house broke.
I am a gentleman's coachman; I was in John Street, and the prisoner passed; somebody gave an alarm, and I did also; he threw down a coat, four waistcoats, a pair of shoes, and a linen table cloth; I have kept them every since.
I am a chairman; I pursued the prisoner and took him.
I am servant to Mr. Bushnell; I saw the prisoner come with a bundle of the things, and I gave an alarm; I did not see him; I came up soon after; he is the lad I saw at first.
I worked at Brentford, as a plumber and glazier; I had been drinking, and coming by the prosecutor's door I heard an alarm, and I ran as others did, but know nothing of the affair.
