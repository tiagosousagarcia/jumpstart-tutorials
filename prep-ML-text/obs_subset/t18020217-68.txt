I live at Malyn: As I was going home on the 17th of February, between ten and eleven at night, I saw a man driving an ass; I looked at it, as I thought it was mine; I did not say any thing, but went home to see if mine was safe; I found it was not there, and I called up my next door neighbours, and we pursued the man and ass, we overtook them near Sunbury; William Fishwater took him by the collar; the prisoner said, you had better let me alone, or it will be worse for you; then I went up, and left James Reason in care of the ass; we took him to the Magistrate on Thursday, and he was committed; I knew the ass well, having had it six or seven years.
I am a labouring man, and went with the prosecutor to apprehend the prisoner; we overtook him at Sunbury with the ass, which I know to belong to Mr. Wicks.
I went with the other two witnesses, and found the prisoner going along the road to Kingston driving the ass, with the foot-sack and cloths upon it; he said it was his, and if I would not leave him alone, it should be the worse for me; I took hold of him, and upon the others coming up, we took him to the Magistrate.
I did not take the ass; another man brought it to me, and then run away and left me.
