I live in Knightsbridge; on the 9th of July I was not at home at the time, I went out at seven, and returned before ten, and missed my things.
I live opposite the prosecutor, my husband and he came home from work; and he has a bit of ground, and they went down to his ground, and in about a quarter after, I saw the prisoner in his room, up two pair of stairs, at the drawers; and in a quarter of an hour afterwards I saw her go out with a bundle; the woman she robbed had been very ill, and she attended her.
I am a watchman, in St. Martin's-lane; I had information from a serjeant of the guards, and I went to the prisoner's apartment, and found on her person these clothes.
Do you think if I stole them, that I should have the impudence to wear them; she lent them to me.
I never lent her any.
