I lost a great coat out of Mrs. Raymond's (a baker's) shop, at Hadley , on the 9th of December; I am her servant ; I heard a cry that a man had run away with a loaf; it was about a quarter past five; I caught him with this great coat under his left arm; it is my coat; I pulled it off about an hour before.
Two men were running by me, and they dropped a coat, and I picked it up.
