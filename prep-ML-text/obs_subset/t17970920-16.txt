- I am the wife of the prosecutor; I live in St. Christopher's alley, Moorfields : I lost the things mentioned in the indictment; they laid upon the top of the bed: On the 2d of August, I was sitting eating my dinner in the room below stairs, and heard a foot go up stairs, I thought it was a lodger, but not hearing the door open with the key, we concluded it was not him; then we heard a woman come creeping down stairs; after she was gone out, I went up stairs to see if any thing was gone, and I missed my gown, my cap, and a ribbon; I cried out that I was robbed, and a young man, Joseph Johnson, went after her and took her; I saw the property again, at the office in Worship-street.
- I rent the house in which Mason and his wife live; hearing somebody go up stairs, and not hearing the door open, I went to the bottom of the stairs, and saw the prisoner coming down; I am certain it was her; there was another woman waiting for her at the door; she said to the other woman, Mrs. Hart was not there.
Is there any such person lives in the house?
No; I know of no such name; I told her she must be a very fancy, impudent woman, to go into any body's house without knocking; Mrs. Mason missed her things, and Joseph Johnson went after and took her.
- Upon hearing the alarm of stop thief, I went out, and saw Mrs. Rudgate standing at the door, and I followed the prisoner, and took her; when I laid hold of her, she gave me the property into my hand directly, and I took her to the office; I have had the property ever since.
