I keep the Three Pigeons in Butcherhall-lane ; on the 18th of July (Wednesday) I lost three quart and seventeen pint pots; my lad was getting them in, and the whole string of pots were stolen.
I was a servant to Mr. Playter; on the 18th of July, between nine and ten in the morning, I went out to gather my pots, and had six quarts and seventeen pints; I fastened my strap with the pots to the bars of a shutter in Little Britain: I always fastened it to that place; when I came to the place I missed my pots, and was informed that the prisoner was taken, and at my master's house. I know they were my master's pots; his name is on the pots.
I am a relation and servant to the prosecutor; I saw the prisoner standing several minutes, and then a man took the pots, and put them into a basket, and the prisoner put it on his shoulder; there were pint pots and quart pots.
The girl was not there when I was stopped.
Yes I was, but I lost sight of him while I went to tell Playter of it.
I am servant to Playter; I was standing in the tap-room of my master's house; when the girl came and informed me, that a man had taken the pots and put them into a basket, and was carrying them away; I pursued him, and took him with the property on him.
I took the man into custody.
I was coming along, and a man asked me to carry them, and said he would give me a pint of beer.
