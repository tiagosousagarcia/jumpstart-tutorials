The property stolen belongs to Oliver Grey, a sailor , who left word with me that I should send his box to his ship at Gravesend: On the 18th of December I sent this box to Mr. Minshaw's, the Dundee-arms, Wapping , and four others, to go by the Gravesend boat; a little after I went down myself, and found one of the boxes missing; I was obliged to go down to settle with the sailor as well as I could; I did not knnow what was in the box; I sent him down other goods for them about four o'clock in the afternoon; I saw the same box again before the Justices at Shadwell, on the Saturday following, the 26th; I did not see it in the possession of the prisoner.
I am a police-officer belonging to Shadwell: On the 19th of December I apprehended the prisoner on another charge; I went to his lodgings; he shewed me the box, and said it was his property; my brother officer has the box; I made enquiry at the Dundee-arms, and found there was a box of that description stolen from thence.
I am a constable belonging to the Police-office, Shadwell: Riley took the prisoner; I received the property from Riley, and have had it ever since.
It contains the property mentioned in the indictment; (repeating them;) here is a waistcoat that I can swear to, which I sold him; and the jacket and trowsers.
That is my own box, and all my own property in it.
When the box was found, it had Oliver Grey 's protection in it, in a pocket-book; and I begged the favour of the Magistrate to let me send it down to him, and he granted the favour; I sent it down to him; he was a black man, and a native of America.
