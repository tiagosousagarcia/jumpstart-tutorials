I am servant to the Rev. Dr. John Breynton , he lodges at No. 63, Edgeware-road , at Mary Ryley 's. On the 26th of June, about 5 minutes before four, I heard somebody lift the key in the door and let themselves in. I thought it was my master, but he is an old gentleman of 74 years of age, and I thought the foot was too quick for him: I came up and met the prisoner; he asked for a woman that was not in the house, and I seized him directly; then he dropped the silver soup ladle, and took out 6 silver table spoons and the gravy spoon, and went down on his knees, and said that it was his first offence; he asked me if I had all the spoons, I counted them over, and there were two more wanting; and he opened his breeches and took out two out of his breeches.
James Webster , who lives next door, came to my assistance; I do not know the value; I never bought any, nor never sold any.
I live next house, No. 64; I happened to be in the garden forward, and heard the word called out, thief. I went to Mrs. Mary Ryley 's; there I found the prisoner on his knees, and saw those spoons taken out; I cannot say to the value.
I am constable. About four o'clock I was fetched, and the prisoner was on his knees begging pardon. I know not the value of the spoons.
There is no evidence as to the value; you must see what the articles are, and judge what the value is.
