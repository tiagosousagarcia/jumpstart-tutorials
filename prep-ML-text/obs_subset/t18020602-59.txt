I am a grocer in partnership with Edward Smith: On Wednesday evening last we sent out a load of goods in a tilted cart; the carman is here.
On Wednesday evening last, the 2d of this month, I received, from Messrs. Searle and Smith's house, a parcel, containing twenty-eight pounds of sugar; when I came to the house of Mr. Dixon, in Queen-street, Soho, I delivered his goods according to the order; while I was looking at the bill, to see the things were right, I saw the prisoner, Joseph Dixon , take twenty-eight pounds of sugar out of the cart, and go away with it; upon which I followed him, and took it from him; he made a stout resistance and then run off; I pursued him, crying stop thief.
Did you lose sight of him?
Yes; he was taken by a person that came up while he was struggling with me; I met them in Moor-street, Seven-dials, bringing him back.
Are you sure he is the same man?
Yes; I saw his face; I know him by his face and his clothes likewise; I am sure he is the same man; he was not out of my sight two minutes.
I never saw that man till I saw him at the watch-house.
