I live in Little Dean's Yard , Westminster; I am housekeeper to Jane Capel Banes , she keeps a boarding-house .
Did the prisoner at the bar live with your mistress's family.
Yes.
How came you to fix any part of this upon the prisoner.
It was found out by the dustman bringing a pawnbroker's ticket to me of a shirt for five shillings, with the name of Broomfield upon it; this was on the 18th of April. I went to the pawnbroker to see who it belonged to, I took the shirt out, I knew it to be one of the boy's shirts, it was marked with permanent ink Thompson; I sent the officer to search Broomfield's room; the prisoner was taken up on some information he got upon this search; the prisoner was searched in my presence, and some duplicates were found upon her.
I am an officer of Queen's square. On searching Broomfield's house, I found they were acquainted with the prisoner, I immediately went back to Mrs. Banes and searched the prisoner, there I found upon her the duplicate of a spoon pledged for seven shillings, a shift pledged for three shillings, two pair of stockings pledged for eighteen pence each, a shirt pledged for six shillings, and a duplicate of a shirt and handkerchief pledged for five shillings, and several other duplicates which relate to another indictment that is against her; I found in her pocket this table spoon, I found in her box two pair of stockings and a prayer book; I then apprehended the prisoner.
I am shopman to Mr. Wright, pawnbroker, in Tothil-street, Westminster; I produce a shirt and a handkerchief pledged by the prisoner for five shillings, and a pair of stockings for eighteen pence, a spoon for seven shillings, a shift for five shillings, a shirt for six shillings, and two handkerchiefs for one shilling.
