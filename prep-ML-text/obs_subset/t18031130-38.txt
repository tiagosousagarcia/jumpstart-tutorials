I am a furniture broker , in Tottenham-court-road : On the 24th of November last, I saw the prisoner in the centre of my my shop; the shop is all enclosed, except two folding doors; I saw him take a set of dome-top dimity bed furniture, which is my property; it was pinned together in a curtain; I saw him go out with it, I ran out after him, and cried stop thief; he run about fifty yards, and threw the bundle away; I let it remain on the ground, and kept pursuing him into Pitt-street, where he went into a door that was open; I ran into the passage, which was dark; I knocked at the door, and asked for a light, which the landlord got me, and I found him on the landing of the one pair; I then took him into custody.
