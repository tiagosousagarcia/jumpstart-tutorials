I am the wife of John Hillery , No. 21, Monmouth-street : Last Saturday morning, the 30th of June, I saw the prisoner go out, down stairs, as I was coming out of my own room, I did not see what room she came out of; I had known her before, I am sure it was the prisoner; I went into my room, and missed the sheet; about an hour afterwards, I saw the sheet again, at Mr. Davis's, a pawnbroker, in West-street, and I knew it again immediately; there is no mark upon it, but I can swear to my own work and the cloth.(The pawnbroker's servant produced the property, which was deposed to by the prosecutrix).
I am an officer belonging to Bow-street; I took the prisoner into custody about eleven o'clock last Saturday morning, in the pawnbroker's shop; I took her to Bow-street, and found fourteen duplicates in her pocket, but none belonging to the sheet; I asked her where that duplicate was, and she said, she had lost it.
I was not at the pawnbroker's at all, I was not out till half past seven o'clock, and then I only went out for a bundle of wood.
