- I am a stone-mason ; I live in St. John's court, George-street, St. George's in the East: at the time I lost this shirt, I slept at the sign of the Phoenix, in Nightingale-lane ; the prisoner was a servant in the house at that time, and as the Officers were searching for some of the things belonging to the landlady, they found a shirt marked in my name; I went and looked at it, and knew it to be mine; I had lost it about six or eight weeks.
- I produce a shirt, pawned on the 31st of October, for 3 s. by Hannah Macdonald .
- Susannah Johnson brought it out to me, and told me, that James the soldier told her to pledge it, to buy herself a pair of shoes.
(To Prosecutor.) Was there a man that lodged in your house called James the soldier?
There were no soldiers in the house at all that lodged there. (The shirt identified by the prosecutor.)
This woman delivered this duplicate to me; she told me she pawned it for the prisoner at the bar.
When I pawned it for her, she told me to keep the ticket, for she was with child by him; I have known her these two years, and I never knew her to be a thief before.
I gave it her to pawn where I was, because I could not go myself, to pay for my lodging; and when Mr. Williams came to pay me, he would not give me more than sixpence a day, I could not sleep in the street.
