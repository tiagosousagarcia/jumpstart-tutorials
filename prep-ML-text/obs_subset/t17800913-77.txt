I am the wife of the prosecutor. The prisoner slept with me; when I went to bed I left the gown upon the horse; the prisoner blew out the candle. which caused me to suspect all was not right. I asked her where the gown was? She said, upon the horse. I put out my hand and found it was not there. I jumped out of bed, upon which she ran off.
I beg the mercy of the court, I have no friends here.
