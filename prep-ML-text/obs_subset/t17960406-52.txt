I live in Mark-lane; about the 12th or 13th of February, I was moving out of one house into another, from Cooper's-row to Mark-lane; I lost a pair of shoe-buckles; I suspected it was some of the workmen that were working in the house, and I desired the servant to keep a look-out; and on the 19th of February, in the morning, in consequence of some information that I received, the prisoner was taken before the sitting Alderman, and I went with the officer to search the prisoner's lodgings, in Butler's-buildings, East-Smithfield; I saw the constable take out of his wife's pocket, a pair of silver shoe-buckles; out of the drawer in the table, was taken a pair of worsted stockings of mine; and out of the cupboard in the room, a pocket map of London.
At the time you went to Whitechapel, was the prisoner in custody?
He was.
I was his wife these things were found upon?
Yes.
Were not there other persons lodged in this house?
I never was in the house before, and I don't know any thing of it.
I am a constable; I went with Mr. Allnutt to search the house; I did not execute the warrant, I was present at the search; in the table-drawer was found a pair of worsted stockings, some knives and forks hid under some coals, a map of London, a walking-cane, and some candles.
I am an officer belonging to the Public-office Whitechapel, I assisted the search-warrant; I found, in the prisoner's wife's pocket, these buckles; and a pair of worsted stockings in the table-drawer; and up stairs I found this map. (producing them)
You do not know how many persons lodged in this house?
Only one.
I found some knives and forks hid under some coals, and I saw the prisoner take them.
The property being found upon the prisoner's wife, and not upon him, I cannot state to you that there is any evidence to affect the prisoner with the crime of felony.
