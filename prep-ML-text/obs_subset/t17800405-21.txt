I lost the things mentioned in the indictment about a week or ten days before Christmas. My wife employed the prisoner to do some work for her. My wife let her sleep in our room; and she got up in the night and robbed her.
Where do you lodge?
In Bishops-court, in the Old Bailey ; we have only one room; she dressed herself in my wife's clothes and left her own.
When did you miss her?
In the morning between five and six o'clock, when I got up to go work. My wife knows what was taken away better than I do.
I employed the prisoner to work for me; she lay in our room; when I got up in the morning she was gone, and I missed all the things mentioned in the indictment (repeating them.) I have never found any of them since.
When was she taken up?
About three weeks ago; when she was taken up she denied knowing any thing of me; here are her clothes she left when she went away.
How do you know they were her things?
Patrick Bewley She came dressed in them the day before.
Whether she did not bring Sarah Gahagan to swear against me at Guildhall; and she took her oath she knew nothing of me?
She said she saw her go out with my clothes on her back, and the kettle in her hand.
Did she say that she did not know the prisoner?
I did not hear her say any such thing.
If the constable which took me was here he would tell you the same.
Is the prisoner the person who went away and left her clothes?
Yes; Sarah Gahagan would not come because I could not pay her for being here yesterday.
As to what I have laid against me I am innocent of it; I lodged at this gentlewoman's mother's; she is a drunken turbulent woman, though I drink a little sometimes myself; this woman's mother knocked me down in the street. I went to the prosecutrix's house at two o'clock, and asked her to let me in? She did not like to let me in; but at last she did, and bid me not let her husband see me there in the morning. Please to ask them if I did not bring other things to put on instead of those I left?
She did not.
