I am an oilman , in Newgate-street. A trunk, with linen to wash, was sent from my house, to go, by the Hammersmith coach, to Hammersmith, on the 23d of April.
I live at Kensington . On the 23d of April, at about half after seven at night, as I was crossing the way, I heard the cry, Stop thief! stop thief! I saw the prisoner coming, running very fast along the highway; I laid hold of him, and stopped him: he said, What have I done? and fell a crying: a man immediately came up, and took him from me, and he was carried to the watch-house.
I am the driver of the Hammersmith coach. On the 23d of April, I had Mr. Wiseman's trunk behind my coach; I set out from London about six o'clock; when I came to the Adam-and-Eve, I missed the trunk; I turned my head, and saw the prisoner running towards London, with the trunk in his arms; he was about the distance of the length of this court from my coach; I jumped off the box, and ran after him, and cried, Stop thief! stop thief! upon which he threw down the trunk; some people ran out of the Adam-and-Eve like men, and ran smartly after him; I secured the trunk, and they brought the prisoner back to me.
I heard the alarm of Stop thief! I saw several people before me, so I ran on very briskly; I never had the trunk.
