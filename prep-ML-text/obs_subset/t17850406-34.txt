I am a slop-seller , on the 16th of March last, the prisoner and a woman came in to buy something; I did not observe them at the first; there were some loose jackets laying on the counter, and the prisoner said to me, what is the price of them great coats, I said, they are jackets; I shewed him the jackets, and he agreed to give me nine shillings for one, and the woman said, he wanted some trowsers and shirts, I shewed them some different sorts of shirts, and they laid out three, one of each sort, and agreed for the price; the prisoner said, he had no money, but would fetch it; I went after him in about a minute, and found him and kept at a distance, and when he came to the top of the street, he pulled out this shirt from under his great coat; it was not in paper, the same woman was with him, but she run away.
I bought the shirt of a woman, and gave her four shillings for it, and a pot of beer.
