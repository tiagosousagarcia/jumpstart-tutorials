I live in the Poultry ; I know nothing of it myself, only that it is my dwelling-house.
I am porter to Mr. Cowling, a haberdasher : On the 25th of September, about seven o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner in the act of cutting open a truss; he ran away, I pursued him, and caught him near the Mansion-house; I never lost fight of him till he was taken by the constable; the passage door was open; he had not time to take any thing out.
I never was on that side of the way at all.
