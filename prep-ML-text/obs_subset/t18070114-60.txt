What are you.
I am a plumber ; this cistern was at the landing, outside of my door: my shop lies in the mews. It was a little cistern that I made for a gentleman, he wanted some alteration; it had only been put to the door that morning to be sold.
As I came out of Grafton mews I saw the cistern at my master's door, I saw a man take it from the door and put it down on the flags.
You mean the foot path.
Yes, this was the day before Christmas day. I saw this man speak to a milkman, what he said I do not know; the milkman put it upon the top of the prisoner's back, when I saw him go off with the cistern; I went round Fitzroy market and met him, I said what are you going to do with this cistern; by Jasus, he said, I do not know; I said, my friend carry that cistern back where you took it from and start off.
Did he carry it there.
No, I told him to clap it down upon a bundle of hay that was just by, and start off directly; he took the knot off his shoulder and began to run, I knocked him down. I secured him myself and took him to goal.
Are you sure that is your master's cistern.
Yes.
You did not perform your promise with him, you told him to start off, and after he put the property down you knocked him down.
He tossed it off his shoulder and injured the cistern.
If he had put the cistern down upon the bundle of hay you would not have knocked him down.
I should not.
