I am servant to Mr. Sowerby, a pawnbroker , in Davis'-street, Welclose-square, Whitechapel , on the 27th of July, the prisoner came to pledge something.
- I was in the shop, and saw the prisoner take the shawl down, and put it into her pocket; when there was a piece of work about it, she dropped it from under her cloaths.(The shawl produced and identified.)
I was in the shop which was full of people, they accused me with it, but I know nothing about it.
