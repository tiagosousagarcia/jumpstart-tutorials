I am the wife of the prosecutor, a copper-plate printer , in Bear-alley, Fleet-Market : On Saturday morning, the 3d of April, I saw the things hanging on a line in the lower room on the ground floor, between eight and nine in the morning; I found the prisoner concealed in that room on the ground behind a cradle, and I pulled the calico bed-gown and muslin handkerchief out of her pockethole, and threw them on the ground; I had not left the room above five minutes; I sent for a constable, and left the things lying on the ground; when the constable came, I delivered them to him, he has had them ever since.
Were you out of the room at all?
Yes.
Did you leave any body in the room?
Yes, several people; Martha Beck is here; I left her in the room; I know the bed-gown by the mark in it; I had mended it.
I live next door to Mrs. English; I went into the house with her for a pail of water, she found the door open, and was very much frightened; she looked about and could not find any body, and then I saw a woman lying behind the cradle; I did not see any thing upon her; I went out to call some assistiance in; when I came in again, there was a calico bed gown, and a muslin handkerchief upon the floor; Mrs. English charged her with taking them, and she denied it.
I am a constable, (produce a bed-gown and a handkerchiefs); it was et. and when I searched her, I found this binding; Mrs. English gave charge of her, I found them upon the floor; (they were deposed to by the prosecutor).
I went to enquire of this gentlewoman for one Mrs. Rigge; she said I was a thief, and looked among her things, and she struck me several times, and to be sure I abused her, and she sent for a constable.
