I am a linen-draper . The printed callico mentioned in the indictment was in my window, on the 3d of May. At about eight in the evening, the prisoner came into the shop, and asked for some clear lawn. I observed, when she went out, that she had something which she endeavoured carefully to conceal. As soon as she was gone out, I missed five yards of printed callico. I pursued her, and saw her drop the callico. She was immediately taken into custody.
What is the callico worth?
Two shillings and sixpence a yard; there are five yards of it.
Another young woman and I went into the shop, and bought a piece of lawn. I know nothing about the callico.
