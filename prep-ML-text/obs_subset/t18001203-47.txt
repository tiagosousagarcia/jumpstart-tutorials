I am the wife of Henry Cox: I rent a room at a hair-dresser's shop, Greenbank, Wapping , my husband is at sea ; I went with my husband to Gravesend, and the prisoner was in a house there, and seeming a decent woman, she asked me to let her lodge with me, and I said she might; she lodged with me seven weeks, I was not to have any thing for it; as soon as she was gone away, I looked in my box, and missed my, cloak, it was found upon her the same night, the officer found it pinned inside of her top petticoat.
- I am an officer belonging to the Thames Police-office: On Wednesday the 19th of November, I was sent for to search the prisoner, she requested that I would let the women that were present, search her, and they searched her, and found this cloak upon her, pinned to her petticoat.(Produces it.)
This is my cloak.
I borrowed her cloak to go out, as I had often done before, I did not mean to steal it; I thought to have slipped it into the box again without her knowing it.
