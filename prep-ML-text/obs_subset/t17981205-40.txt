Are you a clergyman ?
Yes, On Saturday, the 3d of November about, twelve o'clock, as I was going through Cornhill , near the print-shop, I perceived something touch my coat pocket on the right hand side with a jerk; I put my hand in my pocket, and found my handkerchief gone; I immediately turned round and found a young man behind me attempting to conceal something; I challenged him with having taken my handkerchief.
Who was that young man?
The prisoner at the bar; I told him he had taken my handkerchief; I then saw it drop from behind him; I took it up; I then took him by the arm, and told him he should go before a Magistrate; there was a constable on the opposite side of the way came over, and said, he would save me the trouble, he would take him; I went before the Lord-Mayor, and he was committed; I delivered the handkerchief to the constable.
I am a constable: On the 3d of November, about twelve o'clock, I saw Mr. Wright take hold of the prisoner by the arm; I went up to him, and he informed me the prisoner had picked his pocket of his handkerchief; I took charge of him, and took him before the Lord-Mayor; Mr. Wright had the handkerchief in his hand, which he gave to me, (produces it) I have had it from that time to this.
This is my handkerchief, there are the initials of my name at the corner, T W.
I was coming along, there was another young man standing by me, and this gentleman happened to lay hold of me instead of the other young man; I know nothing of it, he catched hold of the wrong person.
