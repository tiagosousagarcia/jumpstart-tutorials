I keep a house in High-street, St. Giles's ; the prisoner took a lodging in my house, with another person, they used to pay the rent separately, one half, and the other half, generally; the other woman was in the room some time before the prisoner, they both worked with me in the fur trade , pre paring skins for furriers; this woman agreed to pay half the rent.
Were they both liable to pay the whole?
No, neither of them to pay the whole.
Then, Gentlemen, you must acquit this prisoner, because the indictment should charge a contract made by the party, but the witness states, that they were each liable to pay half, but they should both have been liable to the whole; it appears to me, that under these circumstances, they were separate tenants, they were not joint tenants, each liable for the whole, and that therefore, the prisoner ought to be acquitted.
