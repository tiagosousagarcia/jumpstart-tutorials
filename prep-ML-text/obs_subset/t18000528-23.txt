How long has the prisoner been in your custody?
Five weeks.
What has his demeanor been?
The moment he came in, he was exactly as you see him now, and he has appeared in the same deranged state ever since I have had him.
Have you been in the habit of seeing persons in a deranged state?
I have seen many.
Has he remained, during the time you have had him, quite insane?
That is my opinion.
I am the brother of the prisoner; my brother has been in his state of mind between eight and nine years.
What has been his general demeanor?
He has been afflicted in a kind of stupid, heavy, way, as a lunatick; the first particular thing we observed of him, was, drinking a vast quantity of water; he had a fancy in his head that he was poisoned.
Did you endeavour to convince him he was mistaken?
Yes, but it had no effect, he continued so for near a fortnight; he used to drink four or five quarts of water, one after another, he was confined in St. Luke's twelve months, and was sent away as incurable.
