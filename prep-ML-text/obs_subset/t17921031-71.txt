I keep a green grocer's shop ; I know the prisoner; he was servant to Mrs. Sarah Andrews , she lives in the neighbourhood; I know her very well, she keeps a publick house I had my beer there; the prisoner came to my house about nine o'clock on the 3d of October last, Tuesday, and said his mistress would be much obliged to me to let her have two guineas worth of silver, as his mistress was busy, as some of the watchmen were not paid; he said my mistress will send you the money up by and by; I told him I could not spare above one guinea's worth, which I gave him, seven half crowns, three shillings, and one sixpence; I saw him about ten days after in his mistress's house with the constable.
I am a widow woman; the boy was a servant of mine; on Tuesday, 12th of October, he had lived two months; we had a very good character with him; I gave him no orders to go to Mr. Astill that day; I was not up, it was between eight and nine in the morning; I never saw him all the day; on the Saturday before I had given him several guineas to change, and he brought them, but he had no orders that Tuesday; he quitted my house that morning a little after eight, and never returned.
I am the constable; in consequence of Mrs. Andrew speaking to me, I found, the boy last Friday, in Turnmill street; I found him in a hay loft, according to directions; he confessed it as soon as I took him to his mistress's house.
I am willing to make it up in my work when I am in work.
