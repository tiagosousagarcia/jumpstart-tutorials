I am a housekeeper at Edmonton , I lost the pap spoon and the two tea spoons, I was not at home.
I am a breeches-maker; the prisoner used to chare at the prosecutor's; on Wednesday, about eight, or between eight and nine, I overtook the prisoner at the Bull at Tottenham High Cross, I accused her with the spoons, and she gave me three spoons out of her pocket, and she said she was very sorry, and could not think what induced her. I told her it would be better for her.
I was going home in the evening, and called to know if my mistress had any thing for me to do, and I found them the next morning in my little girl's pocket, and I was going to take them home.
She was going from my house towards town.
