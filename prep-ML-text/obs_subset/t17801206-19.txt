I am the wife of Anthony Allam , I had washed the linen on the 22d of November, and placed them to dry. I heard a noise in the yard; I came out; I saw the prisoner at the bar; I assisted in holding him till a constable was sent for.
I was walking in a garden which adjoins this place, the back of Ormond-street. I went into the yard, and I saw the prisoner in the prosecutor's yard; he turned his back towards me, but as he was running away, the linen being wet, one of the shirts tumbled between his legs, which made him stumble, and was near throwing him down; I turned round full upon him; I then saw he had a bundle of linen. I seised him. He ran near the pales, where there was an accomplice ready to have received this linen. I held him till I had the assistance of Mr. Allam. Afterward a constable was sent for.
I met the prisoner together with the other persons, near the Foundling-Hospital.
My hat blew over these pales; I went into the yard to get it again.
