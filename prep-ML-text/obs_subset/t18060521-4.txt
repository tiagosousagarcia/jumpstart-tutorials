I lodge at the Fox, in Wardour-street, Soho .
Did the prisoner live near you.
Yes, in the same house in the three pair of stairs room, and I lived in the two pair of stairs. On the 19th of April I went down to Margate, and I returned on the 26th; I missed my property on the 28th, I took a clean striped cotton shirt to a pawnbroker's, and asked him if he had got any striped cotton shirts or handkerchiefs pawned at his house in the course of the week, he told me had one, it had been fetched out half an hour before I came there, I went to another pawnbroker's, he told me that two of the handkerchiefs that I had described were fetched out that morning, and he had one left, I asked him to stop the person that pawned them and send to me, which he did, and the prisoner was taken to the office in Marlborough-street; after that she owned to the three handkerchiefs and the two shirts that she had taken out of my box.
I live at No. 25, Great Windmill-street, I keep a sale shop.
Look at the prisoner at the bar, did you ever see her before.
I think so, she came to me on the 28th of April with an old check shirt, said her husband had gone to sea and left her, I told her it was not good enough; she asked me if I bought silk handkerchiefs, she had the ticket of three in her hand, she said she would bring them, instead of bringing three she brought but two, a cotton handkerchief and a silk one; I produce them; I am sure I had them of the prisoner. (The property identified by the prosecutor.)
I was in distress when I took them, I had not a bit of bread to eat for my child nor myself.
