I am a soldier; and was on guard down at Limehouse-hole: At nine o'clock. I saw the prisoner coming out of the fourth story of the warehouse, down the ladder; when he got down, I examined him, and found twenty pounds weight of nails; I took them and him to the guard-room; going along, he said, he had a wife and family, and hoped I would let him go; he said, somebody had put the nails in his basket, he did not know how they came there.
These are a sors of nails we use at the New Docks, and they belong to Mr. Wharton, the carpenter; the prisoner had worked there about twelve months, and was a steady man; our regular time is till seven o'clock, but we were in a hurry, and allowed the men to work as long as they could see.
Were you sober, or not?
Sober, or I should not have been placed on the sentry. The nails were covered with chips; I did not call to him till he came to the bottom.
I was at my cutting board, and saw the prisoner's wife come up in a fright, and the soldier behind her; she said to her son, you dog, you have lost the key; that was merely an excuse to get rid of the soldier; he said, I can open the door, and wanted to get into her room.
Is any part of this true?
No; the whole is this; I and several comrades passed the door, and I said, this is the house where the prisoner's wife lives, and went away directly.
The woman came in a great fright, and said, I expect the soldier down here every minute, he is just behind; in about five minutes, somebody knocked; I said, who do you want; says he, I want the woman, who is just come in; she sat in the shop; and he said, he could not come in, he was so bashful; my uncle heard him; and our apprentice heard him say, he could break the door open.
