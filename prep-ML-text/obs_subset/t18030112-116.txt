I live at No. 2, John's-row, St. Luke's, my husband, William Wright , is a labouring man : I let a lodging to the prisoner on the 4th of December, a front room, furnished, and all the things mentioned in the in dictment; she staid till the 9th, and went away about half past two o'clock; I had a suspicion, and took a key which I always keep, and called a neighbour, and opened the door, and found the things gone.
I live with Mr. Clarke, and produce a blanket and two curtains, pledged by the prisoner.
I have nothing to say; I leave it to the mercy of the Court.
