Who had got the custody of the ass when you saw him?
This woman, the prisoner at the bar, was leading of it, and the other was leading of it with a bridle; when I came there I met them, the top of Seymour-street, my Lord stopped the ass himself, I was not there, my Lord sent for me to meet him.
So it was some time before you saw it afterwards?
It was stopped about a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes; and the ass was my Lord's.
Have you any reason to suppose that this woman took it?
Only by its
being found on her. We lost three asses that same time last year.
I was coming down below Harrow on the Hill ; I met this gipsy, I had a little lame horse, and they asked me whether I would chop this little lame horse for this ass? and I did; as I was coming along the high road the next day, there was a gentleman met me, and asked me whether I would fell this property? and he left me a card where to bring it. I never was in London before, they took me up at such a nonplus, and my husband being in the militia, that I don't know where to send to him. I have six small babies.
