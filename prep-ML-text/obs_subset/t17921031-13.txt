I am a letter founder in Bream's-buildings, Chancery-lane, I can only speak to the property.
I am a printer; on the 19th of October the prisoner came to my shop and wanted to sell some types, I asked him how he came to sell such a quantity; I live in Russell-court Drury-lane; he told me his brother was a printer and was dead, that this was all that was left; I asked him who had bought the rest, he said his sister had sold them, and he could not tell to whom; he seemed flurried, and desired I would give them to him again; I said I would not till he gave a better account of himself; he took to his heels and ran up the court, and I pursued and took him to Bow-street; going into the office he said he had told me a lie, that he had no brother a printer, he was a founder; I have kept them ever since.
How old are you?
Twelve, Sir.
What becomes of boys who tell lies?
Go to a bad place, Sir.
I am servant to Mr. Stephenson; I set up the letters; I put the letters upon a stick to be dressed; I was carrying the things home; I set them down at the corner of Bedford-bury; it was on a Thursday, about six o'clock; I had three parcels, which I took from my master's in Bream's buildings, and was to carry them to Orange-street, Leicester-fields: at the corner of Bedford-bury, I asked the man to help me with the types on my head; yes, my lad, says he, they are very heavy; the prisoner is the man; he asked me where I was going; I said, to Orange-street, Leicester-fields; he said he would take one for me; he had two, I had one; at the corner of St. Martin's-lane , he put it out of his right hand into his left; I said, Sir, there are two; no, says he, there is not; I will run back, I can run faster than you; I ran after him, and he gave me the dodge; I lost him; I am not sure the prisoner is the man; I believe he is the man.
I am sure this is my type, the letter X has a flaw in it.
