I am a watch-maker . I missed a watch on Tuesday morning; I saw it on the Monday evening before I lighted candles on my work-board in the shop. I saw it again last night at the office in Bow-street; I immediately knew the watch, it was my own making.
I am a constable. The pawnbroker who has the watch is not here. Yesterday afternoon the pawnbroker, whose name is Wood, sent to the office that he had a woman in custody. I went, and saw the prisoner there. He had stopped a watch. I took the prisoner to the office. She said her brother gave it her. I found a letter in her pocket with a direction on it to her brother. I said I would go and fetch her brother. She then cried, and desired to speak to the Justice, and said she had it not from her brother, but out of Mr. Stuart's shop. I went to Mr. Stuart, the watch was produced to him, and he swore positively it was his.
I have no witnesses.
