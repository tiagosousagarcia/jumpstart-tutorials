I am an officer: On Saturday, the 13th of this month, I was going up White Lion-street, into Leman-street, when I saw the prisoner, Groome, and his waggon, stop; I saw him untie the tail of it, and take a sack of coals upon his back; \" Benjamin Grainger and Son\" were wrote on the waggon; I followed the nman, with the coals upon his back, into Rosemary-lane; he carried them into Mr. Allen's potato warehouse, he came out again with the sack empty, and put it into his waggon; I then asked him what had had been carrying that sack of coals there for, and desired him to shew me his ticket, which he would not do; I told him it would be better for him to take the coals up again, and he would not, but persisted in going on; I told him, he should not, and I secured him; he then gave me the ticket, (produces it) \"Waggon, No. 5, Sept. 13, 1800 - Sir, please to receive 35 sacks of coals, from your humble servant, Benjamin and Pressey Grainger. To M. Ward. Esq.\" I counted the sacks in the waggon, and there were but thirty-four.
On the 13th of September, I was sent for to take charge of the prisoner; he said, it was the first time he had ever stole any, and now it was through distress, for he had a large family.
I keep a potato-warehouse in Rosemary-lane: On the 11th of this month, I went to a man, of the name of Robinson, for seven shillings that he owed me, and he asked me if I wanted a sack of coals; he used to deal in coals; and I agreed that he should send me a sack, and he gave me the difference; and when the prisoner came ro me with the coals, I asked him, who he brought them from, and he said, from Mr. Robinson.(Mr. Pressey Grainger proved the firm, and gave the prisoner an excellent character).
Robinson has gone out of the way.
