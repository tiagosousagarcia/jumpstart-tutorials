I keep a shop at Battle-bridge; I bought two flats of butter of Mr. Strickland, in Newgate-market ; we always return the basket and the cloths; we are responsible for them; I was having the butter booked to me; and, as I was looking through Mr. Strickland's window, I saw the prisoner take the basket; I gave an alarm, and he was brought back; I am sure he is the same man.(Edward Harris corroborated the testimony of the prosecutor.)(The constable, who took the prisoner with the property upon him, produced it, and it was identified by the prosecutor.)
I heard an alarm, I was running, and they laid hold of me.
