I am a carpenter ; I lost my tools in the indictment, the 7th of July, out of our work-shop; I found them some few minutes after, on the man that took them, that is the prisoner, the saws were mine beyond all doubt:
I saw the man come out of the shop with the saws under his coat, that was the prisoner; there was nobody in the shop, I was in the street at the same time.
I met a man, and he desired me to take the saws, and put them under my arm, and the oil-stone, and wait for him; coming across, I was met by that young gentleman, and taken into custody.
