I am a shoe-maker , I lost a pair of boots from the outside of the shop.
I was in the parlour adjoining the shop, I was called and told a pair of boots had been stolen, I pursued the prisoner, and he ran round the corner of the next court.
On the 20th day of July I heard the cry of stop! I saw the prisoner running, he dropped a pair of boots; a boy (Harvey) picked them up.
I live with a poulterer, I saw the prisoner drop the boots; I picked them up.
I took the boots to the watch-house, and laid them on the table.
About twelve in the day, a pair of boots were brought to the watch-house by Mrs. Morse, I delivered them to the constable.
I have kept these boots ever since.
I saw the prisoner take the boots from Mr. Morse's window.
Another man just before me dropped the boots.
