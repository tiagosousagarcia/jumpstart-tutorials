I am the wife of William Parker , a publican : On Saturday the 26th of April, I lost a tea-spoon; the prisoner and another woman came in for a pint of beer; the prisoner came into the bar, and when she was gone, I missed a ten-spoon.
I am servant to Mr. Clinker, pawnbroker, in Crown-street, Finsbury-square; I took in a tea-spoon from the prisoner, on the 26th of April, in the evening, I lent her two shillings upon it, (produces it.) I am sure the prisoner is the person.
That is my spoon, I know it by the mark, I had used it that evening.
I picked it up at the door, and pledged it in my own name.
