I am a publican in Old Quebec-street : On the 29th of January, about four o'clock in the afternoon, in consequence of information, I followed the prisoner, and stopped her with a quart and a pint-pot under her apron; they have my name upon them. (Produces them.)
I belong to Mary-le-bone watch-house; the prisoner was brought to me at the watch-house.
I beg for mercy.
