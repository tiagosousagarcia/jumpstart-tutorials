I am a shoe-maker , I live at No. 97, White-cross-street, St. Luke's : On Wednesday the 13th of January I lost a pair of shoes.
Had you seen the shoes that day?
I hung them on the window myself; they were men's shoes; I hung them there about nine o'clock in the morning, and missed them at one o'clock the same day; I was informed by a person that I had been robbed; these are the shoes, (produces them;) I am quite confident they are my shoes; I bought them among a lot; I had not such another pair of shoes in the shop.
What is there remarkable in the shoes?
They are very badly made and closed; they are bad altogether.
You would not swear there are not many others made like them?
No.
About one o'clock, while I was standing at my own shop, nearly opposite to the prosecutor's, I saw the prisoner at the bar standing at the corner of his window.
Did you know the prisoner before?
Yes; he stood there under the appearance of making water; he had his head fixed in Mr. Smith's window; I saw him snatch, or cut the shoes from the window, put them under his coat and run away; he was perceived by me and another man, the other man followed him closer than I did; he threw the shoes away, the other man picked them up; I pursued him, but I did not take him till two nights following, Friday the 15th.
Where the shoes picked up when he threw them away?
Yes, immediately.
Do you know whether these are the shoes?
Yes, I marked them myself; I am sure these are the shoes.
You say, he was not taken till Friday the 15th?
No.
Had you seen him between Wednesday and Friday the 15th?
I had not.
Where was he taken?
The corner of Whitecross-street; Smith and I took him ourselves at the King's-arms public-house.
That is in the neighbourhood?
Yes.
Have you known him before - what is he?
I understand he is a carpenter, he said he lived somewhere about Old-street.
You have no doubt about the person of the man?
None at all.
I wish my witnesses to be called.
