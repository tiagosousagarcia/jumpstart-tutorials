I am the wife of Francis Hack; the property was hanging in the yard between five and six o'clock; I saw the prisoner come into the yard, and take them off the line; upon her seeing my husband come to the door, she threw them down, and he apprehended her.
I am a headborough; I was sent for to take charge of the prisoner.
