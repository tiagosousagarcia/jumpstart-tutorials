I am a ballast-digger ; I lost my watch out of my bed-room, in my father's house, at Finchley : On the 14th of this month, I hung it over my head, and, in the morning, it was gone; the duplicate of the watch was found upon him by Wallace; the prisoner slept in the same room with me.
I work in the gardens: I went after the prisoner, and took him at Mill-hill; I asked him what he had done with John Harris 's watch, and he told me, he did not know; I asked him whether he had fold it, or pawned it, and, he said, he had pawned it, and gave me the duplicate.
I am a pawnbroker in the Strand, (produces a watch) I took it in of the prisoner at the bar, on the 15th of September, in the evening.
This is my watch.
