I lodged, the 10th instant, at No. 11, in Fleet-lane ; I lost a pair of velveret breeches, and two cloth waistcoats; they were taken out of the room where I lodge; I saw them there on the 9th, at night; in the morning I missed them; they were found on the prisoner; I never knew the girl; she was taken up with these clothes upon her; her mother lodged in a room in the house, and I believe she came to see her mother; I did not hear any body come in; there were two children slept in the room.
I am a watchman; last Tuesday was se'nnight, between five and six in the morning, I stopped the prisoner with these things upon her; I took her to the watch-house; she sent some message to the prosecutor not to appear against her at the Justice's.
I know these things are my father's property.
Being an unfortunate girl, I was away from my mother; so about four or five I went up to my mother's room to see if she would take me in; as I went up I met a man in a brown coat and a round hat, and brown apron round him; and he asked me to take them to a pawnbroker's; as I was going up Queen-street when the watchman stopped; he saw the watchman before I did, and he run away; I told the watchman it was nothing belonging to him; he said let me see what it is, and he took me to the watch-house.
