You are an officer of excise ?
Yes.
In consequence of an information you received, you went into the King's Bench prison ?
Yes; on the 31st of December last, three went in first, and three more came in afterwards, in five or ten minutes; there was Mr. Stainsforth, and myself, and George Barrow , they were all officers of excise; Griffiths came after me, and the marshal was with us; I went into the prisoner's apartment, No. 6, in 15, up one pair of stairs, and there was some candles on a rod; the prisoner was there, and his wife, and his two children, all in a room eating their dinner; there were about one hundred and fifty or one hundred and sixty rods of candles, about one hundred and forty or one hundred and fifty pounds weight; Barrow, and me, and two of the marshalmen went into his room, and then they left me in possession of these candles; there was what they call a dipping mould to make candles, and a tin kettle to melt the tallow in, and there were about forty or fifty pounds weight of candles in boxes; there was some cotton spread, for first dipping as we say; some few spread for first wetting, and there were cottons that were dressed, ready for spreading; and there was cottons in balls, that is, before they are dressed, and there was a stage all round the room, to put the candles on when he made them; I took possession of the candles and the cottons and every thing, and shewed him the warrant; he said but very little, but he went out of his room, and in less than five minutes returned with a number of prisoners with him, I suppose five or six rushed in like a torrent with him, and they took away the candles that were on stages, and he himself took a part of them also; he said he would have the candles, or perish, or die, or some expression to that purpose; I told them at their peril so to do, that they must stand to the consequence, I had seized them for the King; they did take them away all on the rods, with the dressed cotton; and he returned with others to take away the boxes; by that time one of the marshalmen came to his room to my assistance, and stood at the door way and prevented him; then he goes down stairs; there was a large number of people; the prisoner went below, and some of the other officers came up to my assistance; then the remainder of the candles that were in the boxes were taken away by the other officers; the name of the officer that was with me was William Griffiths , and William Smith , and one or two more which I am not sure of, and some of the marshalmen; Griffiths had a part of the candles that were in the boxes, Smith had another part; I had the dipping mould, I went first with the dipping mould, Griffiths followed me out of the room, I ran into the front yard with the dipping mould, as fast as I could; I got out of the prison, and William Smith , I believe, followed me with a small box of candles; before I got out of the prison I heard a noise and tumult behind me; I turned into the prison, and left the dipping-mould without; I saw a great mob in the prison.
What is your reason for knowing it to be his room?
Because it is marked, I think, over his door, No. 6; he was there, and had his bed there.
I have no bed, I was obliged to sell my bed through distress, to maintain my family?
He said he must do something to maintain his wife and children.
I am an officer of excise; I know the prisoner, I saw him in a room in the King's Bench, I observed no particular mark on the room; there was Mr. Whitehead, Tucker's wife, and I suppose his two children; the prisoner was not there, I saw two boxes in the room with candles, I opened them, and saw candles in them; there was a dipping mould, and tin kettle, which I suppose the tallow was melted in, was greasy inside; there was some cotton upon two or three rods to hang candles on; I saw the prisoner again, he came to the room after I was there, he wanted to force himself into the room, but was prevented by one of the keepers; there were several people with him; the cotton and things were put into the boxes, and we all took some; Whitehead came first, I had a box of candles, I carried it down to the bottom of the stairs before me in my arms; at the bottom of the stairs I saw Tucker, along with a great many other people, and he took hold of the box, and endeavoured to take it away from me; I had a tussle with him for a few minutes, in hopes some person would come to my assistance; but none coming, Tucker and the other people that were with him, took away the box from me; he first took hold of the box, and then afterwards finding I would not let go the box, he struck me on the side of the head; I was afterwards knocked down, and the candles flew all about the place.
The blow you received came from Tucker?
Certainly, I was knocked down, and was on the ground two or three minutes, and beat while I was on the ground, but by whom it is impossible for me to say; I had a thick great coat on, which kept the blows off in some measure, but I received the first blow from Tucker; when I got up again Tucker was there; I lost my hat, I picked up my hat, and Tucker was standing in a posture rather of defence, as if he was going to fight, and after I got off, (there was one of the officers advised me to get off as fast as I could) and there was a mob near me, hurraying and huzzaying, and making a great noise.
Ask Mr. Griffiths if he did not strike me repeatedly before I touched him?
Not to my knowledge, I do not think I did.
I could bring a hundred people, if I had had habeas's, that would have sworn he struck me repeatedly.
Did you set down the box during any part of the time, so as you could strike him?
No.
He threw it down.
Did he strike you before you left your hold of the box?
He did; I am very sure of it; and I had not struck him at that time.
I was in the King's Bench prison on the 29th of December, and saw the manufactory of candles carried on, in a room No. 6, in No. 15, which was called Tucker's room; and in a room No. 7, in No. 2, which was occupied by one Fence; on the 30th I petitioned the Commissioners for their warrant, and Mr. Mahew desired me to go again; I went on the 31st to the room, which was described to me by the marshal; Mr. Whitehead went with me; Tucker was standing with his back to the door, eating his dinner; his wife and children were in the room likewise; I saw a vast quantity of candles finished on the stage; there was above a hundred weight and a half of finished candles on the rods, and I observed besides a tin mould for dipping in to make candles, and a kettle to melt tallow, with tallow in it; there was about thirty pounds weight of unmanufactured tallow, that we brought away; I made a memorandum at the time, (looks at it) thirty-two pounds of tallow, and twenty-nine pounds of candles; I left Whitehead in possession, and went and secured another place; when I returned there was a great mob of people below in the yard, and I met one of the officers with the kettle, and he gave it to me, and I carried it to the outside of the prison; when I returned, Tucker was working among some sticks and rubbish, looking for a bludgeon; for when I came down stairs again, he had a bludgeon in his hand, and was standing, swearing he would kill the first man, or words to that purpose, that brought any more of his property down stairs; there was no officer there then but myself; I was coming down stairs, and he seemed to be very resolute, his waistcoat was all loose, and his shirt neck open, and no hat on; I told him not to be in such a passion, for I must make the best defence I could; as there were an hundred people about the door, all armed; I put my hand in my pocket, and took out a pistol, and said I would fire at them, and could not tell which of them it would hit; a great many of them dispersed; Tucker remained, and took up a brickbat in one hand, having a bludgeon in the other: I did not pretend to go out of the place, being able to defend myself; one of the marshalmen came, and desired me to leave what things I had there, and make the best of my way out, for all the other officers were on the outside of the prison; I saw Griffiths all dirt, I did not see who struck him; one of the marshalmen protected me out; they were both very considerable manufactories; there was room to hold five hundred, and stages erected for hanging the rods.
I am an officer of excise; I was coming down stairs immediately after Griffiths, with a box of candles from Tucker's room, and I saw Griffiths attacked at the bottom of the stairs, by Tucker and a great crowd of people; I stood still on the stairs with my box of candles, and Tucker endeavoured to take the box away from Griffiths, who had a box of candles in his hands, in this manner (one at each end); I saw them strive which should have the box; and Griffiths not letting go the box, I saw Tucker strike him on the right side of his face; I never saw Griffiths strike Tucker at all; it was directly before me.
I merely did it for want; I have been a debtor for a small debt upwards of a twelvemonth, I having a wife and four small children, I sold and pawned my bed, and every thing; my wife was ailing, and my children in the small pox; my Lord I could not make half a hundred, what I did was merely through want, that my children should not perish through the sharp thorn of hunger; they cried for bread, and I had none to give them, and I was persuaded to do this to get a bit of bread; Mr. Whitehead and the Gentlemen knew my distress, and they gave my wife money.
