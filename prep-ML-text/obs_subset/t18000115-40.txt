I am the wife of Samuel Huguenin, a jeweller , in Holborn ; the prisoner came under pretence of coming from the mangler's, as a chairwoman; I gave her the things mentioned in the indictment, on Monday the 23d of December; I saw them again the next day; I am positive the prisoner is the same person; she delivered eight duplicates to me in the passage.
I have known the prisoner several years; I live in the Borough; I was coming over the water, to see if any of my mistresses wanted me to work on Christmas-day; I had called upon Mrs. Huguenin; she asked me to call at the mangler's, and desire her to send for some things; coming down Holborn, I met the prisoner; I told her where I was going, and she went with me to the mangler's, and heard what I said to her, and then we parted.
On the 24th of December, I was sent for to No. 61, in Holborn; I found upon her this pair of pockets.
These are my property, they are my own work.
I was rather in liquor.
