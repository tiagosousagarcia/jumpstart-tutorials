I live at No. 13, Bear-yard : On the 13th of April last, I lost a bed-tick; I did not see him take it, but I saw him running away with it.
How far was the prisoner from your house when you saw him?
Eighteen yards, for I have measured it since; I immediately stopped him; I suspected it to be my property; when I collared him, he let it fall into my hands.
What are you?
An upholsterer by trade, and I sell a few broker's goods; I had but this one tick by me, and I bound it myself; I know it by the blue and white check lace round it; he said, if I would be favourable to him he would inform who was the person that had robbed me before.
Did he not say somebody had given it to him?
No; he said it was his first offence.
I saw the prisoner stopped by my husband, with the property upon him.
I saw the prisoner with the bed-tick, and I saw Mr. Thorn lay hold of him.
