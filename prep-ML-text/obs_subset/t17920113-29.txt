I keep the Carpenters-arms, No. 9, James-street, Oxford-road ; I lost some pint pots.
I am servant to Mr. Venys; I was standing at my master's door, and I saw the prisoner take up the pots.
I was going out to help my fellow-servant; I know the pots were missing.
I frequently had a pint of beer in the evening at this door; I had had a pint, and had got the pint pot in my hand, and the boy took up three, and ran and called to his master, and said I had taken the pots, and the master ran after me.
