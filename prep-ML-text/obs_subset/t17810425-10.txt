I live in Wheeler-street, Spital-fields , with Mr. Hopkins, a dyer ; I received thirty pounds weight of Bologna silk from Messrs. Adams and Ridall in Bread-street; I weighed it carefully, because there was a suspicion, while the prisoner was in the house; seven ounces were missing; the prisoner was challenged, and searched, and seven ounces, exactly corresponding with the quantity missing, was found concealed in his breeches.
When the prisoner was detected, I saw this silk taken out of his breeches.
