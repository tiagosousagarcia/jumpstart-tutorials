I live at the Angel-inn, the back of St. Clement's : on the eleventh of this month, I suspected the prisoner, having missed a number of things before: the prisoner was my servant , and had lived with me not quite three months; I examined her box; she opened it herself; I found a number of articles, and amongst the rest, a towel; I examined her person afterwards, and found under her cap, a table spoon in her hair: I have got the table spoon, and kept it ever since.
I live at Mr. Watson's: the prisoner went out of our yard on the 11th of February, after she was searched by my mistress; she went down to a vine vaults to get some refreshment; and when she came out, she gave me this huswife; and the duplicates are in it; I carried them to the bar; she gave them to me to let her go about her business; I told her she had better come and settle with my mistress: my mistress took them.
Tapp brought the duplicates to me; and I carried them before Justice Bond; and he summoned the pawnbrokers, Hawkins and Sowerby.
I am a pawnbroker: on the 11th of December, a tea-spoon for fifteen-pence was pawned at my shop; (the tea-spoon produced) ; I am not sure the prisoner at the bar is the person.
Is that the duplicate you gave?
Yes.
I did not look at any of them.
I can swear they are the very duplicates I took out of the huswife.
I am a pawnbroker: on the 2d of December, a person came to me, and pledged a tea-spoon for eighteen-pence; I asked if it was her own property? she said, yes: I cannot take upon me to swear that the prisoner at the bar is the person.
Did you deliver that duplicate to the person who pawned the spoon?
Yes.
