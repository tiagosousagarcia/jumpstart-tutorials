I live at the prosecutor's: I was in a back parlour: there is a glass in the door: I saw the prisoner in the shop: I did not see him come in: ours is an open shop: nobody was with him: I saw him take a new knife-case, and put it under his arm: he took it from a butler's tray that stood on a mahogany table: they were for sale: he walked out of the shop: I followed him: and about five doors from our shop, I called out, stop that boy : he walked away: and I saw him put down the knife-case in the street, on my calling out: I took it up, and returned into the shop: the boy turned down an alley in Berwick-street; and he was brought back to our shop in three minutes: it was not five minutes in the whole: (the knife-case deposed to): the boy denied taking it.
I know nothing about it.
