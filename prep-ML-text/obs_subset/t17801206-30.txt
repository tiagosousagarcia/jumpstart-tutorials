I keep the Red Hart in Shoe-lane . I saw the prisoner in my tap-room but I did not suspect her; I was sent for a quarter of an hour after to Mr. Scandaret's where I saw a half gallon pot of mine.
I was sent for to take the prisoner into custody; I found several pots under her petticoats; one is an half gallon pot. (It was produced in court and deposed to by the prosecutor.)
I found them in the street.
