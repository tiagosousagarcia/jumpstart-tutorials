I keep a public-house in New-street, Fetter-lane: The prisoner came to my house on the 21st of November, between six and seven o'clock in the evening, and called for a pennyworth of twopenny; he gave me a sixpence to change, it being candle-light I did not observe it was a bad one, though I had some little suspicion of it, I gave him five pennyworth of halfpence in change; about a quarter of an hour afterwards he came again, and ordered a pint of beer, for the payment of which he offered me another sixpence, and I suspected it; I rubbed it on the hearth stone of the tap-room, and saw it was copper; I then pulled out the other sixpence that I had taken of him, I rubbed that, and found that was copper; I told him I must take my porter back again, and he must give me my change; he was looking over the halfpence to give me them back, and I observed another sixpence in his hand; I desired him to give me that, which, when I looked at it, I saw was a bad one also; I then sent my brother for an officer, and had him taken into custody.
On the 21st of November, I was sent for to apprehend the prisoner; I searched him, and found seven bad sixpences upon him, and about three shillingsworth of good halfpence.
I got them in change for a seven-shilling piece.
