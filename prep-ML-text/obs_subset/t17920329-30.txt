I am servant to one Squire Thistleworth. I knew the prisoner last year at Brighton and at Richmond. The prisoner was out of place, and he came to beg a bit of victuals; and I left my watch with my fellow servant to get myself ready; the watch was sold to another person; I never saw it in the custody of the prisoner.
The prisoner came last Saturday was a week, about nine o'clock, to my shop, No. 11, Cockspur-street, and offered this watch; I was called, and refused to buy it; he cried, and said it was all he had left, he been indiscreet enough to lose all his money by insurance, and wanted to go to his friends; I bought it of him, and gave him a guinea and a half for it; that was the full value; I am certain I bought it of the prisoner.
I was fellow servant with the prosecutor; he delivered it into my hands to get my master's horses ready; I put it into my pocket, and at twelve I put it into a cupboard in the stable, and about six I went to dinner, and returned about seven; the watch was in the cupboard; then I let in the prisoner, and gave him some victuals; he staid in the stable with me a good while, and went away, and in five minutes after I missed the watch; no other person was there during the time, till after the watch was missing.
I have nobody to my character in the world.
Court to prisoner. Where do you come from?
Out of Hertfordshire.
If any mercy is shewn you I hope you will be grateful in future, and behave like a good member of society.
