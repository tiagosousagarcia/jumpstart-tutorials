On Saturday night I brought the bits down, and put them in a closet, and on Monday morning they were gone.
On the Monday there were six bits and six snaffles brought to me, and I told the man there should be seven of each.
I am a constable; the prisoner told me if Mr. Middlemore would let him go into the Army of Reserve, he would acknowledge the whole. (Produces a snaffle-bit.)
On the 29th of November the prisoner offered this bit for sale in Bond-street; he said he found it in Holborn; we would not buy it, because it had the owner's name upon it; we gave him one shilling for finding it, and would not part with the bit.
The prisoner was a townsman of mine, and being in distress I used to relieve him; he was at my house on Sunday the 27th of November.
Mr. Middlemore has been in the habit of\\ send\\ ing me round with things for sale.
(To the Prosecutor.) Did you send him round with this bit?
No.
