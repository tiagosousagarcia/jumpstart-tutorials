I work with Mr. Thomas, a back-maker : I put my saw in a cupboard in Mr. Thomas's shop on Saturday the 9th of July, and missed it on the 11th.
I apprehended the prisoner on Sunday the 10th of July, I saw him in the fields lousing himself, with two saws by him; I asked him how he came by them; he said they were his.
I went to lay down on the grass, and the saws were there.
