He has been a customer of your's for many years?
Yes.
I am a plumber and glazier, at Staines: On the 5th of December, the prisoner brought some pots to my house, I was about twenty yards from home when I saw him come out of my shop; in about five minutes afterwards he came to the shop again; he came in, and I said, what have you been doing now, you have been stealing these pewter pots, there were four of them; I sent for Buckmaster and Parrott, and the prisoner said to Buckmaster, if he would forgive him this time, he would not steal any more; he said it was the first time he ever did.
He is above seventy years of age, is he not?
Yes.
And he has been in prison ever since the 6th of December?
Yes.
This is my pot.
I found the pots.
