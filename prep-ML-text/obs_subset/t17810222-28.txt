I am a tailor ; I live in Kirby-street, Hatton-garden. On the 15th of December the Prisoner, who was a servant to an hair-dresser , came to shave and dress a gentleman who lodges with me. He came again the next morning, and when he was gone the things mentioned in the indictment were missing.
I lost three spoons of my own, and one of Mrs. Allen's; I know nothing of the stealing of them.
I am servant to Mrs. Malkin. The prisoner came on the 15th to the lodger; he came again on the 16th at a quarter after seven o'clock; I let him in. He said the gentleman ordered him to come at that time. I made the water for him. I said it was hot. He put his fingers in and said it was not hot enough. He put it down again on the trivet and said, by the time I had been up stairs to call the gentleman, it would be hot enough. I went up stairs and came down again immediately. I found the water thrown down in the passage and the street-door open. The spoons were taken off a shelf in the kitchen. At eight o'clock the other hair-dresser came, who I thought was gone away, which surprised me.
I am a barber. The prisoner came to me on the 15th of December. I sent him to dress the gentleman at Mr. Malkin's; he ran away on the 15th after dinner, and I saw no more of him. He was not sent by me on the 16th. A person on the 15th came into the shop who said he knew the prisoner, that he was just come from ballast-heaving. The prisoner ran away directly.
I never went there on the 16th. I burnt my arm on the 15th.
