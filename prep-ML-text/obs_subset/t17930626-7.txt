I live with James Maddocks and Joseph Gibson ; I am first cousin to both; they lost on the 12th of June, four wainscot boards and three deal boards out of the yard; I saw the prisoner come in the morning, he had been backwards and forwards for upwards of a week, loitering about the yard, and never bought any thing; so I watched him, he had been used to buy, but not at that time; I saw him look these deals out, and hide them behind the counting house; he saw me in the yard and Mr. Maddocks, and he went away again; about twelve or one he came in again; I went down the yard and told a sawyer to look out after him; the sawyer gave me intelligence that he was gone; I followed him, and took him with the deals on his shoulder; the constable has the deals; I took particular notice of the deals when he left them behind the Counting house, and five minutes before the deals were there, and when I took him they were gone.
I saw the prisoner carry the deals out of the yard.
I am the constable. Mr. Maddocks stopped him with the deals, and fetched me, and gave me charge of him and the deals; I have kept the deals ever since.
With respect to the thing, I do declare that I did not know any thing of the kind till that young man came to me; I have dealt in the yard sixteen or seventeen years, in the course of that time I have laid out some hundreds of pounds; I knew no more about when he challenged me with the property, no more then you; he came to me, and said you have not settled for that; I said I have; I had been drinking; I know no more of the business than the stones I was walking upon; that young man knows that I have dealt with honesty and integrity; if I had not been as a person out of my senses I should not have attempted any thing in that yard, without expecting to have been found out.
The prisoner got up a wainscot pearch to watch me while I was gone out; he did not appear in liquor at all.
