I live in the parish of Hendon ; I am a sugar-ware potter : On Saturday, the 30th of July, I lost a waistcoat; I know nothing of it myself.
I am brother to the prosecutor: I took the prisoner about a mile from our house, with the waistcoat under his jacket; there were three others walking with him; I took it from him, and secured him; I had seen the waistcoat hanging upon the hedge to dry that day.
I work for Mr. Morris: I saw the waistcoat under the prisoner's jacket as I was going from dinner; I immediately went to the house, and saw Mr. Joseph Morris , and he and I followed him, and took him.
