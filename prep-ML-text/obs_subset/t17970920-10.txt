I had this from Mr. Shelton, I saw him sign it; (it is read) ; I was present when he was tried, I know him to be the person; I delivered him at Woolwich, in the November following.
- I am an officer belonging to Bow-street: I apprehended the prisoner on the 4th of this month, upon suspicion of returning from transportation, from an information that I received; I apprehended him in Parliament-street ; he was walking along with another man that I did not know.
- The prisoner was delivered on board the Prudentia, at Woolwich, on the 21st of November, 1796, and escaped while at work in the Dock-yard, on the 4th of July, 1797.
Are you sure he is the man?
I have no doubt of it.
I leave it to the mercy of the Court.
