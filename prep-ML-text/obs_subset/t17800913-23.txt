I am in partnership with Evan Evans . I packed up the things mentioned in the indictment (repeating them) on the 16th of July, and sent them by our porter, Henry Carefield , to the Red Lion, in Cockspur-street, Charing-cross , to go to Gosport.
I am a constable. I found these things ( producing the goods mentioned in the indictment) under a bed in the house of Mary Spencer , on the 17th of July.
I am porter to Messrs. Passman and Evans; I saw this parcel packed up; I took it to the inn; it was late; a man there said he would take me to the book-keeper of the inn; he took me to a publick-house; the prisoner was there. He said he was the book-keeper; he took me to a publick-house a little above the inn. I delivered the parcel to him and he delivered it to the other man who went away. I gave him sixpence and he gave me change, taking two pence for booking. I insisted upon seeing it booked; he took me to the publick-house and asked me to sit down. I said it was not customary for the book-keeper to ask one to sit down. He said he would book them in Grace-church-street; for, he said, the same coach which went from the Red Lion went from thence, and the books were there. He then said the goods were gone to Tower-street to his house; the prisoner wanted to go to Tower-street. Finding him shuffling I charged the watch with him; the goods were afterwards found at his companion's in Tower-street by the prisoner's directions.
