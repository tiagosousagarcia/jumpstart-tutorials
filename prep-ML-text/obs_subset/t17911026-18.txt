The prisoner was our servant , or chairwoman.
I am wife of the prosecutor, I did not know when the prisoner took the spoon, but it was pledged the 1st of October; I did not miss it till the 13th of October.
I lent her 4 s. upon it, I had no suspicion of her, I have seen her before, she said she brought it for her mistress.
I did it through necessity.
