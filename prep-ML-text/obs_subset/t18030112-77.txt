- I take in mangling , and lodge in Holford-court, Fenchurch-street ; the prisoner came in, and asked me for her things, on the 1st of January, and pointed to one gown, and then to another, saying, they were her things, and she took them away; I wanted her to stop till my wife came home, but she would not.
I am an officer belonging to the Poultry Compter, the prisoner was brought to the Compter, and said she had left a guinea on the table to pay for a leg of mutton: I went to look for it, with her in custody; she took me into Shoreditch, and said she was going to take the two gowns to Norwich with her, but wished me to take them, and let her go. (The gowns produced, and identified).
I have nothing to say; my father and mother were killed by a house falling on them in Baker's-row, Whitechapel, and I have not a friend in the world. GUILTY , aged 49.
