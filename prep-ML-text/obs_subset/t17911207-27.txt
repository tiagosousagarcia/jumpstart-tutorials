I am a chairman . I lost a chair-cushion on the 8th of November, from the King's Head, Albemarle-street ; I heard my chair move, and went out, and saw the prisoner run away with this cushion under his arm; I pursued him, and called stop thief! the watchman got hold of him; he never was out of my sight, nor was he ever ten yards from me. (Produces the cushion and deposes to it.) The prisoner threw the cushion away; I am certain he is the man.
I leave myself to the mercy of the Court.
