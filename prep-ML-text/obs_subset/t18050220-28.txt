I am an Officer of Marlborough-street; I met the prisoner in Conduit-street, and found this pot in her pocket, and the other folded up in a cloth inside of her apron; the name of Ann Grocer is on the pots.
My mother keeps a public-house , they both belong to my mother, I assist her in the business.
What is the value of them?
Three shillings; I know nothing of the prisoner.
Where is your mother's house?
In Park-street, Grosvenor-square , about half a mile from Conduit-street.
When you met her, which way was she going?
She was going away from Park-street.
