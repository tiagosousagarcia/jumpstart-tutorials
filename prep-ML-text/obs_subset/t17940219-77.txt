Where did you use to keep her?
In the yard.
You know that pigs are not to be kept in London?
Upon my word mine is a very large yard.
Has she the liberty of the whole yard?
She has.
Then she may take a walk into Smithfield if she pleases?
She may.
This was seven o'clock in the evening?
It was.
Was she locked up?
No.
Not was your yard locked?
No. He was driving it down Chick lane, and not to the Green-yard.
About seven o'clock I went out and heard the pig cry, and I went out thinking it was some of ours; my master keeps some; I ran up to Smithfield, and that man then had the string to the leg of the pig, and Mr. Goodall took it into his hand and took it home; he was going the wrong way to the Green-yard; then Mr. Goodall directly lays hold of him, and sends for an officer and charged him.
I know no more than taking the charge Friday night seven o'clock, he said he found it running along the street, and he was going to take it to the Green-yard.
