I live at No. 6, Clark's-court, Bishopsgate Within; on the 13th of July the bundle was taken from me between nine and ten at night; Samuel Bishop came up first, (there was two others) he said, let us ride, I was behind a gentleman's coach; then another came up and struck me on the fore-finger on my left hand; I took his stick from him; Bishop took my bundle and run away; I ran after him I thought they were after no good; I run after him in Field-lane; I never lost sight of him till he was taken by M'Guffin.
The last witness came to my house about nine o'clock, I gave him the bundle to take to his mother to get washed.
I am a soldier; the child cried stop thief, I called to him, he dropped the bundle; I took him to the watch-house, with many of the neighbours.
I am a warder of St. Andrew's, Holborn, I was setting the patrol; I searched the prisoner, the bundle was brought, which I gave to the officer of the night, Mr. Twitchell.
I got this bundle at the watch-house.
I heard the cry of stop thief, I was coming down Holborn; I run, and in running along I picked up this piece of new cloth, which the constable produces.
