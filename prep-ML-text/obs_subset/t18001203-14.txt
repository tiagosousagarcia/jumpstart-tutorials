- I am the wife of John Field ; I keep the Marquis of Granby, Castle-street, Oxford-market; the prisoner was taken, with my pots, in the street.
- On the 5th of November, in the afternoon, I saw the prisoner come down Winslow-street, and take the pots from the top of a rail at Mrs. Williams's, No. 2, in Winslow-street , she put them in her apron; I crossed over from my master's warehouse-door, and told her she had not got her own property; I then took her to the Marquis of Granby, and delivered the pots to Mrs. Field; her servant had hung them upon the rail. (The property was deposed to by Mrs. Field).
I acknowledge I took them, but I did not mean to take them. GUILTY , aged 48.
