I am a silk mercer . On the 29th of January I was informed by a person, that a woman had taken a piece of flannel from my door, immediately I ran out of the house, and ran after the woman.
Who was the woman you ran after?
The prisoner at the bar, I ran after her, and took her, and took the flannel from under her long scarlet cloak myself, and had her committed, from the office in Great Marlborough-street.
Whose flannel was it?
My own flannel, there is my own shop mark on it, it is twenty-eight yards.
You are sure you had not sold that piece with the marks on?
I am sure I had not.
How long before had you seen it?
I had seen it a few days before.
Have you kept it ever since?
Yes.
Produce it. What is the mark on the flannel?
S. C.
I live with Mr. Bennett. On the 29th of January, Thursday or Friday, I put this flannel out at the door, as we usually do, in the morning about ten or eleven o'clock.
Did you see the woman take it?
No.
What time did you miss it at the door?
About four or five o'clock.
Did you see it on the woman?
Yes.
Where is your master's house?
No. 100, Oxford-street; I was informed that it was gone, and I ran out after the woman, and see the prisoner at the bar turn round with this piece of flannel under her cloak; at that time my master came up and took it from her.
Has your master kept it ever since?
Yes.
Is that your master's property?
Yes.
I did not take it, it was the two boys that took it, and I was taking it from them, and they ran into the shop, and told them that I was taking of it.
