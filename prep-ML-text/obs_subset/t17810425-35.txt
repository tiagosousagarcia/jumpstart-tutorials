I lost a side of bacon, on the 14th of March, out of the stove where we dry bacon; the prisoner served his time with me, and he worked for me at this time.
Between five and six o'clock on Wednesday the 14th of March, I saw the prisoner come out of Mr. Innover's gate with a side of bacon on his shoulder; he carried it to the Two Brewers alehouse; he came back, and went in at the gate again; I told Mr. Innover of it the next morning; I did not think of telling of it till I had spoke to my husband about it, who worked for Mr. Innover; the bacon was never found; the publican said before the justice, that he never saw the bacon.
