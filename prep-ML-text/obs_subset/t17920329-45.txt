I am wife of William Adderley ; he is at sea. I live in North-east-passage, Wellclose-square . On the 25th of February my house was broke open; I went out at eight; I locked the door, and left nobody; I came back about nine; I found the door broke open; the staple was wrenched double; I lost the things in the indictment; there are two rooms to the house, but only one door: I never got any thing again but the shift and the ribbon; I never saw the prisoner before he was taken.
I produce a shift and some ribbon; the shift was taken out from his trowsers wet, by Mumford, and I was present; and the ribbon I found in his pocket: it was about ten or half after, the same night, I was going into the publick-house next door, and ran against two men; one was the prisoner; he spoke to me; that was about eight; and when I heard of the robbery I suspected the prisoner, and went after him, and took him in Gravel-lane; the passage led to her court.
Will you ask the prosecutrix how she gets her living; she is a common prostitute, and will swear any body's life away for the reward.
I did not know there was any reward given. I get my living in Rosemary-lane.
Court to West. Is that true?
She deals in Rosemary-lane in old clothes.
Is she a woman of character enough to believe?
I know nothing against her character for dishonesty; she is a very slight acquaintance of mine.
