My husband is a carpenter : I lost these gowns off the horse by the fire-place; I saw the prisoner take them: I live at No. 1, Chapel-street, Tottenham-court-road : the parlour where they were stolen from, was on the ground floor; it was on the 29th of January, Friday, about seven in the evening; he took them with a stick; he opened the parlour door; I thought it was my husband; and in a moment he dragged the things off the horse; I ran immediately after him; when he found I was so close, he took the things and threw them down a cellar; I saw him stopped; he said to me, he was only walking past the door: the things were picked up by Mrs. Saunders, and given to me: I gave them to the constable, Whiteway.
How soon did you see them after the man was stopped?
Immediately.
Did you pick up the gowns?
Yes.
Who claimed them?
Mrs. Davidson; I gave them to her.
I am a constable: Mrs. Davidson gave me these gowns.
