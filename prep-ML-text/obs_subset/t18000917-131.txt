I live in Denmark-Street, St. George's : I was not at home when I lost my things; the prisoner lodged in my room two nights; on the 4th of August I went out, and when; returned, the prisoner and the property was gone.
I am a broker, at No. 27, New Road, St. George's in the East: On the 4th of August the prisoner came to me, and wanted me to purchase a bed, and a pillow; she took me to a room in Denmark-Street, and I bought them; the next morning Mrs. Grotage came to me, and I shewed her the things that I had bought of the prisoner. (The property was produced, and deposed to by Mrs. Grotage).
I am a constable: I took the prisoner, she was very much in liquor.
I went to fetch the bed, and paid half-a-guinea for it; that is all that I know.
Have you a husband?
No; my husband has been dead these eight years, he died in Well-Street.
Is there any truth in this story of men being introduced to her?
I was not at home from Sunday morning till Monday evening.
Mrs. Grotage's own account was, that she went out on purpose for her to have her sweethearts there, that she might get her some money.
