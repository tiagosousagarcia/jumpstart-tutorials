I keep an umbrella shop in Oxford street . On the 26th of May about ten in the morning, the prisoner at the bar came into my shop to look at some parasols; I opened one to shew her, I went away, and left my wife to shew her the remainder.
Did she purchase the one you shewed her.
She did not; when I was down stairs I heard a noise, I came up stairs, my lad was gone after her, my wife accused her of taking away something that did not belong to her; when she was brought back I sent for Mr. Littlewood, she was searched, and these gold keys were found upon her; my wife had taken the parasol from her before.
Is your wife here.
No.
