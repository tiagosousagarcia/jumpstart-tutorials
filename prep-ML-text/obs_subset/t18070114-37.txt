I live at No. 108, Tottenham court road , I am a linen draper .
In consequence of any information did you go after the prisoner.
I did. I saw her going out of the shop, I overtook her about thirty yards from the house, she had a long Bath cloak on; I told her that she had taken something out of the shop, she said that she had nothing; I pulled the cloak open, I saw nothing, and shaking her petticoats, she dropped eleven handkerchiefs from between her legs. I took the handkerchiefs up, and took her to the watchhouse; I gave charge of her, and I left the handkerchiefs in the custody of the watchhouse keeper.
I was going down Tottenham court road; a woman in a cloak dropped these articles. I picked them up and put them in my pocket.
