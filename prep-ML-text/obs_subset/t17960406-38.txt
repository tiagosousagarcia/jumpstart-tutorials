I live in Clement's Inn, with Mr. Sharman: On the 16th of March, I went with Mary Bailey to her lodgings, and she asked me to stay all night; I did, and in the morning she went away with my cloaths.
You slept with her?
Yes; I awoke a little after six, and the prisoner was gone.
Were you in liquor the night before?
Yes.
Did you ever get any of your things again?
The pawnbroker has them.
I took these things in of a woman; I can't tell who it was.
Was it the prisoner?
I cannot swear to to the person.
What time did you take them in?
On the 16th of March; she said they were her husband's; she was quite in a different dress to what she is now.
I was constable of the night, in St. Giles's watch-house; the prisoner was brought by the prosecutor and watchman; he charged her with robbing him of his cloaths a night or two before; she said, the gentleman promised if she delivered the cloaths back, he would not hurt her; she delivered me a pocket-book, containing a duplicate of the waistcoat and breeches and a handkerchief.
What day was this?
The 16th of March.
Look at that duplicate, Do you know it?
Yes; it is my writing.
The prisoner told me she had sold two keys at an old iron shop, and told me where; I went and found it, it was delivered to Gregory, who keeps the shop, by order of the Magistrate.
I am owner of the shop; I bought this key (producing it,) of the prisoner, on the 17th of March.
This is the key of Mr. Sharman's chambers, which was in my pocket, and these are my cloaths.
He came into my room, and said, he had been robbed of a guinea and a half by another woman; he asked me to let him stay all night, and he would let me pawn his things; he gave me one half-guinea, and said, it would be no object in the morning.
