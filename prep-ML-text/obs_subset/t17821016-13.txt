I am foreman to Mr. Rust, Shoemaker , in Butcher-Row, Temple-Bar ; on Tuesday the 8th of October, between four and five in the afternoon the prisoner came along the Row, I observed her standing on the step of the door; the boots were hanging one on one side of the shop door, and the other on the other, she looked at them, and took one off, and turned herself about, looked at the other, took that off, put them together, and put them under her cloak, turned off the step and run away; I immediately followed her, she turned up the court close to the house, she went rather sharpish; I said good woman let me have those boots, they are none of your property; says she, Sir, they are none of yours, the gentleman bought them and paid for them, and gave them to me; says I, do you walk back with me, and I will tell you another story, I took the boots from her and brought her back to the shop.
Whereabouts in the shop was you when she took them?
There are two windows to the shop, I was cutting out work for the workmen, and I saw her take the boots, she could not see me; I never saw her before; I sent for Mr. Rust, and he sent for a constable who took her to Bow-street, and she was committed.
You are very sure she is the woman that took them?
Yes Sir.
I never took the boots, nor I never saw the man in my life; I was going along the Court, and there was a woman standing there, and just as I turned up these boots lay, some gentleman came up and said, what do you do with the boots; I would not have the assurance to do any such thing; I was ashamed of my situation, and let nobody know.
