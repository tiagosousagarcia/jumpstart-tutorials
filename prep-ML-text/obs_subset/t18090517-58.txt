I am clerk to William Gilpin ; he is an army agent and clothier ; the prisoner was a cutter. On Monday, the 8th of May, upon the foreman giving me information; I desired the prisoner to be brought down from the room he was employed into the room below; I was told he had some property about him that did not belong to him; he denied having any thing; I requested him to unbutton himself, and then he told me he had got a piece of white cloth which he pulled from under his shirt; he said he had taken it for the purpose of giving it to an orphan child, it was the first time he had done so, and he hoped we would let him go; this is the piece of cloth, I have kept it ever since. I have no doubt but it is my master's.
I only beg the lenity of the court, I have a large family, and I am an old man.
