- My husband is a gentleman's servant ; the prisoner was my servant ; I am in the milk business; she came to me on Sunday, the 13th of August, and I discharged her, upon hearing a bad character of her, on Tuesday, the 15th; I obtained a warrant from Marlborough-street, and apprehended her on suspicion; I learnt that she was gone to live at Camden-Town; the officer brought her down to my apartments, and searched her, when two of the spoons dropped from her, and the duplicate of the other was found upon her.
- I belong to Marlborough-street office; I apprehended the prisoner at Camden-Town; she made many excuses, but I told her she must go with me; as I was taking her down Titchfield-street, she told me the spoons were did in the house; I took her back to the house, and the moment I entered the room, I saw her put her hand in her right hand pocket; I told her I would search her myself, and she dropped the spoons under her apron; I picked them up, and she said, that either me or the prosecutrix dropped them ourselves; I searched her pocket, and found this duplicate of a tea-spoon, (produces it) ; I took her to Marlborough-street, and then I went to the pawnbroker at Hamp-street, and got the spoon.
- I am a pawnbroker; the prisoner pawned three spoons with me, on the 16th, I am sure she is the woman; on the 28th, she fetched two spoons out, and left the other one; she pledged them in the name of Courtney.
That is my husband's name.
