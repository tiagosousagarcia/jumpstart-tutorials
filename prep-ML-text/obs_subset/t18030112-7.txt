I live at Clare in Suffolk; I am proprietor of a stage-waggon to the Three Nuns-inn, Aldgate; I am answerable for all the property in the waggon. I can only prove the property.
I am a butcher: On Christmas-eve last, I saw the prisoner take a bundle of cloths out of the apron of the Clare-waggon, opposite the Three Nuns-inn, Aldgate ; he carried them away under his arm; I went after him, and took him; I never lost sight of him, I brought him back with the burdle under his arm. I delivered them to the waggoner, George Jarvis, and he claimed them.
I am a waggoner: The last witness brought the two cloths and the prisoner to me on Christmas-eve; the prisoner had the two packing-cloths under his arm; I had seen them about four hours before; they are marked with red ochre.
I picked up these cloths under the shafts of the waggon.
