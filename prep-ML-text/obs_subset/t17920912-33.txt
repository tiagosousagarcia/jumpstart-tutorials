I live at No. 76, Charlotte Street , the 20th of August I let the prisoner a single room, at half a crown a week, three pair of stairs; he slept there that night; he went away a quarter before nine on the 21st; I saw him again the same day at twelve with a gentleman he lived with, in Devonshire-street; I went up into the room about a quarter after ten; I missed the sheets; I took him into custody; I saw my sheets the same afternoon at the magistrates, about four in the afternoon; I am sure they are the sheets he slept in that night.
I am the constable; I had the sheets before the magistrate.
I am a pawnbroker; I believe these are the sheets I took in from one Mary Potts in the name of Elizabeth Harrington , who she said was her mistress.
I lived with Elizabeth Harrington at the time my mistress gave them to me to pledge.
came to me before I was up, and he brought those sheets in his pocket, and asked me to let my servant take them, and I said I did not care, if they were his own; I have known him several years, but never knew where he lodged.
What way of life are you in?
I am an unfortunate woman, my lord.
