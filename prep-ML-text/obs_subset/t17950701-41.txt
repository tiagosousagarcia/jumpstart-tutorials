I am shopman to Mr. Thomas Clarke , linen draper , the corner of Drury-lane, in Holborn . On Tuesday, the 26th of May, some lads came into the shop, and informed me that there were two or three men at the window attempting to steal some goods: in consequence of which I went out at the Holborn door, and went into St. Giless' property speaking, and went to an opposite neighbour's, went into the shop, where I looked through the window, and see the prisoner at the bar and another person standing; the prisoner at the bar was then endeavouring to pull down these shawls; they hung upon some blind irons; the other person that was with him seemed to be looking about and sometimes talking to him; he pulled at them repeatedly, there were many people looking at the goods, standing at the door; at last he pulled them off the iron which they hung upon, and herolled them up together, and put them up underneath his coat. As soon as I see him do that I came out from where I was standing; he was then just going to run away down Drury-lane, and before he entered into Drury-lane I caught him in my arms with these shawls underneath his coat.
I have got nothing at all to say.
