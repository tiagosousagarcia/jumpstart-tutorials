I am a cheesemonger , No. 13, Cock-hill, Ratcliff ; the prisoner at the bar stopped at my window on the 14th of February, and took from thence two pieces of pork, I saw him do it; I followed him, and took the pieces of pork from him, and took him to Shadwell Office.
Do you know any thing of the man?
I was informed at the Office that he had been detected of a similar offence before.
It is real necessity and want.
