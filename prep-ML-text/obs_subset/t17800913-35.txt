I am cook at the Bull-Inn, Bishopgate-street . On Friday night, the 1st of September, between eleven and twelve at night, the prisoner came in for a bed; I went to call the chamber-maid, and when I returned I missed my handkerchief off the kitchen-dresser; the prisoner was gone out again, and got half-way up the gateway. I followed him, and called out, Stop him! and he was brought back into the kitchen; my handkerchief was found on the second step of the stairs, in the yard, where he was to go up to bed; he was brought back by those stairs my young mistress was in the kitchen, and saw him take it.
I was in the kitchen, the prisoner came in and asked for a bed; the cook-maid went to call the chambermaid; I saw the prisoner take the handkerchief off the dresser, and go out; I called after him; the cook came immediately, and followed him, and he was brought back; he acknowledged taking the handkerchief, and said he was in liquor.
I went to the Bull-Inn for a bed; I did not go into the kitchen, only within the gates; the young woman went to call the chambermaid; then they called after me, and said I had stolen something; they searched me; I had nothing upon me.
