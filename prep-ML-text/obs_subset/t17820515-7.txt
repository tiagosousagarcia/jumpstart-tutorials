On Friday last I was at the Two Blue Posts in Old Bond-street , in company with the prisoner; we drank four pots of porter, and staid there three hours. I had a bag, containing three guineas and five shillings. The prisoner is my tenant. I took my canvas bag out, and paid the reckoning; then I fell asleep, and slept for an hour; we sat in a box opposite one another; there was no other person in the box: when I awaked, I got a coach, and rode home: when I went to pay the coachman, I missed my bag and money. I had the prisoner taken before a justice; there he acknowledged that he took my money, but he said he took it off the bench.
I am the prosecutor's daughter. I changed a half-guinea for my father.
I am a constable. I searched the prisoner; I observed him put his hand into his breeches-pocket, take out a shilling, and tuck it into the waistband of his breeches. This is the shilling (producing it)
This is the shilling I gave my father in change.
I did not take the money.
