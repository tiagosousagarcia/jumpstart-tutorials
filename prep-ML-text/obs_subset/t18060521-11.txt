What is the prisoner.
He came from Dyot-street, I came up after he was taken, I saw him in custody, I heard his confession.
I work for the Marquis of Abercorn, as a labourer; on Thursday the 15th of May, as I was going to my brother, I met the prisoner with a large quantity of clothes under his arm, there was a boy coming from his poultry yard, I sent him back to enquire if they had lost any clothes from the laundry, I keep him till he was put into the constable's hands, I delivered the clothes to the constable.
(to Woodhouse) Had you any conversation with the prisoner.
Yes, I really think he is not right in his intellects.
You speak from the impression of your mind.
Yes, he did not appear to be in his senses.
