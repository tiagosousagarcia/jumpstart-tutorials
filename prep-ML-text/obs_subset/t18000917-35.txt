I am a marine Police-officer: On Saturday the 9th of August, in the afternoon, I saw some sugar running out of a hogshead into a man's apron, upon Botolph-wharf's ; another officer told me the prisoner was the man and assisted me in taking him into custody.
Who does the sugar belong to?
I do not know.
I am a constable: On the 9th of August I was upon duty on the quays; I say the prisoner and several more suspicious persons about the quays; I watched the prisoner, I saw him and another put their backs against the warehouse, and their feet against the hogshead of sugar, and shove it in with their feet; I saw them haul the cross-bar, which secures the head of the hogshead, away, I cannot say which of them it was; I then saw the prisoner step on one side for a few seconds, and he then brought an apron and spread it down by the hogshead, and began to scrape the sugar out with his left-hand as he leaned over the hogshead, to prevent any body seeing what he was about; I then thought proper to take him into custody; when I was coming towards him, he had quitted the hogshead and was coming towards me, I laid hold of him, and he attempted to rescue himself from me, by which means I tore his shirt and smock frock, which he had on at the time; I then took him into the warehouse, tied his hands, and took him to the Compter; I desired Davey to take the apron up, which he did, and came to my assistance.
Do you know whose sugar it was?
No.
It could not be easily ascertained, I suppose?
No; there were a number of hogsheads about at the same time.
I was going along Freshwharf, and the officer laid hold of me, tied my hands and took me to the Compter, they searched me, but I had no sugar upon me.
