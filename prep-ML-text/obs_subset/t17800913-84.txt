I live at Shadwell-market . On the 9th of this month, I lost the things mentioned in the indictment (repeating them) I was sent for to Denmark-street to look after a gentlewoman's house; I put up these things in a bundle, and laid them on a table; the prisoner and two other soldier s came in, and called for a pint of beer; I left the bundle on the top of a settee bed, and went up stairs for a handkerchief; when I returned, the bundle and the soldiers were gone; this was about half after eleven o'clock; I went home, and going up King David-lane, I saw them in a publick-house; I went and got assistance, and took them up, and about an hour after the prisoner brought the things to me from the Bee-hive in Penitent-street; I asked him where the things were? He said, would I hurt him, if he told me where the things were? I said no, I did not want to hurt him, and he went with the man from the justice's, and brought the things.
