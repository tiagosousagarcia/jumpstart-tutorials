I am a butcher in Neport-market ; I was down in my cellar, killing; and a person came by in the dusk of the evening, and bawls out, does any body belong to the sheep? here is a sheep laying at a distance, and here is a hook missing! I came up immediately and missed a sheep; I pursued after it, and overtook the prisoner with the sheep, and he chucked the sheep off his shoulder; I called him by his name; I knew him; he lived within a door of me, for a quarter of a year; I took him to the office; he said another man took it off the hook, and gave him to carry.
I never said so, I deny having the sheep.
