I live at No. 10, Burr-street Manchester-square ; I keep a piece-broker's shop for taylors ; the woman came into my shop.
Had she a child with her
No. When the prisoner came into my shop I happened to be very busy; she got down to the bottom of the counter; Richard Thompson stopped her with the pieces of cassimere.
On a Wednesday in May, I cannot recollect the day of the month, I was in Mrs. Ayscough's shop, I saw the prisoner with her arm laid over a bundle of pieces; she had her apron over both her arms; I saw her draw the pieces out of the bundle and put them in her pocket; I looked at her, and then took her by the arm, I said are you not ashamed to rob such an old woman as Mrs. Ayscough. Mrs. Ayscough was not then looking that way, she was serving somebody else in the shop; Mrs. Ayscough came round the counter and sent for a constable; her pocket was took off, and part of the cassimere was found on her; I saw her throw the rest on the floor.
I am a constable. Mrs. Ayscough gave me charge of this woman. One of her pockets was delivered to me, it was in another man's hand when I came in the shop, it had these pieces in it; I have had them in my custody ever since.
I saw them lay; I was in great distress; I picked up a bit of blue, and they brought what they pleased to me.
