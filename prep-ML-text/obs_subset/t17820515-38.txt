My mother ( Ann Taylor ) and I keep a chandler's shop , in Monmouth-street, St. Giles's . On the 22d of April, at night, I went down into the cellar; I saw the prisoner walking backwards and forwards before the door; I had some suspicion of him, and watched him; he went into the shop; I came up out of the cellar, and met him coming out with the till; upon seeing me, he put it down on the compter; it contained the money mentioned in the indictment; I counted it after I had taken him.
Are you sure it was the prisoner?
He had a black coat on, and his hair tied behind; I don't know the prisoner is the man now.
What did you do with him?
I took him before the justice.
Is the prisoner the man you took before the justice?
I believe he is; but I cannot swear to him.
