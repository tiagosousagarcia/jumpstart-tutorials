- I am the wife of Edward Harnett, at the Baker's-arms, Whitecross-street : I missed a sheet on the 28th of August, from a bed in the three pair of stairs back room; the prisoner lodged in the two pair back room, her husband and two children lodged with her, she lived in the house before we took it; we have had the house better than five months; a young couple left the three pair of stairs back room on that day, it was on a Sunday, they went away about a quarter before six o'clock in the morning, I knew they were to go; about a quarter past seven, I went into the room, and missed a sheet; I never suspected the prisoner, or any person then in the house; the prisoner was taken up, I think, on the Monday fortnight following, when a duplicate of the sheet was found.
I am a headborough of St. Luke's: I searched the prisoner's lodgings on Monday the 28th of September, the prisoner was not there; I found on the table some hats and caps, and in a hat-box I found a vast number of duplicates, and among them this duplicate of a sheet, for five shillings; I went with Mrs. Harnett to the pawnbroker's and saw the sheet; she looked at the corner of it, the marks were taken out, but she swore to its being her sheet.
I am a pawnbroker: I took in this sheet of the prisoner on the 29th of August, in the name of Ann Betts; she had been a customer at the shop a long while.
The mark has been taken out, it was marked E M H, the remains of the mark is very plain, it is exactly the same as my other sheet in every respect, I made them myself, and have no doubt it is the same sheet.
It never was Mrs. Harnett's sheet.
