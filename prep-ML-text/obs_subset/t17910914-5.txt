On the 27th of July last, coming up Fish-street-hill , the prisoner at the bar took a handkerchief out of my pocket; it was so dexterously done I did not immediately miss it, till Mr. Sutherland called me back, and he had the boy; I turned round, and saw my handkerchief in his hand. The boy was taken to Guildhall, and committed to prison. The constable has the handkerchief.
I live on Fish-street-hill, a groces; not being very busy, I was looking out, and observed Mr. Monkhouse go by, and the prisoner following him; and suspecting the boy, I saw him take the handkerchief very deliberately out of his pocket in a very compleat way, and put it into his side; I then took hold of the boy, and then called Mr. Monkhouse back, and asked him, if he had lost a handkerchief? he said, Yes; for I had a handkerchief about a minute or two before in my pocket.
I was coming up Fish-street-hill about one o'clock, and I saw a handkerchief lay under a cart, and I went and picked it up; and that gentleman there came up, and laid hold of me, and said I took it out of that gentleman's pocket.
