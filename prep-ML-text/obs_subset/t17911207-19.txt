I am employed by Messrs. Lucas and Spencer, the contractors: on Monday the 21st of November, at Spring-gardens , about three in the afternoon, there was a ladder raised to the lamp-iron; the prisoner was coming down, and on the last round; he had a tin oil-pot, and this glass, under his arm, which I took from him; the man went away; I said to him, what are you going to do with that lamp; he asked if it was mine; I said it was; how do you know that, says he, have you a mark on it; yes, there is a mark on it, says I, for you took it out of that iron; then, says he, if it is yours, I will put it up again; it is not yours, says he; it is mine, says I, and has a mark; then, says he, I will put it up for you; no, says I, I will save you that trouble; give it to me: what are you going to do with me, says he; I do not know, says I; if you will come along with me, we will decide whether it is your lamp or mine; says I, give it me; no, says he, I will put it up; I took the lamp out of his hand, and came home; he went away; I did not attempt to stop him then, as I thought him too much to encounter, and it was a private place; I did not see the prisoner till the next evening, about ten minutes after five, at Charing-cross; he was about his business, coming up to light the lamps round the statue, but somebody had lighted them; I was there to watch him, with my father and an officer; when we took him, he said nothing: the lamp-iron had no lamp in it.
I was in liquor.
He had no business that way, but he was in liquor; the prisoner works for Mr. Spikes, who contracts for the Board of Green Cloth.
Who contracts for the private lamps?
Not the master of this prisoner.
The lamplighter at the Horse-guards asked me to go to trim three lamps for him, and I could not, I was so much in liquor.
