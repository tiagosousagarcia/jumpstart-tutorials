- I am a smith and iron-founder ; John Clarkson is my partner; the prisoner was in my service about two years; On the 8th of November, about nine o'clock, as the men were going to breakfast, I had information that he had some of my property concealed about him; I waited in the accompting-house, and when I saw the prisoner going out, I called to him twice; the second time he came back; I told him I suspected he had some of my property about him, and that he had been robbing me; he said he had not; I insisted upon searching him, and the constable I had provided, and myself, felt in his pocket, and found the articles in this paper, (producing it) a pair of compasses, three pieces of iron, and some nuts and screws; a steel square I found concealed in his breeches; I cannot speak to these positively, but I suppose them to be my property; we found in his lodgings the other articles; this poker is mine, and these tongs; they were made up on purpose for the use of the shop; this file I know, because it has my own private mark upon it. (Produces them).
- I have worked for Mr. Bound for about ten years; this hand-vice is Mr. Bound's; I know it by having frequently used it; and these stocks also. (Produces them).
I am an officer: I found the articles in the prisoner's lodgings.
Those tools I bought of a man named John Powell; he died about four years ago.(The property was deposed to by the prosecutor).
