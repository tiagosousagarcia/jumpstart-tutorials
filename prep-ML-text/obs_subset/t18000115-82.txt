I keep the Bell and Crown, in Holborn : On the 8th of January, the prisoner came to my house in the evening, he went into the coffee-room and had some liquor, I understood the prisoner wanted a bed; I came out to see what sort of appearing man he was, and I let him have a bed; he was to pay one shilling and sixpence for it, he was to go by the Aylesbury coach; I was alarmed in the morning before eight o'clock, I dressed myself, and came down; I found the prisoner at the bar in the custody of my servant.
I am porter at the Bell and Crown, in Holborn, we were without a waiter, and I carried in two glasses of liquor; the prisoner said he was going to bed, that he was going by the Aylcsbury coach, and I settled the reckoning with him; the next morning I got up about five o'clock, and set off the Buckingham coach; between seven and eight o'clock I saw the prisoner come out of the house, and go down the gate-way; I went up stairs, as is customary when a stranger sleeps in the house, to see if all was right in the bed; I went up, and saw but one sheet upon the bed; I directly came down, and followed the prisoner, and caught him in Brook-street; I told him a gentleman wanted to speak to him, and would not detain him a moment; he said, what kind of a gentleman; I said he was a stranger to me; he said he would come by-and-by; I told him the gentleman could not stay, and he must go with me, and then he went with me; I took him up to the bed-room, with the chamber-maid, I unbuttoned his waistcoat, and there I found a sheet wrapped round his body; my master was called up, and he sent for a constable, and he was secured.
I was present when the prisoner was searched; I saw the sheet wrapped round his body, it belonged to Mr. Guy; there was but one left on the bed.
