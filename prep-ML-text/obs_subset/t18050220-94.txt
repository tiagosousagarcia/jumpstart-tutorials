You are one of the Common-Councilmen of the City of London?
I am; I live in Fell-street, I am a whalebone merchant.
How lately before you found the whalebone had you discharged one of your journeymen?
About a fortnight before I discharged a man of the name of John Floyd , he was a labourer; I had two other men at that time; John Floyd recommended me to Mr. Jeaneret, the corner of the Old Jewry, for a character, and afterwards to another.
Did the defendant recommend any person to you?
I was referred to him for a character for Floyd, but I could not find him.
Upon your discharging Floyd, what became of your other men?
James Clements and Thomas Beale left me on the Saturday night.
Had you missed any whalebone from your premises?
I had missed a quantity of manufactured goods, called Best British; it is whalebone; I am now speaking of the property that was afterwards found.
It is called Narrow Thomson and Middle Thomson here?
It is.
Had you missed them during the time those persons so described by you were in your service?
Yes.
While Floyd was in your service?
Yes; on the Thursday after Lord-Mayor's day, which I think was the 15th of November, Mr. James Martyn called upon me, and in consequence of what he told me I went the next morning to look at some whalebone at his warehouse in the Old Change; that is James Martyn , the witness; I recognized the whalebone to be my own manufactory immediately I saw it; it is my own work, I knew it directly I saw it. On seeing this whalebone I went to Thomas Martin, the defendant, and told him I wished him to go with me to the Mansion-house on particular business; I did not tell him for what; at that time I supposed him a respectable man, and did not wish to hurt his feelings; he told me he would go with me in about a quarter of an hour, that I think were his words, he was then at the King and Queen in Distaff-lane. He then went over into his warehouse, and told me he would be with me presently; he then came back again, and told me he would come to the Mansion-house in about a quarter of an hour. Finding him shuffling in that way I desired him to come directly; I went to the Mansion-house, and staid there about ten minutes, or a quarter of an hour, and not finding him there I came back again; I then went to the public-house, and not finding him there I went back again to the Mansion-house, and met with Mr. Read, the officer, and I brought Mr. Read with me to take him into custody, and he took him into custody.
Did he say any thing in your presence at the time he was taken into custody?
In the presence of James Martyn he did; he owned having sold that bone to James Martyn.
Are you sure that the whalebone that was produced at Mr. James Martyn 's was your's?
I am perfectly clear of it, I have no hesitation whatever.
Is that whalebone you saw at Mr. James Martyn 's in the same state you would have sold it at your warehouse?
Certainly not; it never went out of my warehouse sold in that state, nor from no other warehouse; it was merely in a preparatory state.
It was in a state that was never sold to any one?
No.
You had three men in your service, which three men you suspected were not honest men; one of them referred you to the defendant to give him a character - did he give him a character?
He did not, because I had not an opportunity of meeting with him; I went to where I was referred to; his warehouse I did not then know.
I am a whalebone-cutter, living in the Old Change.
Do you know the defendant, Thomas Martin ?
I do, I have known him about eighteen months.
Do you know what business he follows?
I do not.
Have you met him frequently during that time?
Frequently, almost daily.
Do you remember meeting him on any occasion, and when, at the King and Queen public-house?
I do perfectly well, on the 13th of November, in Distaff-lane.
That was the house you used?
Yes, and the house the defendant used. I went in the afternoon to take a pint of porter as usual; he said, I have got some whalebone to sell, and he immediately took a stick from underneath the bench from where he was sitting, and asked me to look at it; it was twisted up; I immediately took and untwisted the stick; he said, what is it worth; I said, is it all like this, as he said he had a parcel to sell, about half a hundred weight; he said he was no great judge of it himself; I told him if it was all like that, it might be worth a guinea, but I could not exactly tell till I had seen the bulk; he said it was too late that evening to see the bulk, but I might see it the next day at his warehouse opposite. Accordingly I thought no more of it that evening; nor the next day, but I met him the next day, and he said, now you may see the whalebone; I went with him over to the warehouse, and when I first saw it I was convinced of the circumstance; I said, is here fifty-six pounds; he put it in the scale, and it exactly weighed forty-eight pounds; I said, here is not so much as you said there was, it is not worth that, I will give you a pound-note for it; he said, I will take that, and I gave him a pound note for it; he said, if you will go over the way to the public-house with me, I will treat you with a shilling's worth of punch, and we went over the way; he said, I hope you will get plenty of money by it, for I have got plenty, I have got a seven-shilling piece by it; I told him I could not tell what I might get by it.
What was the value of that you bought?
I suppose, fairly between the manufacturer and the dealer, about three pounds. I immediately went to the first person in the trade to inquire about it, and afterwards found out Mr. Delvar, and went to him the next day.
How came you to offer so little value for it?
I supposed it to be some part of my own stock till I took the outside strings off, as I have had various porters with me at times; when I found it was not my own stock, I thought it my duty to let the trade know. I then communicated to Mr. Delvar what had passed; I told him he had better come and see the whalebone, and there he said it was his whalebone, when he came the next morning.
Do you remember hearing the defendant say any thing at all about this, in respect of purchasing it?
I do not recollect that he said how he came by it; at the Mansion-house he said he bought it for me, he told the Lord-Mayor so.
Do you remember, at the first time of his shewing it to you, whether he said he had bought some, or whether he could buy it?
He said he had it at the warehouse opposite.
This was at the public-house?
Yes.
Do you remember whether there was any other person present?
There were neighbours; there were one or two; in fact, there was a gentleman who does business for me - my attorney was there.
The worst man in the world to shew such a thing before him, is it possible - there might be some of your neighbours there when you paid him?
I do not recollect that there were.
You are one of the City constables, you apprehended the defendant?
Yes, at the King and Queen, in Distaff-lane, on the 16th of November.
Do you know what business he carries on?
He is a general dealer in every thing; there was almost every thing there; in his warehouse there was gum, drugs of different descriptions, and stuff that dyers use, I do not know the name of the stuff, and there were a great many other things; Mr. Delvar went with me when I searched the warehouse. I produce the whalebone, it was given to me by Mr. James Martyn , the last witness; I have had it ever since.
Do you recollect what he said at the Mansion-house?
He said he bought it at a sale, and it was an article that he was unacquainted with.
Do you mean to say that he said he had bought it at a sale - this was in Mr. Delvar's presence, he must have heard it?
I do not know whether he heard it.
Do you mean to say that before the Lord-Mayor he said he had bought it at a sale?
I would not have said it without he did; he did say he bought it at a sale, and that it was an article that he did not understand.
Is that your property?
I believe that to be my property, I have no doubt, I will identify it; in the first place, it is my own manufactory, and worked by my own hands; in the next place, when I saw this bone at Mr. James Martyn's warehouse, I knew it to be mine by the length; every half dozen and every half pound I have divided, so that there is an equal quantity of sticks to every half dozen; I have not the least hesitation whatever in saying, they are my property.
