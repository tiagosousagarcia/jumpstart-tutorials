I was mate of the Censor hulk; the prisoner was delivered on board the 19th of June 1784; he was missed the 27th of March, 1786; I cannot say how he escaped; I am sure he is the same man; I knew him perfectly well.
I found the prisoner at large the 26th of June last, at a public house the bottom of the Minories.
I saw it signed by the clerk of the assize.
Is there any other witness?
No other.
Who prosecutes?
Mr. Duncan Campbell .
How do you prove that this is the same man that was convicted at Winchester?
We have no other witnesses.
