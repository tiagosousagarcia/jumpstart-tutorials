I live down at the Hermitage-bridge , in the parish of St. Botolph, Aldgate ; I keep the St. Andrew public-house ; I lost two pint pots about the 10th of March; in the course of three or four weeks, I have lost two dozen of pots.
I am a publican; the prisoner, George Allen , came to my house on the 10th of March, about eight or nine in the evening, and called for a pint of porter; as I was coming past him, I saw he had a pint pot in his pocket, I put my hand in and took it out; I asked him how he came by that, he said, he had been and carried a pint of beer up as far as Burr-street, to one of his fellow servants; I said, why did he not carry it back again, he said, he was going to carry it back in the morning; I challenged him about it, and he wanted to sit down, and I pulled another out of a bag he had between his legs; I ordered the girl to run down to Mr. Lilly's, and desire him to come up; they were both Mr. Lilly's pots, his name was upon them; when Mr. Lilly's came, he sent for a constable, and charged the constable with him.
I am a constable; the pots were delivered to me at Mr. Clarke's house, these are the pots, I have had them ever since,(they were produced in Court, and deposed to by the prosecutor).
I was at work at the Glasgow Whars; as I was coming up, I saw the two pots standing by a post, I took them up and meant to return them to the owner, I could not read the name on them.
