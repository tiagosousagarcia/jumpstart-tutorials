I live with Mr. Ayres; the prisoner asked me for half a pound of candles, and threw down a bad shilling; Mr. Thomas came in, and I told the prisoner it was a bad one; I saw the four shillings and eight sixpences taken from the prisoner.
I have had this bad shilling ever since the 17th of July.
They are all bad.
