I am wife of James Anderson ; he lost a quart pot on the 15th of December, in the evening; it cost us sixteen pence; I found it upon the prisoner while he was drinking at our house; it was concealed in a large pocket; it is here. (Deposed to.) And in his left pocket I found some melted pewter.
I was in liquor, and put down the pot.
