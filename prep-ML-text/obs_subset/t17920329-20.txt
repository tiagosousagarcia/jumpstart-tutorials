I am a smith . I only prove the property.
On the 17th of March, in the evening, a little after eight o'clock, I missed the things mentioned in the indictment, and several others; I insisted on searching the prisoner; and on searching him I found these things; he told me he picked them up.
I work for Clowes. On the 17th Mrs. Clowes said, Mr. Williams I should be glad to search you; I did not refuse; nothing was found on me but my own property: then she said, Mr. Huggins, I wish to search you; upon that he put his hand in his pocket and pulled out the things, and said, I had like to have forgot, I have picked these things up, and forgot to give them to you.
I picked up the things, and went out to do a job; I really forgot to give them to my mistress.
