I keep an haberdasher's, milliner's, and hosier's shop , at the corner of David-street, Oxford-street . On the 7th of November, before nine in the morning, I went out of my shop into the parlour; a gentleman, who was in the parlour, told me there was somebody in the shop; I left no person in the shop, and had not been out of it two minutes; I turned my head immediately, and saw the prisoner and another man in the shop; I turned to go into the shop, and they ran out immediately; I pursued the prisoner across Oxford-street into Gee's-court opposite; I overtook him there; as I was going to take hold of him, I saw him drop a piece of muslin containing, about fourteen yards, a piece of lawn, about eight yards, and eight yards of handkerchief; he had them in a working apron which he had on; I immediately seised him; he asked me, what I took him for, that he never had the goods; I brought him and the goods back into the shop; all the goods had my private mark upon them; he was taken before the magistrate in Litchfield-street, who committed him.
I was walking by; a young man, very genteelly dressed, called to me, and said he would give me a shilling for my trouble, if I would go to 'Squire Baker's, in Portman-square; he put these things in my lap, and this gentleman stopped me with them.
To the Prosecutor. Was the prisoner ever out of your sight, from the time he went out of the shop, till you took him?
Never; I knew he was the person who had the goods, and I followed him.
