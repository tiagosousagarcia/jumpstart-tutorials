I am a cheese-monger . On the 15th of February, about a quarter after five, I was in the counting-house, and I heard a child say, a man has taken a ham; my boy, John Davis , pursued him.
I saw the prisoner take a ham, about five, on the 15th of February; I pursued after him; and took him with the ham under his arm, just turned the corner of Red-lion-street, Whitechapel; he was running as fast as he could; I never lost sight; and going to catch him, he dropped the ham; I saw him drop it; I picked it up: the ham is here; it has been kept separate: I know it to be one of my master's hams; it was hanging at the door then: when I came back there was a ham missing.
I never took the ham, I declare to God; I saw a young fellow drop it, in a red coat. I am a sailor .
