I am a porter to Grace Hoare , No. 114, Fleet street. On the 9th of December, between six and eight in the evening, the prisoner came to our shop, he said that he came from Mr. Dickenson for a pound of tobacco and half a pound of snuff; Ann Taylor served him, I packed up the tobacco and Ann Taylor packed up the snuff; we let him have this to the credit of Mr. Dickenson.
Then the prisoner came without paying for them.
Yes, we served him, thinking Mr. Dickenson would pay for them.
I live in Clare court, I have been a customer to Mrs. Hoare, but I have declined selling tobacco and snuff.
Did you request him, or give any authority, to go to Mrs. Hoare's shop for a pound of tobacco and half a pound of snuff.
I never did.
I did get the tobacco and snuff. I meant to have paid for it.
