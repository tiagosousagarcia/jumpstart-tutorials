Mr. Kershaw, my brother-in-law, keeps the King's-arms, in Newgate-street : On Friday, the 9th of May, about eight o'clock in the morning, the prisoner came to the bar for half-a-quartern of gin; I served her, and she gave me a sixpence; I thought it was a bad one, and sent out for change, and the servant brought word it was bad; she said she could not pay for her liquor, she had taken it in Whitechapel-market for a good one; I sent for a constable, and she ran out, and the servant ran after her and stopped her; the prisoner struck her in the mouth, and made it bleed; the constable brought her back, I saw her searched; the constable found upon her one shilling, and three or four bad sixpences.
I am a constable; I took charge of the prisoner, I searched her, and found three sixpences and one shilling upon her, and I received a sixpence from Mrs. Newty.
I did not know that they were bad, I picked them up in a piece of paper, in Fleet-market; I never was in jail in my life before.
