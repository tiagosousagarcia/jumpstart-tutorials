I am servant to Mr. Derbyshire; he is a wholesale grocer ; my master lost a quantity of goods on the 21st inst.; my master sent me with this parcel to the Windmill inn, St. John's-street; not knowing the inn, I passed it, and the bag was then in my cart; I stopped my horse and enquired for the Windmill, and they told me I was past it; presently after I missed the goods, and jumped out of the cart, and ran after the prisoner; I did not see the goods in possession of the prisoner, I saw them next day at Guildhall.
On the 21st inst. about a quarter past eight, coming down Turnmill-street I stopped the prisoner with the bag on his shoulder, I stopped him; he threw the bag down by which the rice parcels burst; I have kept them ever since and marked them.
I am a porter; I was at the corner of the Bowling-alley, in Windmill-street, and saw the prisoner stopped.
I was with Robert Newman ; I only know the same as my brother.
I live with a wood chopper, and had been out to sell some; on my return home a man asked me the way to Mutton-hill; I told him I was going that way, and he said if you will carry this parcel I will give you a shilling; going along Turnmill-street, these two (Newmans), stopped me.
