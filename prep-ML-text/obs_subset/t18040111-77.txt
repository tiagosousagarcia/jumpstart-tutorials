sworn. - I am a stationer , No. 775 Bethnal-green-road; I sent my little boy for the boots, and know nothing of the robbery but what he told me; he is eight years old.
Do you know the nature of an oath?
Telling lies.
Suppose you should tell what is false, what would become of you?
No, Sir, I have not told a story.
What would become of you if you did?
I should go to the naughty place. (Sworn.)
Did your father send you last Saturday for a pair of boots?
Yes, to Paternoster-row; I saw the prisoner by the place where the porters rest in Finsbury-square .
What did he say to you?
Nothing, but he took the basket away with the boots in it, and left the basket in Finsbury-square; a gentleman caught him with one of the boots.
Did you try to keep the basket?
Yes, I carried it before me.
Did you say any thing to him?
No, because I did not think he would snatch it.
He did not threaten you, did he?
No; a gentleman called out stop thief.
Where did you first see the prisoner?
In Cheapside; there were two of them.
What became of the other man?
I don't know, I did not see him run away.
Are you sure the prisoner was the person who took the basket?
Yes, he is the man.
Did he not ask you to let him carry it for you?
Yes, as he came by Cheapside.
And you gave it him?
No, he snatched it from me, and run away.
I was going through Finsbury-square, and passed the boy and two men together; I had not gone half a dozen yards before I heard the little boy call out he had lost his father's boots; I ran after the prisoner, and caught him; he attempted to throw one of the boots over the rail, but I caught it; the man with him ran the other way; I gave the boot and the prisoner into the hands of a constable.
