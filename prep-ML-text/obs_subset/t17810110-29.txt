I know the prisoner. She brought me three red curtains and two pair of silk stockings about five or six weeks ago; she asked me to pawn them for her because she was rather dirty.
Did she say any thing else about them?
No.
Did you carry them to pawn?
Yes; to a pawnbroker's in Long-acre.
What did you get for them?
I believe half a crown or three shillings; I gave the money to the prisoner.
Did she give you any account how she came by them?
She did not.
I am a pawnbroker; I live with Mr. Brown, in Long-acre. Two of these curtains I took in of the last witness; one on the 8th of November; the other on the 16th.
These are like the curtains I carried; I don't know that they are the very curtains; but I believe they are the same.
I am an apprentice to a Mr. Brown, a pawnbroker in Long-acre.
To Smith. Did you carry goods to any other persons busides Brown?
They both belong to the same shop.
Brown the last witness brought me two pair of silk hose and pawned them for twelve shillings on the 17th of November, and a curtain for three shillings on the 9th of December.
To Smith. You said the reason she gave you for desiring you to carry the goods to pawn was because she was rather dirty?
Yes.
At how many times did she bring them to you?
At three times.
How came you to carry them at four different times?
I pawned but three times; they were brought to me at three times.
I am as innocent as the child unborn. I have been in Drury-lane Theatre eighteen years. I was never charged before with any misdemeanour.
