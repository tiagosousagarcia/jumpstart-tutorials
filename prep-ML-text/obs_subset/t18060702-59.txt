I keep the Gun public house, Union street ; on Wednesday the 2nd of July this woman came into my house for half a pint of beer, which she drank and paid for, she then went into the yard; as she came along the passage to come out, she took a quart pot from the shelf and went out, I followed her and stopped her, and found it under her long cloak, she asked me to forgive her, I told her I would if she would tell me where she was going to take it to; I saw her take the pot as I was standing in my bar; I produce the pot, it is my pot.
I only beg for mercy, I would not hurt any person living.
