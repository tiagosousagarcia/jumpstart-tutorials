I am coachman to Mr. Lad, in Chapel-street, May-fair . My coat was on the box, in the coach-house, locked up in the same stable yard; I lost my coat on the same day, about half past five. The prisoner knew the premises as well as I did, he had been helper to me formerly, he had been about the yard all the day before; I went out, he had nothing to do in the yard; I found my things afterwards in Monmouth-street, afterwards at Mr. Maley's shop.
I met the prisoner in Coventry-street, I gave him two one pound notes, a seven shilling-piece, and two half crowns for the clothes, the great coat I afterwards sold to Mr. Maley.
I know nothing of it.
