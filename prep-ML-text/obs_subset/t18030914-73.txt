- I am wife of Thomas Dawson , a labouring man : The prisoner lodged with us; I missed the articles while she lodged with us, she left us the 7th of August without paying her rent, and took a petticoat with her which I saw upon her on the 18th; about seven or eight o'clock, the same night, she was apprehended; nothing else was found upon her.
- I lodge with Mrs. Dawson, I saw the prisoner take the petticoat off the line, but thought it was her own; I have seen it since upon her; it was found at the foot of her bed. (The petticoat produced and identified.)
I borrowed it of her while I mended my own; I carried it home twice, but she was not at home, and I took it home again for safety.
