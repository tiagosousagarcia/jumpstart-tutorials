I am a waterman ; my great coat was taken out of my boat on the 24th of March, at Allhallows-stairs , Thames-street ; I saw the prisoner at the stairs; when I landed my master, I went as far as Crooked-lane of an errand for a gentleman that I carried; I had put it under the tilt, and when I came back, the coat was missing; I found it in the possession of a person in Rosemary-lane, who bought it of the prisoner; I found it in about an hour or an hour and half after I missed it, (produced it) it is a gentleman's coat that was left in my charge; I am sure it is the same coat; I have had it in my charge these two years past.
I bought this great coat of the prisoner at the bar on the 24th of March; I gave him 7s. 6d. for it; I asked him if it was his own property, and he said, yes, he had just setched it out of pawn.
I stood in Upper Thames-street, against Calvert's brewhouse, and a soldier asked me if I would sell this coat for him, and I went and sold it for 7s. 6d.
