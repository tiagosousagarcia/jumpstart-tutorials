I am a publican , at the Marlborough-arms, Thornhaw-street, near Gower-street ; I swear to the pint pots.
I was at the kitchen window, and saw the prisoner come into the passage, and take the pots out; I followed her, and saw her throw the pots under a gate-way; I took her to Mr. Hill's.
I am not guilty.
