I am a baker; Mr. Barber, a Sheriff's officer, is a customer of mine: The prisoner came to my house on Friday, the 7th of December last, and asked for a quartern loaf and a quartern of flour; I served her myself; she said it was for Mr. Barber; I booked it, and sent in the bill on the Monday following; she had been in the habit of coming to me from Mr. Barber; she had been a servant of his.
I live in Wood-street; the prisoner had left my service about two months; she was in the habit of going to this shop, and had been trusted to pay the bills; when she was before the Lord-Mayor, I wished her to be reprimanded.
