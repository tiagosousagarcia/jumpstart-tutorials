The prisoner stopped me in the street on Saturday last, and took my bundle from me, in Church-street, St. Ann's , between eight and nine; I had it under my arm, the prisoner snatched it from me; he came on the other side of me, when I turned round he was five or six yards from me; I kept sight of him some way till a mob of people came in pursuit; I cried stop thief, and he was taken in Compton-street.
Was he ever out of your sight till he was taken?
Yes, when the mob of people came I could not see him for the throng of people.
Was the bundle found upon him?
Yes.
What became of the bundle afterwards?
It was brought to the watch-house.
Between eight and nine I was going home on Saturday evening, and I saw the prisoner running; I first heard a cry of stop thief, I saw the prisoner turn the corner of Dean-street with this bundle under his arm; I pursued him immediately, and about the second door, as I pursued him, I saw him drop the bundle; I was as near to him when he threw it away as I am to your Lordship; I took him, and a man delivered me the bundle, and the prisoner was committed.
On Saturday the 2d of April, about a quarter past eight, I heard the cry of stop thief, I looked back and saw the prisoner running; I pursued, I saw him drop the bundle, and in the very instant after he was seized and taken.
I saw the prisoner snatch the bundle out of the gentlewoman's hand, he run across the street, I cried out stop thief, he was immediately taken; I saw him taken, he never was out of my sight, he did not run many yards.
Who do the things belong to?
To one Mr. Lefevre.
