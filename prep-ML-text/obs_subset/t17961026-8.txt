I am a constable: On Friday the 23d of Sept. I was going along near the five mile stone at Highgate , I heard the cracking of a hedge belonging to Mr. Cox; I saw the prisoner pushing the sack over Mr. Cox's ground into the road; I followed him across the road into a stable; he carried it into a stable belonging to William Anderson; I saw him throw the potatoes upon the ground; I don't know whose potatoes they were, he threw it out of Mr. Cox's ground, the ground was planted with potatoes, the mould was quite damp about them. I did not examine the field afterwards; when I took him, he said, he hoped I would not take him before Mr. Cox, he would beg Mr. Cox's pardon, and hoped he would not prosecute him.
I had been with a load of coals to Hampstead brewhouse, my master told me to take a sack of chaff into the stable, I went with it, and Mr. Dutton came and told me I had stole the potatoes; I don't know how the potatoes came there, I did not take them, I told him I did not know any thing about them.
