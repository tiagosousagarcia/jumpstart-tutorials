I know the prisoner; I was present when he received sentence of transportation, that is the man (produces the certificate of conviction) I saw Mr. Shelton sign it. (It is read).
I am one of the officers of Bow-street; I apprehended the prisoner on the 24th of March last, at a public-house, in Holborn, at large.
I have not any thing to say.
