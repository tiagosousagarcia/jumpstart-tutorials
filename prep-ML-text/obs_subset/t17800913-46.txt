I am door-keeper to the Rotation office in the Borough. On the 28th of August, while I was standing talking to a young woman in Rosemary-lane, at her father's door, who keeps an iron shop; the prisoner came into the shop, and said, Young man, I wish you would withdraw, for this young woman and I want to change smocks; I said I shall not disturb you; the prisoner put something down; the young woman said I won't buy it; I looked round, and perceived it was a weight; she took it up again under her cloak, and went out; I followed her, and said I insisted upon seeing what she had got under her cloak, and saw it was an iron weight, with a broad arrow upon it; she said a man gave it her on Tower-hill to sell for him; I took her to Justice Clarke; at last she voluntarily confessed she was in liquor, and took it off the quays.
I am one of the warehousemen on the quays. The weight is his majesty's property, it is kept for the use of the custom-house.
I do not know what to say, I have no witnesses.
