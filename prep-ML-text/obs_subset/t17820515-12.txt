I am a shoemaker , in Old Gravel-lane . On the 29th of April, I lost a pair of men's shoes, worth 5 s. from out of my shop-window.
I am mother to the prosecutor; I live with him; I was a-bed in the shop, about eight or nine in the morning; I saw the prisoner come into the shop, and take a pair of shoes out of the window; I got out of bed in my shift, and ran to the door after the man, and called out, Stop thief!
I am a lighterman. Coming up from the water-side, on Monday morning, I met the prisoner with a pair of new shoes under his arm, about twenty yards from the prosecutor's shop; when I had gone a little further, the woman came out, and cried, Stop thief! I turned back directly, and run after him; he was running then; I saw him toss the shoes over a wall; myself and some others got up to him, and seised him; he denied having had the shoes; a lad got over the wall, where I directed him, and found the shoes.
I saw these shoes lying on the ground, and picked them up.
