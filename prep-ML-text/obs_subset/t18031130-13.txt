I live at Checquer-alley, Whitecross-street ; the prisoner was my servant , and quitted me on Saturday the 22d; I did not know the reason she did not come back, as she slept at home; I did not miss the articles till Sunday the 13th of November; my wife was confined to her bed; I was out; on my return, I missed the things out of my clothes-chest; the bundle was fetched home from the mangler's, and I looked to see they were right, and it contained the things named in the indictment. Suspicion fell on the prisoner; I applied to Edward Trigg , the officer, to go with me after the prisoner, and found she had given me a false direction; I then applied to St. Luke's charity-school, the prisoner having told me she had been in there, but they said she had not; the officer knew her, and we went to her mother's; I saw the mother; the officer opened the box in the room, and saw two new bonnets made up of cotton, which I believe to be mine; we searched, and found fifteen duplicates; we went and examined them at the pawnbroker's, but could not find the things. As we were going out of the shop, the officer called me back, saying, the prisoner said the things were there; the prisoner told the pawnbroker what they were, and he produced them.
I am a pawnbroker, and know the prisoner; I remember Ford, the officer, and her, coming to my shop, when she told me what the things were.
I live with Mr. Salmon, and produce several articles pledged on the 18th of October by the prisoner.
I am headborough of the parish of St. Luke's, and was sent for by Ford, and apprehended the prisoner, and asked her what she had done with the tickets; she said, she burnt them, but the goods were pledged at Mr. Salmon's; I made her no promises whatever; we went to the shop, and got them.
My master said he would not hurt me, if I would tell him where they were.
I did not; I had a particular reason for not doing it.
