Are you servant to Mr. Chambers?
Yes.
Was the prisoner his warehouseman ?
Yes.
Do you remember, on the 19th of September seeing him go out of your master's house, and tell us what you know?
Yes; between seven and eight, and took a bundle out under his arm, which I informed Mr. Chambers of.
I am constable of the parish of St. Giles: On Wednesday, the 19th of October, I went to the house of one Foss, the Black Horse, in Queen-street, Seven Dials, with Mr. Chambers, about nine o'clock; Foss pointed to a place, which I opened, and took a bundle out; it was a cupboard under the staircase in the tap-room; I opened the bundle, and it contained three Duffield great-coats, with shop marks on them; Mr. Chambers claimed them.
Did you know the prisoner before?
Yes, I have seen him many times, as I used the house; I had seen him that morning, about an hour before, in the tap-room, with a bundle under his arm, which he left in the house; he had something to drink, and as he went out of the back door, he said to the landlord, put it up; I apprehended the prisoner soon after, who immediately said, Lord have mercy upon me! have mercy on me! I had only told him he was my prisoner; I then took him to the Black Horse, and shewed him the bundle; he said it was his first offence, and hoped his master would forgive him.
Did he not mean, put the reckoning up to him as a score, and not the bundle?
I don't know; for my part, I thought he meant, put the bundle up; he went out at the door in a great hurry.
I am an officer belonging to Marlborough-street: I was sent for and went to Islington to search the prisoner's lodgings; no body was at home; I went to the prisoner in the watch-house, and he gave me the keys of his boxes; I went next morning, and found his wife and mother-in-law; I opened one box, and found it full of clothes of different descriptions, and the other full of wearing-apparel, with shop marks on them.
I leave my defence to my counsel.
