I keep a clothes-shop in Whitechapel : I have lost a great number of things; I know the prisoner, she lives near me; I know nothing of the robbery.
I live near Mrs. Moses; I have seen the prisoner going backwards and forwards in the neighbourhood: I saw her go into Mrs. Moses's house on the 2d of May, she might stay about a quarter of an hour; she came out with a small bundle under her arm, and a mackerel in her left-hand; the things were hanging at the door, and she stood some minutes as if she was looking at the things; she laid hold of some white petticoats, and then the laid hold of a cloak; she kept fumbling at it a good while, at last she got it down; then I saw her go into a chandler's-shop, where she resided; she did not discern me, I was sitting at my own window opposite, and had got the window up; she might have seen me; I went in, and asked Mrs. Moses if she had sold the cloak; and she said, no, and went in pursuit of her.
I am an officer: On Friday the 2d of May, I was sent for to Mrs. Moses's house; I went, and took the prisoner into custody, they had got her in the house; I searched her, and in her pocket I found this cloak.
I know this to be my cloak; I know it by particular marks.
Mrs. Moses had two guineas to make it up; I bought the cloak.
