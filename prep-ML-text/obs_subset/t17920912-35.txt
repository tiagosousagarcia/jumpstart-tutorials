I am a carpenter; the prisoner was my journeyman ; on the 3d of September, a few minutes before seven, I saw Cooper coming down stairs, with his basket in his hand; and thinking he was too soon to leave work, I followed him, and saw lead in his basket; and I thought it too flagrant to be overlooked; and I watched him in to an old iron shop; I then went to a constable, and secured him in the shop; we took him to the new police office in Marlborough-street; I found the lead in his basket, when I returned with the constable; I was not gone a minute; I compared the lead, it belonged to a gutter of a front house, in which the prisoner had no business; it appeared to have been cut a week by the workmen, and deposited a week.
I really believe it to be part of my lead, having compared it.
