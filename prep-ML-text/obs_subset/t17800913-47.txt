I carry on business for Charles Ellis and James Scott , wax-chandler s at Hampstead . On the 29th of August, nineteen pounds of white wax were stopped; I did not miss it till it was stopped.
I am a wax-chandler, and live at the corner of Charlotte-street, Bloomsbury. On the 24th of August, I stopped nineteen pounds of white wax; it was brought to me by the prisoner; I had seen him once before, but I did not know where he lived; I put it into my scale, and weighed it; I said, My friend, here is nineteen pounds weight of it, look at the weights; he said, master, I will trust to you; I said, I suppose these goods are stolen, if you can prove they are your property, or you are sent to sell them, I will pay you for it; he was on the outside of the counter; he said, O master, that I can soon do! In the interval, a coach with some people stopped at the door, I thought they might belong to the prisoner; he went out; I went round the counter to the door, the prisoner was then gone, there were some women at the door; one said, Who is that dare stop my property? I went round to the trade, and likewise to Sir John Fielding , to inform them I had stopped some wax; I went at last to Messrs. Ellis and Scott's, in Bond-street; Mr. Ellis came and looked at the wax; I described the man to him, and on the 29th of August he brought the prisoner to my shop; he confessed the fact to me, Mr. Ellis, and Mr. Scott; he said necessity drove him to take it, and begged to be let off.
This wax is my manufacturing, part was taken out of the bleaching-ground, and part out of the melting-room.
Are you certain it is your manufacturing?
I am.
I found this in a bag, I expected some owner would come for it; none coming for it, I went to sell it.
