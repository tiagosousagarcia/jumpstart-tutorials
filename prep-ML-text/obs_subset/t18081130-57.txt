I am a cheesemonger , I live in Lower East Smithfield . On Thursday evening the 3d of November I lost two cheese marked with an M. I do not know what time it was in the evening. They were placed about three yards inside the shop door.
What is the value of them
About sixteen shillings. I did not miss them till the next day. From information I went to Lambeth street office and owned the property.
I am an officer in the impress service. On the evening of the 3d of November, between seven and eight o'clock, I was going from Tower hill towards St. Catherine's; I heard a noise, and saw the prisoner running from St. Catherine's lane towards me; I supposed him to be a sailor running from some of my men; I stopped him, and he dropped two cheese; as soon as I stopped him I asked several questions; he told me he took them from a boy. I took him to the constable's house; I went with the constable and patrol, and saw him locked up in the cage.
He may have been running away from your men
I thought so; he had not the appearance of a sailor.
JOHN - I am beadle of the parish. The prisoner was brought to me on the 3d of November by the patrol and the press master.
What had he
Two cheese. I asked him how he came by the cheese; he told me that a boy was running down New street, he dropped two cheese, he took them up, and was following of the boy as there were two men after him.
I am a patrol. I took the prisoner to the beadle.
to Davis. In your going to Tower hill from St. Catherine's, was any body running before him
There was a boy running before him, I did not take notice of him, my object was the man.
I believe two boys took them out while I sat at the table; there were two boys there that robbed me of two pence halfpenny the week before.
I have worked in the London docks three years. After I had done my work I was going down St. Catherine's lane, I saw two boys chuck the cheese down. I picked them up.
Why did you run
I did not run.
