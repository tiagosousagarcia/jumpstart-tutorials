I live in Beech-street ; I lost 24 yards of linen cloth, on Friday the 30th of December, between four and five; I was at the farther end of my shop, serving some company, reaching some goods to shew; happening to cast my eye at the door, I saw the back of a person going out of the shop; I immediately ran to see who it was, and what he wanted, and saw the prisoner at the bar with the roll of Irish under his arm, about four or five doors from my own shop; I laid hold of his collar, and brought him back with it under his arm.
