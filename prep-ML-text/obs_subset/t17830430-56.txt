On the 31st of March, about a quarter after eight, the prosecutor told me he had lost his watch, and asked me to go round to the pawnbrokers, I went to several and did not find it, and as we were coming along, I said, let us call at the Black Dog, in St. Giles's, and I saw the prisoner with three girls of the town, and as he came along he pulled up the flap of his waistcoat, and was looking at the seal, I asked him how the watch went he had taken, he said, he had no watch, I pulled it out of his pocket; then he said, he only took it to look at.
I was going up stairs with a pot of beer, and coming down again I picked the watch up on the stairs, and I went to get change for sixpence, and that gentleman laid hold on me.
How far was it off where you saw the prisoner?
About one hundred yards.
