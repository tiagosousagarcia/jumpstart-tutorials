I am the wife of Aaron Moses; I have known the prisoner ever since May, she chaired for me; I had a sick child that would not go out of my arms, and I entrusted her to do all that I wanted done. On Wednesday, the 17th of October, I sent her up to make my bed; she was gone up a considerable while making the bad longer than I thought fit; I put the child out of my arms, and went up stairs to see what she was about; when I came up stairs, I turned round, and not seeing her, and the drawers being open, I cried and screamed out, Jenny has robbed me; my husband was in the country, and my son was out. On the Saturday night after, my son happened to go into the Borough with an acquaintance, and saw her coming out of St. Thomas's-street; he took charge of her, and I was sent for to see her in the Compter; the officer found sixteen duplicates upon her; some of them were of my property.
I am an officer of Cheap-ward; I was sent for to the Poultry Compter; I had charge of the prisoner for several robberies; I searched her, and found a vast number of duplicates upon her, and from that the prosecutor's property was discovered.
On the 20th of October I was going to the Stone's-end, and at the corner of Thomas's-street, I saw the prisoner; I told her I was looking for her; I could not get a constable, and I put her in a coach, and drove to the Poultry Compter; I found upon her neck an old silk handkerchief of mine, which I had worn for a pocket-handkercheif; Fennell took it off her neck.
This handkerchief she took away on the 17th, she ironed it herself on the 15th.
My husband has been dead three years; I had some things in pledge that Mrs. Moses wanted to buy, and she let me have these things to get them out with, to see whether she would like them or not, and I went to see a sister of mine for a day or two, and as I was coming out of Thomas's-street, a man met me and took me to the Compter.
