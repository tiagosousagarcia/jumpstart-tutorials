I am a cutler , I live in Russel-court, Covent-garden . On Thursday last I lost a satin wood knife case; it was taken off the counter in the shop, the prisoner came in and there was nobody in the shop, he came in and took up the knife case and immediately set off with it; I cried, stop thief! and he was stopped with it; I am positive he is the man.
I heard the cry of stop thief, I see the prisoner, went after him, and followed him down a court, he wanted to get away from me but I took him, and took him to Bow-street.
I was going down White Hart-yard, I heard the cry of stop thief, this man came up to me at the corner of White Hart-yard, and struck at me, and the prosecutor came up and said, that knife case is mine, I will swear to it.
