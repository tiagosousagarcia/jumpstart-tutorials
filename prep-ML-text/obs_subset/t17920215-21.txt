I am a widow; I lost a shirt on Friday the 20th of January; I hung out several shirts between eleven and twelve; I saw they were all there; I missed one shirt between three and four; I suspected Peter Millar ; the constable found the shirt; he said he meant to bring it to me on the morrow morning; it was tucked in between the lath and plaster, in his bed-room; the constable took it out; I was present; I said, that is my shirt, it is marked with two F's; I am a washerwoman; the constable has had it from that time to this.
I took it from the boy's room.
Please you, my Lord, I met a man in Hampstead, and he asked me if there was a pawnbroker's in the town; I said, no; he said, I have got a shirt to sell for 2 s.; he asked me to buy it; I said, I would ask the coachman; I took it to the coachman, and he said he would lend me 2 s. to buy it for myself, as he did not want any thing of the kind.
