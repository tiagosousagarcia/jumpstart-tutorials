These things were left in my chambers when I went out of town last year. I lent my chambers to Mr. Watkins till my return. The prisoner was Mr. Watkins's servant . When I returned to town in February, I missed the things mentioned in the indictment. I found my drawer at the bottom of the escrutore had been robbed.
I am servant to the prosecutor. Seeing accidentally a waistcoat of my master's hanging up at a clothes-shop for sale, I traced it to the prisoner. I found that he lived in a court by St. James's. Swift, the constable, and I went to his lodgings; we found him in bed. There was a trunk, the key of which he had in his pocket. We opened it and found the clothes mentioned in the indictment. I believe them to be my master's property. The stockings have my master's mark upon them.
A Spanish nobleman brought me from my own country into a strange country. I know not the nature of the law. He kept me in misery and distress; he never paid me. Mr. Watkins used me ill; he struck me; I was obliged to leave him. I was born in Germany.
