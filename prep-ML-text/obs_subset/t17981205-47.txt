I am the father of Mary Driver: The prisoner drew my daughter in, I never knew any thing of it till two days after; I never saw him till afterwards.
I am clerk of St. Leonard, Shoreditch; these are true copies from the register-book, I have examined them, (reads) \"John Aird, of this parish, Batchelor, and Sarah Geare , of this parish, spinster, were married in this church, by banns, this 27th day of March, 1786, by me Joseph Cookson , curate. This marriage was solemnized between us, in prefence of Richard-Porter Scott, George Limming.\"	"s
The prisoner was a lodger of mine at the time of the first marriage; Sarah Geare and he lived together as man and wife.
Is she now living?
She was living when I was sent for to go to the Justices, three weeks ago last Monday.
Were you present at the marriage?
No.
About the year 1791, I enlisted in the 37th Regiment, and was at the siege of Dunkirk; When I came home, I found my wife married to another man, and children by him, and I did not like to trouble her for it; I got acquainted with this girl, and I married her; I did not know I was violating the law; Maria Driver's Mother was the sole promoter of the marriage.
This is a true copy from the registerbook, I wrote it myself.
