I am a victualler , I keep the King's Head in Smithfield . I can only speak to the property.
I live with Mr. Roebuck. Last Friday night as I stood in Smithfield, I saw the prisoner go up the King's-Head yard and take a pewter chamber-pot off the top of a water-tub and put it under the skirt of his coat. As he came out of the yard I stopped him, and asked him what he had got; he said only a parcel he had left there. I took the pot from him.
As I was going along a horse ran against me and knocked me down; I went into this yard to wash my hands; as I was wiping them on the tail of my coat, this man came came up and knocked me down without saying a word me; I was all of a gore of blood.
