I am a shoe-maker , in King-street, Seven Dials , on the 6th of July, Friday evening, I missed the shoes, the prisoner came into the shop, and desired to be fitted with a pair of shoes; my lad attended him, I was busy with other customers; I was told the man had put a pair of shoes in his pocket, I saw him pull them out of his pocket (these are the shoes) Hawkes has kept them ever since; I know them by the binding and the manufacture; these shoes were never tried on by the prisoner, they are two inches too small for him; on being searched, there was half-a-crown and a shilling found upon him.
Had not this man half-a-guinea?
Not that I known of.
I am a servant to Mr. Read, the prisoner came in and asked for shoes; I shewed him several pairs, at last I went round to look for some shoes in a box behind him; I went into the parlour and informed Mr. Hawkes I had suspicion of the prisoner's having a pair of shoes; he was in the parlour, and he came out soon after, and said to Mr. Archibald, this man has taken the liberty of taking a pair of shoes.
I accused the prisoner with taking a pair of shoes, he then pulled them out of his pocket, and said they are what I meant to have; I have kept the shoes ever since.
I am watchman, I was called in and searched him; I found half-a-crown and a shilling.
I am constable; the prisoner was brought before me, and I found half-a-crown and a shilling, which was returned to him; in the morning he told me that he did not know the nature of the place, but that he had half-a-guinea more, which he concealed in his mouth, as he did not know but it might be taken from him.
