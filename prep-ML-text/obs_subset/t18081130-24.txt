I am a carpenter , I live at No. 10, Flower street, Whitechapel . On the 31st of October last, I left the house to go to my employment, I returned home at seven; I found these articles gone; I was informed the prisoner had been enquiring for me, she formerly had lived in the house as a lodger; on the 1st of November about one o'clock, I saw this girl in Harrow alley, Petticoat lane; I asked her what she wanted at my house and what she wanted with me; she told me she had not been there, and she wanted nothing of me; I told her she had been there; I had a strong suspicion that she had robbed me of the things I had lost; she denied it; I sent for an officer. She confessed every thing at the office.
I am the wife of the last witness. On the 31st of October I left my house about two o'clock; I returned about half after four, then I missed these things out of my room.
I am a pawnbroker in Wood street, Spitalfields On the 31st of October, in the evening, (I believe the prisoner to be the girl, I will not swear positively because I may be wrong) she pledged a pair of boots, a gown and breeches, and some trifling articles, for twelve shillings.
I am an officer. On the 1st of November, I took the prisoner in custody; she was crying very much, she said she had pawned the things. I asked her what she had done with the money; she produced ten shillings, she said that was part of the money she had pawned them for at Mr. Langar's; she had this bonnet on her head, which the prosecutrix claimed; I think she said she had destroyed the duplicate. I searched her and could not find it.
I gave him ten shillings; and I told him if he would go to my father he would make up the money.
to Smith. Did you know her before
Yes; she was at our office once, she lived at a public house and took a paper of halfpence; I believe she is very young, and her father has died; she has been in confinement about a fortnight ago.
