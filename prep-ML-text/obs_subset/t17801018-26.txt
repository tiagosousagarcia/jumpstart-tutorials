I am a watchman. On the 10th of October, I saw two men going along near Old-street, one of them with a bundle; the prisoner was the other man; I was close behind him; it was ten o'clock at night; I stopped them, upon crossing the way; and turning my rattle , the man dropped the bundle, and ran away; the prisoner, who was behind that man, stopped; I went up and secured him.
Upon Barns's turning his rattle I came up, and saw this bundle, containing the goods mentioned in the indictment, upon the ground.
They were taken out of a chariot, which came in that evening.
He promised me, if I told him nothing but the truth, he would forgive me, and make me an evidence, and he supplied me with money while I was in Bridewell.
