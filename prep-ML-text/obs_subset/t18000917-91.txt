I am an optician : On the afternoon of Thursday, the 14th of August, about four o'clock, the prisoner came into my shop, No. 29, Essex-street, Whitechapel ; I can only speak to the property.
I am a glazier and painter: On Thursday, the 14th of August, I was at work near the prosecutor's house; I saw the prisoner at the bar, in company with another boy, go into the prosecutor's shop; I saw the prisoner go to the window, and lift the curtain up; I saw that he had taken something from the window; the two boys came out together, and turned to the left-hand; I then walked towards them, and beckoned to the prosecutor to come down stairs; I followed the boys into a little alley, behind the houses where I was at work; I then laid hold of the prisoner, the other made his escape; he then threw the two opera-glasses from under his waistcoat, and, with a shut of his mouth, threw them down in the mud; the son of the prosecutor picked them up, he is here; I took the boy back to Arnold's house, a constable was sent for, and he was given in charge.
I am the son of the prosecutor; I picked up the opera-glasses which were delivered to the constable.
I am a constable (produced the property) I know these-opera-glasses; they are marked T. Collinson.
That mark was put upon them after they were picked up?
Yes.
They have no shop-mark?
No; one of them is a very particular one; the object is let in different to what they generally are, and the eyeglass is larger than it ought to be; I have no doubt of their being mine.
A boy gave me these glasses to have a glass put in; and when I went into the shop, I could not find any body, and I came out again, and then that gentleman laid hold of me.
