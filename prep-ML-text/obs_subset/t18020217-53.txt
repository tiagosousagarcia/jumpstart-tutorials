I live in Old-street-road , and keep a house there; the prisoner took a lodging of me the 16th of last month, ready furnished; she took possession, and left it the same day; the articles stated in the indictment were there; the next day I found some of them at Mr. Sherwood's, in Smith's-buildings, Angel-alley, Bishopsgate-street; and some I found at a pawnbroker's.
I have known the prisoner some time; she came in the afternoon of Saturday, the 16th of January, and asked me if she might leave some things at my house; I consented, and in the evening, after dark, she brought a bolster, two blankets, and a sheet; on the Wednesday following, the prosecutor came, and I shewed them to him. (The articles produced, and identified by the prosecutor.)
I apprehended the prisoner, and found the things produced at Sherwood's.
I did not mean to wrong these people, I had lived with them five months before, and he never found me dishonest; the week was not up till the Wednesday.
