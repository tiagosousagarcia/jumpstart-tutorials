I keep the Ship and Horseshoe public-house , in Nightingale-lane, East-Smithfield ; the prisoner; who is a seafaring man , lodged at my house one night; in the morning, as he was going out, I thought he looked rather thicker in the body than the night before, therefore I followed him, and said, I thought he had got something of mine; he said, no, but I took him back; then, he said, I beg your pardon, I have got a sheet, and pulled it from underneath his shirt; I then took him into custody.
I had no money to pay for my lodging; or to support me, so I meant to pawn the sheet, in order to pay him, and to take it out again.
