You are a poulterer , in Leadenhall-market ?
I am: On Saturday, I think the 15th of December, about eight o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came to purchase a goose; she offered a dollar in payment for it; I went with the dollar into Mr. Glover's shop, a neighbour of mine, knowing that he had a balance with which he weighed dollars, and upon weighing it we found it was light; Mr. Glover then took it out of my hand and rubbed it on a steel; after that, he returned it to the prisoner at the bar; I told her I did not think it was a good one, and I would not take it; she then said she would leave her basket and the goose, and bring me the money presently; she left the basket and the goose.
I had dealt with the gentleman often before.
Had you known her before?
I had seen her twice.
You were applied to by the last witness to examine a dollar.
Look at that?
This is the dollar; here is the mark I made upon it; I said to her, you know it is a bad one as well as I do; I returned it to her, and she went to Mr. Barber's, who is an egg-merchant, and deals in butter, up Ship-tavern passage, in Leadenhall-market, about five doors from my house, on the same side of the way; I followed her for the purpose of watching her; there were a number of butter-flats piled up; I stood behind them, and heard her ask the price of two lumps of butter; she agreed for the price, and went into the accompting-house to pay for it; I saw the clerk found a dollar, and upon hearing it found I thought it was the same, or one similar; I went in, and said to Mr. Barber's clerk - \"this woman is offering you a bad dollar, and she knows it is a bad one, I have just convinced her of it; Mr. Barber's clerk desired her to go about her business; I went to my own shop, and she immediately came to me and abused me very much, and said, if she took the devil she had a right to pass it again; I examined the dollar at Mr. Barber's, and found it was not the dollar I had rubbed upon the steel; I take so many that I am partly a judge of them, and I knew that to be a bad one; when she abused me, I told her, if she did not go about her business, I would send her to the Compter; she then went to Mr. Dawson's again, and told him she would come for that goose directly; I watched her to Mr. Wood's, the Poulterer's Arms; I saw her go in; she stopped some time, and I saw a man sounding a dollar upon the table; being a busy time, I went away, and sent my lad, John Marsh , to follow her, and a lad of the name of Davies likewise went with him; I did not see her again till she was in custody; she then said she was innocent, and I gave charge of her; I did not see any thing found upon her.
Where do you live?
I live with Mr. Brasier: I went with Mr. Glover, and saw the prisoner go into the public-house and call for half a pint of something to drink; I stood there about half an hour, and Mr. Glover went to his customers; she shewed a gentleman a dollar; I was watching her; they shoved her out of doors, and then she went into the Poultry-market, behind the pump, and kept stooping several times, for near half an hour or twenty minutes; I then called John Marsh and Thomas Glover ; I saw her stoop several times afterwards; Thomas Glover went up and said, what are you doing; she said, only doing up my shoe; let us see, said Thomas Glover , and he immediately picked up a dollar, it was buried under ground; she tore my waistcoat, and abused me very much; we took hold of her, and she went a little farther, and chucked down another dollar, which John Marsh picked up, and then she said she would be d - d if she would go any farther without a constable.
Did you pick up a dollar?
Yes, by the pump; there were some ashes raked over it.
Look at that?
That is the dollar I picked up; when I first saw her she was stooping behind the pump; she wiped her hand at the same time.
Were you with Davies?
Yes, and Thomas Glover ; we were present when the prisoner was apprehended; she threw away a dollar, which I picked up behind the shutters; I gave it to the constable.
Look at that dollar?
That is the dollar I picked up.
(To George Glover .) Look at that dollar which Marsh picked up - is that the dollar that you had rubbed upon the steel?
It is the same dollar.
Is it silver, or not?
I am confident it is not.
You are one of the tellers of the Bank of England - look at those dollars?
I was down at Mr. Bolton's at Birmingham when the whole were stamped; in the first place I am confident they are not of that die, and in the next place that they are base metal.
Have they the resemblance of the Bank dollars?
Yes; but any person in the habit of taking dollars might see they are counterfeit.
I know no more of what is laid to my charge than God upon his throne; I have dealt with Mr. Glover four or five years.
