I am the wife of James Mulligan ; I lodge in West-street, Smithfield ; I employed the prisoner to wash for me; I take in washing; my husband has had a paralytic stroke, and is in the workhouse: On the 16th of September I went out between eight and nine in the morning, and when I came home in the evening, I missed a shirt that a gentleman had left with me that morning to be washed; I left my daughter at home; I had made the shirt; I saw it afterwards before the Magistrate; I found the prisoner in my apartment very much in liquor.
Her daughter sent me to pledge it for liquor; I often pledge things for them both.
