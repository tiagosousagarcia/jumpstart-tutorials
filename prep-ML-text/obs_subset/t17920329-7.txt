I live with the Rt. Hon. Lord Douglas: on the 15th of January last I went into the house to lunch; I came back, and missed my watch; I left it in my clothes, up stairs, in my bed-room; I could hear nothing of it; the prisoner was a helper in the stables; we could not find him; I missed my money afterwards, which was two guineas and some silver; I do not say the prisoner is guilty; I pursued him no further.
On Monday morning, the 16th of January, this said man went into a publick-house, and the landlord of the house sent to me on suspicion; I searched the prisoner, and found one guinea and a half in gold, 3 s. and 5 1/4 d. and the watch; the constable took the watch.
I was present at the search; I saw the watch found in the prisoner's pocket, and the money; I have it here.
I beg for mercy.
