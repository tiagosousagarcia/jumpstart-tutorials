I am in partner ship with George Seddon , in Aldersgate-street .
I am clerk to Mess. Seddon; the prisoner was employed in the feather-room; on Friday the 8th of October, about six o'clock, I had some suspicion, and informed Mr. Thomas Seddon of it; a constable was sent for, and when the prisoner left his work, the constable followed him; he went two or three yards out of the gate, and the watchman and I called him back into the accompting-house; he came back, and I saw him searched; a small bag of feathers was found upon him, and some wood in his inside coat-pocket; as soon as he was searched, I let Mr. Thomas Seddon know; I don't know who the bag belonged to; I cannot swear to the bag or the feathers; I did not see any thing remarkable about them.
I am clerk to Mess. Seddon; I saw the prisoner searched, and the bag of feathers taken from him.
It is next to impossible to swear to feathers; but I have no doubt they are mine; they are the same sort of feathers that we had in the feather-room; the bag I cannot swear to.
