- I am a higler : On Friday the 25th of September, I lost my property in Whitechapel ; I brought seven ducks to town, tied under my cart; I saw them safe when I was at Whitechapel-church; I did not miss them till the prisoner and the property was brought back to me at the corner of Red-lion-street; I know the basket to be mine; it was a wicket-basket that I had made for me. (Produces it).
- I saw the prisoner take the basket of ducks upon his shoulder, near Essex-street, Whitechapel; I went in pursuit of him, and then he dropped it; he was stopped at the corner of Red-lion-street; I believe the prisoner is the same man; the prosecutor claimed them; I had the care of the basket till the next day.
I picked up the basket in Whitechapel, and this man came and knocked it off my shoulder; I have a witness here that saw me pick it up.
- I am a soldier belonging to the West London militia; I have been in the regiment six years; I saw a basket like this lying in the road, as I was coming along Whitechapel High-street; it stood upon its bottom; I looked at it for the space of two minutes, I suppose; I looked to see where it came from, but I could see nothing; I then saw the prisoner pick it up, and the patrol ran after him, and called out stop thief, and then I found myself very comfortable that I had not meddled with it.
Did you know any thing of the prisoner before?
No farther than being children together; I never knew the lad so as to be in any correspondence with him. NOT GUILTY .
