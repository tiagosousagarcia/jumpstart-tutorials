I was robbed the night after Christmas night, in Old-street , about six in the evening; I had been in the City Road, but I was going home, and in Old-street I was knocked down; I did not see any body before I was knocked down; the prisoner came behind me; my watch and money was taken; I lost two guineas and a half in gold, a crown piece, a dollar, and two shillings in silver; I cannot be positive which of the men took it from me; there were three of them; I knew the two that were tried before; I cannot swear to the prisoner; the three men that robbed me were taken before Mr. Staples, and he ordered them here; I cannot say I know what became of them after they robbed me; they ran away from me.
How soon was this man taken afterwards?
It might be a fortnight after; I cannot positively say; there was no property found on this man.
I believe the prisoner to be the man that struck me when I assisted my brother.
Was you with him when he was robbed?
Yes, but not when he was knocked down; I was a little before him; I went to him; I saw Walker take the watch out of his pocket; my brother was laid on the ground, and three men beating him.
Had you light enough to see who the three men were?
It was not dark; there was a little snow on the ground; it was so light that I did know them again; the snow made it lighter; the lamps were lighted; I had light to know some of them again; I believe this is the man; I cannot swear to him; but I believe he is the man that struck me; but I am not sure of it.
I apprehended the prisoner; I found nothing on him.
There is no evidence to convict this man of a capital felony.
