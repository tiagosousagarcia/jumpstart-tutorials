I am a tailor, in Chapel-street, Grosvenor-square: A little after six o'clock in the evening of the 1st of November, I was drinking tea at my house, with a missionary who was lately come from abroad, of the name of Beattie; I came out and found the street-door open; I shut it; it had a latch upon it; and in turning round, I saw a man on the stairs, about half way up; I took him into custody; I took him to the Magistrate's that evening; when I went into the bed-room, adjoining the room where we were, I found this shirt, (producing it) among other things, removed from its place; he had no implements of any kind about him, and he behaved no way improperly.
I am the wife of Thomas Robson; it is my husband's dwelling-house: On the 1st of November I had shut the latch of the door about twenty minutes before the prisoner was detected; we were in the parlour drinking tea; there were children in the room, and we heard no other noise.
Was there any property lost?
None at all.
What passed between you and the prisoner?
He said he had not taken any thing.
I was told that one Mr. Brown lived there, a captain of a West-Indiaman, who owed me some money; I knocked at the door, but nobody answered; I lifted up the latch, and went in.
The prisoner did say that he was informed Captain Brown lived there.
