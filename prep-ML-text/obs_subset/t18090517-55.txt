I live with Mr. Wood, pawnbroker , in Old-street . On the 24th of April, the next witness came into the shop, and from her information I followed the prisoner and fetched her back; she opened her apron, and these stays fell out of her apron. They had been hanging on the door, inside of the shop. They belong to Mr. Wood. I had seen them half an hour before.
Did you see the prisoner in the shop or about it
No.
I was passing by Mr. Wood's, the pawnbroker, in Old-street, I saw the prisoner unpin the stays and put them under her petticoats; I immediately went in the shop and told the young man; he ran out and catched her with the stays upon her.
I was in sad distress, which drove me to do what I did; I have two children. My husband has been dead six years.
