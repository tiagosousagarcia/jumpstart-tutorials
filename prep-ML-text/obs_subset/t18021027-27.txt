I am apprentice to Mr. Clarke, in Shoreditch : On Friday, the 17th of September, about five o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner came into Mr. Clarke's shop, and lent himself over, on the counter, where some soap, was lying, and said give me some blue; I told him we did not give blue away; I would sell him some; I was packing up some goods in the middle of the shop, and called the other apprentice to serve him: he served him two ounces of blue, which he paid three halfpence for; he then went away, and in about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour afterwards, Mr. Ekelso came into the shop; I had not then missed any soap; he informed me he had stopped a man with a cake of soap.
I am apprentice to Mr. Clarke; I served the prisoner with two ounces of blue; he lolled over the soap place; he paid me for the blue and went away; I did not then miss the soap; afterwards Mr. Ekeiso came in, and I missed a cake of mottled soap that I had cut a small corner off just before as a sample; the small bit was left on the counter.
On the 17th of September, about twenty minutes after five, I saw the prisoner come down Mr. Clarke's stable-yard;I was at my own stable door, in the same yard; the prisoner passed by me with a cake of soap, not in paper, under his coat; after he had passed me, I suspected him, and followed him into Magpye-alley; I tapped him on the shoulder, and asked him how he came by that soap, he said he did not know; he then said he had bought it of a Jew in the street; I took him to Worship-street-office.
This is the cake of soap that I cut the corner from; that was the largest piece there was on the counter.
I was going to a timberyard; I am a box-maker; I met with a Jew, who asked me if I would buy some soap of him; he asked me two shillings for it, and I gave him nineteen pence, and a quartern of gin.
