I am a single woman: I lost the things mentioned in the indictment on Thursday the 17th of November; I am servant to the Rev. Mr. Butler; I did not see them taken; they were all kept in one room, in the room of Elizabeth Vickary ; some were on the bed; they were not in drawers; they were in the front garret; I left them safe on the Wednesday afternoon; I saw them the next day, when I missed them; I know the things. Deposes to a check apron and silk handkerchief.
The prisoner was an apprentice of mine; he ran away from me on Sunday, and was home on Tuesday following; I locked him into my room; he got up this chimney; my house is next door but one to where the prosecutrix lives; he came down my chimney with these things, and got into the room again where I had locked him up; he told me that he had something which would be of use to my wife; the first thing he shewed me was this gown; he shewed me all the things that are here produced; I sent my wife to make enquiry where these things were lost from.
I am the wife of the last witness. Deposed to the same effect.
It was from a small hand against the wall, that I discovered the robbery first.
I go out to washing. I have known the prisoner from his birth: the boy has often ran away from me.
My lord, he has sent me out a begging; I have brought him eight shillings in one day.
I am beadle of Mary-le-bone parish. I do not know that ever I saw him begging; I have seen him about the streets frequently.
I never sent the prisoner out begging.
