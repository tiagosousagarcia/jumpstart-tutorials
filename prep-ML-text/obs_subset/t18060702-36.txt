I live at No. 21, Paddington-street , the prisoner at the bar was servant to Elizabeth Gibbs , I rented the second floor of Mrs. Gibbs; in my room I had a chest of drawers, and at the corner of one of the drawers I had a box where my wife kept her trinkets, and I had bank notes to the\\ amountof twenty pounds. On the 4th of May, when my wife was put to bed I missed nine pounds out of the box; previous to the 28th I moved the remainder of my money to a writing desk in order to secure it; on the 28th, when I was at breakfast, my wife communicated to me that she had lost a great deal of wearing apparel, both of my own and hers, I immediately went to my writing desk to see if any of my bank notes were gone, I perceived there was eight or ten; I went to Marlborough-street, and took a search warrant out, Slade the officer executed the search warrant, he, myself, and the prisoner, went down stairs to search a box in the kitchen, the prisoner told us it was her box, and she gave us the key; in this box Slade the officer found two or three shawls, a petticoat, and there were some gloves and gaiters found among her clothes; there were three false keys found in her pocket, the officer tried these keys to my drawers, writing desk, and my cupboard, these three keys corresponded with those three locks; in consequence of her being found out in the theft she took a quantity of laudanum, which she said was six shillingsworth, and she said she had destroyed herself; in consequence of that I took the bottle to Mr. Lomax, he said it was laudanum, he brought another gentleman, and they gave her every assistance, he brought three drafts, she had not taken any, I told her if she would take a draft I would do every thing to save her from justice I could; they took her to Mary-le-bone infirmary, and the next day she was taken before a magistrate.
I am an officer, I produce the property; some of the articles I found in her box, these three keys I found in her pocket; with one of these keys the lady opened her drawers in my presence, and the cupboard with another key, and the smallest key opened the writing desk.
Were you present when the prisoner's box was searched.
I was, I saw all the articles found, the articles are like mine, there are no marks on them, to the best of my knowledge they are mine.
The prosecutor promised to forgive me, they had three or four different nurses, and one of them slept with me.
