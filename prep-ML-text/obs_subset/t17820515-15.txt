I was coming from the Strand; there were three women standing together; the prisoner, and two others; I asked them the way to the Black Bear; the prisoner said it would cost me two shillings for a bed there, and that I had better put another shilling to it, and sleep with her. I agreed to go with her; and, instead of taking me to the Black Bear, she took me to the British Hotel, in Shug-lane , the house of John Glover .
What age are you?
Eighteen.
In what situation of life?
A French teacher .
Who employs you in that capacity?
I am for myself; I am along with my father.
Where does your father live?
At Salisbury. I came up to town to get a clerk's place.
Are you sure the prisoner is the woman?
I am. We had a pint of wine at the Hotel; when we had drank a glass of wine apiece, she said she had a friend below, and asked if it would be agreeable to me to let her come up; I said, With all my heart. We were joking together, till at last I was to be engaged with the woman that came up. When I came to be engaged with the other woman, the prisoner said my watch would hurt the other woman; she took the watch out of my pocket, with my consent, and put it behind the sofa till I got up; when I came to get up from the sofa, my watch was gone.
Was you in liquor?
Rather, or I should not have been guilty of such a thing.
Gentlemen of the Jury, this does not in point of law amount to felony; he had intrusted his watch to her.
