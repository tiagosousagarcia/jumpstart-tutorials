I am a publican , I keep the King's Arms, Fieldgate street, Whitechapel . On the 4th of November there came the ale brewer's dray to take the empty casks from my cellar; to make room to get the empty casks away they drew this butt out of the cellar. It was about seven or eight o'clock in the evening, I was busy in the bar, I could not attend to the brewers; they went away and left it in the street. At ten o'clock I went to shut the shutters up, I saw it there. It was the the porter brewer's butt.
I am a watchman. I was in my box at two o'clock in the morning; I saw the prisoner rolling the butt; I asked him what he was going to do with it; he said he was going to take it down to the turnpike, which is almost three quarters of a mile, to see if he could find an owner to it. I secured him and the butt.
I was on duty that night; the watchman brought me the prisoner in custody; I asked him where the butt was; he said in the street. I sent him for the butt.
Is this your butt
I cannot swear to it.
