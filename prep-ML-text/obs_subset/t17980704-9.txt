I live in Compton-street: On the 3d of this month, I lost my neck-handkerchief from my neck, and my hat from my head; I had been drinking along with some of my shopmates, and got in liquor, I laid down to sleep in Barrow's-court, Oxford-road ; the watchman found the hat upon the prisoner.
About three o'clock in the morning of the 3d of July, one of my fellow watchmen said there was a man sitting sleeping by a door, and that a woman, dressed in black, had robbed him of his hat and handkerchief; I saw her going up Portman-square, and I took this hat from her apron, and the neckcloth off her neck.
This is my hat and my handkerchief, I am sure they are mine.
I am a watchman: I saw the prosecutor drunk, and the woman went up to him; I asked her what she was doing with him; she said it was her husband, that was about half past two o'clock; I desired her to take him home, and about three o'clock; I saw him lying without his hat, and without his handkerchief.
About twelve o'clock I met with that man, and he asked me to have something to drink; he said he had no money, and he gave me his handkerchief and his hat for making use of me.
