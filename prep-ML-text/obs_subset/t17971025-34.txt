I am a labourer in the India Company warehouses, and so was the prisoner: I was moving a table where a coat was lying, I accidentally put my hand upon the pockets, and felt tea in them; I informed the elder, and he desired us to watch; Harding, and I, and Vokins watched, and the prisoner came and asked who had moved his coat, we got an officer and took him into custody, Vokins, the King's officer, took him into the accompting-house, and searched him, he was a long while getting his clothes on, the place was dark, and we could not see what he was doing, but he seemed to be fumbling about his breeches.
You did not see the clothes, till you saw them upon this place?
No.
There was tea scattered upon the ground?
I cannot say, there might be.
Did he not complain that somebody had been doing something with his clothes?
No, he did not.
Did you see the clothes moved?
Yes.
Did you see any body take the tea out, and examine them?
No.
I am a King's officer; (produces the tea;) I took this tea out of the prisoner's breeches, I took him into the accompting-house, and found fourteen ounces of tea concealed in his breeches behind; the constable took him before the Alderman, I was there, and he said it was his first offence, and therefore hoped they would be merciful to him.
Was nothing said to induce him to say so?
I believe not, I was not close by him at the time.
I am assistant elder of the East-India Company's Warehouses; this is the fort of tea that is in the warehouses.
I found the tea in my pocket.
