I am a ploughman ; the prisoner is a stranger to me; I live along with John Kidney , at Harrow-hill ; I lost a pair of breeches out of a corn-bin, in the stable; I missed them on Monday morning, the 23d of December, about seven o'clock, and the prisoner was taken on Christmas day; I saw them again, at a place called Wembly; they were left at a farm-house there, by the prisoner; I saw them shot out of a sack on to the Green; they were left there after the prisoner was taken, and was carried next day before the Justice.
I am a labouring man; I took the prisoner with the things on his back, I never saw him before; the prisoner is the man; I took him on Sunday evening the 22d of December, about eleven o'clock, about two miles and a half from Harrow, about a quarter of a mile from Mr. Kidney's; I was in search after a mare that I had lost, and overtook him, I suspected him, and stopped him; he had a sack upon his back, containing a quantity of chain and old iron, and these breeches; I took them to Wembly green, to a farm-house there, and turned them out; I have had them in my possession ever since. (Produces them; they were deposed to by Fletcher.)
I picked them up in the middle of the road as I came along.
