I was looking out of window; and I had put these things at the other end of the room on two stools; on the 15th of June, between nine and ten in the morning they had been washed; they were in a bundle; when I came from the window I missed my things; I had not been many minutes looking out I went to the room door and saw the prisoner on the garret stairs; I went up to him; some of the things were on the garret stairs, and the gown was put at top, and not seeing the gown I desired him to pull the gown out of his pocket; he seemed very much frightened as well as myself; I sent for a constable; and he was committed.
On the 15th of June, I took charge of this man, he was standing on the stairs the bottom part of the house; these things were put in my possession in the presence of the prisoner, they have been in my possession ever since.
On the 15th of June I heard the cry of stop thief, between nine and ten in the morning; I saw this man come out of the house; I pursued and brought him back, he had no hat on.
I went there to see an acquaintance; these things lay on the stairs.
