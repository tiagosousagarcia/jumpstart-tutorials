On the 2d of June, I lost my handkerchief out of my pocket in the Old-Bailey ; there was a crowd of people, and a lady going into a coach, I was looking at the lady, and missed my handkerchief; I turned round and saw the prisoner with his back towards me, going away, and the corner of my handkerchief hanging out of his pocket; I immediately secured him.
I picked up the handkerchief, I did not take it out of his pocket.
