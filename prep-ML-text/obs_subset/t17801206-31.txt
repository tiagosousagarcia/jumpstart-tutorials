On last Saturday about four o'clock, while I was walking in Gracechurch-street , I observed the prisoner walked on my left side; he went round to my right and picked my handkerchief out of my pocket. I immediately seised him, and he dropped the handkerchief; I went to pick it up and he ran away. I pursued him and cried stop thief! he was not out of my sight till he was taken.
I heard the cry of stop thief! I stopped the prisoner and Mr. Haines came up and delivered me the handkerchief.
I never had the handkerchief.
