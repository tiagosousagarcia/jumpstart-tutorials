I hired the prisoner as a servant of all work on Thursday the 12th of October, she came to be hired in the morning about ten o'clock; she told me a story of her distress, that she came from Essex; that it would put her to great inconvenience and expence to send her back again; upon this representation I took her without a character; she staid with me till dinner was over; after dinner she took the tankard and eight spoons which had been used at dinner into the wash-house to clean; having done so she found some opportunity of slipping out of the house and left her bonnet behind; I immediately missed the tankard and the spoons; on Friday, which was the next day, one Henley, a pawnbroker, brought home five of the spoons.
I am a pawnbroker; these five spoons (producing them,) were pawned in the name of Mary Carpenter , on the 12th of October, but I was not present at the time; on the 20th, after I had found who the spoons belonged to, and carried them home, the prisoner came for half a guinea more upon the spoons; she described them to be the spoons pledged at such a time in the name of Mary Carpenter ; I followed her and had her secured; she said if she was brought to my house she would confess the whole; she was prevailed upon to confess by my telling her that if she told the whole truth, it was likely the court would be more favourable to her.
You must not give in evidence any thing she said after such a promise as that being made to her.
I leave myself to the mercy of the court; I am seven months gone with child.
