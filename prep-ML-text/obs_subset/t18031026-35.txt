- I live in Tavistock-place ; I am the wife of Joseph Clarke; I reside with my mother; the prisoner came to live with me as footman in May last: On the 4th of June, to the best of my recollection, I gave the prisoner two one-pound Bank-notes to pay what he had borrowed in the neighbourhood of Mr. George Colemer, an oilman; it was borrowed for want of change; the oilman afterwards called with his bill, and charged the two pounds again; I called the prisoner, and he denied ever having seen the notes; there was nobody in the room but himself and me when I gave them to him; I gave them to him in the room, just as he was going to hand me into the carriage; he was not going behind the carriage; I am quite sure he saw the notes, and I gave him directions to take them to the oilman; he did not take them up while I was in the room.
I am an oilman, in Little Guilford-street; the prisoner came to me on the 1st of June, and asked for change of a ten-pound note; I could not, and I lent him two pounds; the prisoner never afterwards came to pay it.
I never saw the notes, now did I hear my mistress say any thing about them.
