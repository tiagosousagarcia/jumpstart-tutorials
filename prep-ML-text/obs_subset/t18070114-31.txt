Was the prisoner your servant on the 4th of November last.
She was. On going to bed that night I left my waistcoat on a chair by the side of the bed, in the pocket of which was a five pound bank note, No. 1650. dated 6th of February last; on the 5th I looked in the waistcoat pocket, it was gone. On the 29th of December, when Summers searched her, she dropped a purse from her side, containing four pounds thirteen shillings.
Did you accuse her of having stolen a five pound note.
I did.
I am a porkman in Bishopsgate street. The prisoner came to my house on the 30th of September, and asked me for change of a five pound note; I gave her change all in cash. I paid it to Mr. Grove, I had no other five pound note at the time.
You are a butcher residing in Bishopsgate street, do you remember receiv- any money from the last witness in notes.
I received about thirteen pounds, but what number I cannot say. I pay all my cash to Messrs. Barclay and Co.
The notes that you received from the last witness who did you pay them to.
I do not know, most likely I sent it to the banker's.
Do not you keep a banker's book.
I do, but their own book would give a better account than mine; mine is not here.
No, your own book will give as good an account, which is the receipt for the money.
