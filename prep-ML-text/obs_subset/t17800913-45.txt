On the 31st of July I saw the prisoner come out of my master's shop, who is a salesman in Rosemary-lane , between one and two o'clock. I followed her; I stopped her and found she had the things mentioned in the indictment (repeating them) in her apron; when I stopped her I asked her if she had any thing to sell? She pulled out a silver mug, and then a silver milk pot; I stopped the plate, and took her to Justice Sherwood's office. He took the plate and said he would advertise it. I am sure these things are my master's property. She said she bought the plate of a Jew; she did not deny taking these things.
I had been tried three years ago, and was ordered to be confined in Bridewell for three years, but was released by the rioters. A person gave me these things to sell.
When she was before the justice she was asked where she got these things? She said, I might find it out, and she was committed at first by the name of find it out.
