I am the wife of John Maudsley , I live in Panyer-alley, Newgate-street , my husband is a silk-dyer : On Monday, the 1st of August, I lost a gown, the prisoner lodged with me about four years ago; about three or four days after, I missed the gown, I went to the prisoner, and asked her if she had seen the gown, and she said, she did not know any thing of it; on the 11th of August, she was taken up for another offence, and when she was searched, the duplicate of my gown was found upon her, I saw it at the pawnbroker's.
I am a constable, I apprehended the prisoner on Thursday the 11th of August, in Newgate-street; I searched her, and found thirty-four or thirty-five duplicates upon her, one of them relates to this gown, (produces it;) Mrs. Maudsley was with me at the time, we found the gown at the pawnbroker's.
I went to the pawnbroker's, in Aldersgate-street, and saw the gown, which I knew to be mine, it is darned in the tail.
Was the gown shewn you upon the production of that duplicate?
Yes.
A man desired me to pledge the gown for him, for eleven shillings, which I did, in the name of Jones, and he presented me with the ticket and sixpence.
