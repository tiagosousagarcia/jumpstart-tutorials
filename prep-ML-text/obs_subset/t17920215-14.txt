I lost some lead within a week; I have lost a great deal.
The 8th day of this month, it was Wednesday was se'nnight, the dust came in upon the beasts; I looked up, and saw the lead was taken off; then I got up, and missed it.
I am patrol of St. Giles's: on Thursday the 9th instant, my partner, John Brown , and I were standing in Tottenham-court; we saw the prisoner; he crossed the way, and we thought he had something about him that was stolen; we followed him to an old-iron shop; he put down a bag, in which there was lead; I searched him, and found more lead in his pocket; I delivered the lead to Brown.
I received this lead from O'Donnel; I tried it, and fitted it; I returned the same lead to O'Donnel.
I cannot say that this is my lead; I have lost a large quantity.
I have compared it to the place; I saw the patrol do it; this lead will cover a part of the place; every part matched; Brown and I fitted it on; the nail-holes matched.
I carried the lead to the premises; it fitted as far as it went.
I found the lead in a bag.
