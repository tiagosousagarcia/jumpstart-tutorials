I live in Holborn : I deal in pictures, and all kind of curiosities ; I can only prove the property.
I keep an oil-shop in High-Holborn, nearly opposite Mr. Norborn's: I saw the prisoner at the bar take a picture from his door, on the 7th of April, about a quarter past two in the afternoon; I immediately followed him, and took it from him; I delivered him up at Mr. Norborn's shop.
This is my picture.
The picture that I took was not above half the size of that; I have got a wife and two children without a bit of bread for them, and I did not know what to do; I have but one hand. GUILTY .
