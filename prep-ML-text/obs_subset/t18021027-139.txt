I am a chairstuffer , in Long-alley, Moorfields ; I lost a set of bed-furniture on the 12th of October.
On Tuesday, the 12th of August, about twelve at noon, in company with Reed, I saw the prisoner about the foot of London-bridge, with a set of bed-furniture, and thinking he did not come honestly by it, I stopped him, and asked him where he brought it from, and he said from his master's, in Fleet-market; Sapwell received information that some furniture was stolen from the prosecutor, and we went to him.
I leave it entirely to the mercy of the Court.
