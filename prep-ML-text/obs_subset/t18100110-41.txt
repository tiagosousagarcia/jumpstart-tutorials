I am a leather seller , 63, Chiswell-street , my partner's name is Samuel Savage . A few days previous to the 29th of December, I looked out seventy skins for an order, these skins being of a bad colour, I directed them to be brimstoned, to make them of equal colour, pale. On the 29th in the afternoon, I saw them all smooth on a horse. A few hours afterwards, they appeared very much tumbled, and one was thrown into the yard and dirtied; I caused them to be brought in the warehouse, and counted, there was two gone. Our foreman went to Worship-street, and brought Armstrong and Vickrey. They searched, and found this skin in the prisoner's breeches, and the other skin was found in the workshop.
I am foreman to Samuel and Richard Savage . The seventy skins I was with Mr. Savage, looking them out. I took them out of the stove, and counted them on the horse, and on Friday I counted them three times over, there were no more than sixty-eight, instead of seventy; I went to Worship-street, brought Mr. Armstrong and Vickery with me, they waited till the men left work, and when they came down they were searched, and on the prisoner, one skin was found.
I went to this gentleman's house, after the men came down, Vickrey and I were searching, in one minute, Vickrey called me, I received this skin from him, it was taken out of the prisoner's breeches; I have had it ever since.
You were with Armstrong.
Yes, while I was searching another man, I saw the prisoner very uneasy, and his breeches were unbuttoned; I put my hand in, and took that skin out. He said, he could not tell how it came there.
