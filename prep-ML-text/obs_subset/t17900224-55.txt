I am partner with Sarah Brown : we are grocer s. On the 22d of January last, I was in the parlour, behind the shop, on hearing a noise I opened the door, and turning round, saw three boys in the shop; I saw the prisoner behind the counter in the act of reaching over to the two boy s that were before the counter; I laid hold of the prisoner; the other two boys made off; and I missed half a guinea from the till; the till was unlocked; I asked the prisoner if he took it out; he was much agitated, and said, the other boys bid me; I led him round the counter, to the door; at that instant the Reverend Dr. Martin came by, and assisted me; the boy confessed there were twelve in a gang: I am sure his confession was through fear; I never promised or threatened him. I wish to recommend him to mercy. He said, he had no friends.
How old is the prisoner?
Turned of nine.
