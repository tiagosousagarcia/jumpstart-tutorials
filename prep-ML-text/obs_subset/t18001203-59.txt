My husband is a seafaring man and a carpenter: Between seven and eight o'clock in the evening, on last Wednesday, at the White Hart, in Parson's-street , I lost a clock; I happened to meet with a Mrs. Coggin, an acquaintance, and we were both hungry, and we bought half-a-pound of pork-chops, and went in to broil them; I put my cloak on the settle next to the window; when I got up, I turned myself round, and the cloak was gone; who took it, I cannot tell.
I was sitting in the White Hart, having a pint of beer; these two women came in with a steak; Mrs. Cathery hung her cloak on the settle, and Mrs. Coggin hung her's there also; soon afterwards, a fidler came in, and I saw the prisoner shove the cloaks through the window to somebody; I am sure I saw the prisoner take the cloaks.
(To Cathery). Do you know any thing of this person?
I don't know any thing about the man.
I was coming from work that night; I went in to get a pint of beer, and there was a fiddler came in, and these two women, and some sailors began dancing, and during the time they were dancing, the cloaks were taken out of the house; they sent immediately for the officer, and gave charge of me; I am seafaring man; I have no witnesses. GUILTY , aged 33. - Confined six months in the House of Correction , and fined 1s .
