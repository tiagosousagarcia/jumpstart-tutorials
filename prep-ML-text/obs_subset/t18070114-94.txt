I live in Cranbourn passage , I am a linen draper . On the 27th of December, about three o'clock, from information I followed the prisoner, I brought her back and found the print on her, it was under her cloak, it was placed at the door on a chair, I had seen it myself there at ten in the morning.
On the 27th of December, between three and four o'clock, I was going home with my two children, I saw this woman and another standing at this gentleman's shop looking at the cotton. I went about five or six yards off, I looked, I perceived the prisoner taking the cotton from the chair, and then she put it under her left arm, she walked round the corner, and I gave information immediately to Mr. Chinnery; he pursued her and brought her back. I saw the cotton taken from her.
She tells false; I saw the cotton lay at the door, and I picked it up.
