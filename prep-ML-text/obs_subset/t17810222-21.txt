I am a shopman to Mr. Crofton. On the 23d of last month, at about half past seven in the evening, the shop was shut in and I was behind the counter at the farther end of it; the shutters belonging to the window were not put up; there was a large pile of flannels; I saw the prisoner inside the door; the door was just too, but I believe the latch was not shut. I did not see him push open the door nor come into the shop, but saw him have his hand upon the stockings very plain.
How could he get in without your seeing him?
There were about six rolls of flannel upon the end of the counter; they were so high as to conceal him; and as soon as I saw him he had hold of the stockings. I sprang along the shop and asked what he was at; he made no answer but attempted to get out at the door; but before he got out of the shop I laid hold of his coat, and in pulling him very strongly it occasioned his falling.
Did you reach over the counter or go round?
I was round the counter when I first saw him.
What became of the stockings?
He pulled them off that pile; there were about three dozen in each pile upon the counter; the counter was exceeding full. He only pulled them off the pile, but did not get them off the counter.
How far did he move them?
About a quarter of a yard.
What did he say for himself when you pulled him down?
He did not speak at all; I called for assistance and our shopman who was sweeping the door came up and helped to secure him. He said he was a plaisterer and lived in Half-moon alley, Aldersgate-street.
Did he say what he was going to do with the stockings, or how he came there?
He did not.
Was I the person who entered the shop?
I seised him in the shop, and he never was out of my custody.
As I was coming by, having been at my brother's in the Minories, this man laid hold of me as a man had ran by; I never was in the shop.
