I live at Fulham , I keep a candle shop . On the 18th of November in the morning I was eating my breakfest, when Butcher came into the shop and asked for some sugar; my niece went into the shop and served him; he asked for some pepper; she turned back to get the pepper, and he took the pound of candles off the rails.
Did you see him
My niece saw him. As soon as he was gone, she called out to me the old man has got another pound of candles; I followed him to his lodgings; I found him, I took him by the collar, desired him to deliver up the candles; he told me if I would not hurt him he would pay me for them, I told him as he had robbed me so many times before I would detain him. I sent for a constable and delivered him up, and the candles.
I am the niece of the last witness. On Friday morning the prisoner came in for half a pound of sugar, he asked for some pepper; I turned to get the pepper I saw him take the pound of candles, I was very much frightened, I could not speak; he asked what I coloured for; I told him I did not know, as soon as he went out of the shop I told my uncle that this old man had taken another pound of candles.
I went of errands for Nancy Wilcox ; I used to fetch corn and hay for her; I asked this young woman for a pound of butter, half a pound of sugar, and a pennyworth of pepper; I never made any mistake in the world before. When the prosecutor came to me, I said the candles will be paid for.
