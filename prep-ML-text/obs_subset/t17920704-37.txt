I am servant to Charles Cleave ; I heard that a man had taken a coat, and was in the potatoe warehouse; I went, and brought him to my master; and he told me to take him to Sir Laurence Cox ; the coat hung on the outside of the door.
I saw a man take the coat off the place, and go into the potatoe shop, but I was thirty yards off, and cannot swear to the prisoner.
