I live in Globe-fields, Bethnal-green : On the 25th of October, at half past five in the morning, I was getting up, I heard somebody in my grounds; I afterwards let in my servant, and I saw that somebody had been over the fence into the grounds; I missed a new spade, a shovel, and a new basket; I found she footstep of some person where they had got over, and I found this bill close to where he had go over, (produces it) ; I saw the property the same night at Worship-street,
I went to work and missed the tools; the shovel was mine: Between nine and then o'clock the same day, I met the prisoner in Baker's-row, with a basket on his head, and a spade and shovel under his left arm; I passed him, and saw my own initial upon the shovel that I had wrote my self; I then examined the spade, and knew it by a river that I had put in myself; I dollowed him to Quaker-street, and collared him; I gave him in charge to Mr. Hart; he is not here.
How far is that from Mr. Shepherd's?
Rather better than a mile.
