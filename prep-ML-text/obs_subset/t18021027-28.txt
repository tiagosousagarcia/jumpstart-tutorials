On the 9th of October, I lodged at the Hampshire-hog, in Peartree-street, Goswell-street ; I came home about four o'clock, my hat was very wet, and I hung it upon the poker to dry, by the grate; I was sitting in one of the boxes, the landlord of the house was with me; in about a quarter of an hour I missed my hat; the prisoner had been in the tap-room after I hung it up, and was there then; I borrowed Mr. Salmon's hat, who keeps the house, and went out and bought another; when I came back, Mrs. Salmon gave me information, in consequence of which, we waited till the prisoner got up to go away, and then Mrs. Salmon said, that is the man that has got your hat; I immediately took my hat from under the prisoner's coat, behind him.
I saw Kingsbury's hat upon the poker; I took it off, and laid it on the tap-room table; I saw no more of it; the prisoner was in the tap-room; Kingsbury went out to buy another, and while he was gone, I thought I saw the hat under the slap of the prisoner's coat, as he sat on the form; I told Kingsbury of it, and saw him take it from behind his back, under his coat.
I have served the landlord of that house, with corn and coals, for some years; I went to this house about four o'clock, and had some porter; Mrs. Kingsbury told me I had got a hat, and they took it from me; but whether it was put there as a trick or not, I cannot say; I don't know how it came there.
