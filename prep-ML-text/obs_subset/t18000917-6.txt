I am an engraver : On the 13th of August, about eight o'clock in the evening, I was robbed in St. John's-street ; there were some volunteers coming past, and a great mob, when the prisoner at the bar and four or five more, hustled me, and made a snatch at my watch; the ribband, seal, and key of which he took; he was the person who snatched it; I had never seen him before I saw him do it; he then put his hand behind him, and gave it to one of his companions; I am positively sure he is the person; I endeavoured to lay hold of him, and another struck me; he was taken on Snow-hill about ten minutes after in consequence of pursuit; I endeavoured to get a constable, but could not; I saw him facing the Compter before he got to Snow-hill.
You had never seen the person before?
Not to my knowledge.
The street was pretty full of people?
Yes.
You have no other witness but yourself?
No.
Do you know that you are prosecuting this man for an offence which will affect his life?
I hope not.
But you are though - do you know that there is a reward of forty pounds if he is convicted, of which you will have the whole?
No.
You would not take it, perhaps?
I would not.
And knowing that, will you venture to swear to his person?
Yes.
I was at work for Mr. Skidmore that day till seven o'clock; I was coming down Snow-hill with the volunteers, and this gentleman laid hold of me, and said, I had robbed him.
Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am foreman to Mr. Skidmore, stovegrate maker to his Majesty's board of ordnance; the prisoner was at work for Mr. Skidmore, and worked that evening till seven o'clock; I have known him about two years, and his father ten, he has worked for Mr. Skidmore about ten months; I never heard any thing dishonest respecting him.
