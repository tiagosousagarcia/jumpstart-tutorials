On the 17th of this month, between six and seven in the evening, I was informed my door was robbed; I live in Barbican ; the things were hung at the outside of the door; I am a salesman .
On Saturday last I was in the shop, and I thought I saw the things at the door move; I came to the door directly, and a woman informed me we were robbed.
I saw a man snatch the things, and go off with them.
I am innocent.
