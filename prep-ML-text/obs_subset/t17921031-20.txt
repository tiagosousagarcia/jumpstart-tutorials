I live at No. 1, Little White Lion-street, Seven Dials : I lost the things on Monday, the 1st of October: I took the things to the prisoner to wash, on the 28th of September: on the Monday I went to her lodgings, No. 12, in Castle-street; I received them of her, and went to the shop where I work, which is in the house where she lives in, and on the same floor; there I put on a clean shirt, and under the bench I placed the shirt, breeches, and neck-cloth: I am a locksmith: I threw my foul shirt over them, to keep the dust from them; then I went out about nine o'clock in the morning; I did not return there that day; on Tuesday morning I missed the things, when I went to work: on Wednesday morning I went to the prisoner's door, and she opened it; I asked if she knew any thing of my linen; she said she knew nothing about them since she gave them to me on Monday; I enquired of my shop-mate; I had a suspicion of this woman, and enquired at several pawnbrokers, and at last, at Mr. Brown's, I found my shirt and neck-cloth; I have never found the breeches: I got a constable and took her up at night.
I am apprentice to Mrs. Lane, in Castle-street: the prisoner came to me in the shop, and desired me to give her John Manning 's dirty shirt and stockings; I gave them to her; she saw the clean things laying there, and said they will get dirty; she brought me a piece of old silk to lay over them, which I did; then I went down stairs.
I am servant to Mr. Brown, Long Acre: I produce a shirt and neck-cloth; I took them in of the prisoner at the bar, both in one day, though at different times; I lent one shilling on the shirt and sixpence on the neck-cloth.
I own I took the shirt and neck-cloth through distress: I meant to redeem them; he owes me more than the things were worth.
