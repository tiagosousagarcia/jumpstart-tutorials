I am a Portuguese sailor : On Friday the 11th of June, the prisoner came with milk to my house, in Black-horse-yard, East-Smithfield ; I was sitting down, leaning upon my hand, with my ring on my finger almost asleep; he took my ring off my singer, I said, give me my ring; he said, do you think I would rob you of your ring; he turned round and ran away.
I live with Mr. Manrice, pawnbroker; the prisoner pledged in a ring on the 11th of June, and said, it was his; it was since delivered to a man who bought the duplicate, Mr. Davis.
I got this duplicate from Eliezer Hiams, who had it from James Rustel .
I told it to Hiams.
