I am a shoe-maker , No. 40, Monmouth-street : My wife has had a bad state of health a long time, and the prisoner has come backwards and forwards to assist in the house; we missed a great number of things, and I suspected the prisoner, my wife went to her lodgings, and sent for me; I went and told her, unless she gave me the duplicates, I would send for an officer; I sent for an officer, and the prisoner delivered to me thirty-four duplicates.
I have been in a bad state of health, and the prisoner assisted in the house during my illness.
Did you ever give her any authority to pledge any of these articles for you or any of the family?
Never in my life.
Have you never taken these things from your husband's house and left them at her house?
Never.
The whose of these things I had been entrusted with by Mrs. Clymer; they were going to part, and I was to get her a lodging; she was to have them whenever she called for them.
I never did any thing of the kind.
Have not you and your wife been parted; and did you not advertise her in the papers?
We did part, and I advertised not to trust her during her absence; but since that we have been very good friends, and never had any words.
