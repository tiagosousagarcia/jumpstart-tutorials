After Holder was taken into custody, Jones came up; and Walter desired me to take charge of him. There was nothing found upon him.
I searched the prisoner's lodging, No. 38, Seacoal-lane: I found a very large quantity of halfpence and farthings.
After Holder was taken, Jones was brought into the public-house: I did not see Jones in company with Holder at all.
