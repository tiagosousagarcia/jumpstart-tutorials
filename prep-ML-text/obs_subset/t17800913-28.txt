My husband's name is Matthew Smith . On the 13th of July, at about twelve o'clock, I was informed a person had come out of my house with a bundle. I got several people to go after her; the prisoner was taken and brought back with the things mentioned in the indictment upon her; some of them belong to a Mrs. Vallans, the rest belong to Mrs. Blewett; I had them to wash.
As I was going along to my work I happened to meet a woman with these things; I am partly sure it is the prisoner, but I cannot swear it is her; I met her just above Harrow Stock-hill, Hempstead. The girl, who belonged to the house the linen was taken from, desired me to stop her. I did, and took her to Mr. Edwards, the constable; there I saw her searched, and the things mentioned in the indictment were found upon her; they were loose in her apron.
I am a constable. The prisoner was brought to me by the last witness with a bundle of linen in her apron; it has been in my possession ever since.
I asked her how she came to rob a labouring woman? She said, The Devil led her into the house. I asked her if she lifted up the latch? She said no, the door was open.
I found them on the road.
