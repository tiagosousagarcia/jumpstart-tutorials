I live in St. Paul's church-yard , I am a haberdasher , in partnership with Thomas Brown, and Robert Hogard ; the prisoner lived as cook about five weeks, my sister had a character with her; she had access to the place where the goods now charged were deposited, they were found in her box; she was dismissed on the 8th of June; I saw my property on that day; my partner shewed me a cloth with seven straw bonnets, two knives, snuffers, towel, and two pillow-cases, marked with my initials, all my property.
I am partner in the house; I was present at opening the box, on the 8th of June, she opened it herself; I found the specified articles, the towel was at her lodgings; she gave the direction, and I went there; I can swear to the whole.
I received the bonnets from a young woman; I bought the pillow-cases a year ago, the knives I had had some years.
