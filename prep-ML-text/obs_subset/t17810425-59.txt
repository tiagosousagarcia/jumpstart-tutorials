Upon the 6th of March, between nine and ten at night, I was going home to Little Wild-street, Lincoln's-inn-fields, from the Maze, on the other side of the water, being a little intoxicated: two men and a woman came up to me; one of the men was tall, the other short and stout; they said, Sir, you seem to be very much in liquor; which way are you going? I said I was going home to Little Wild-street; they said, you are going the wrong way, and they took me down Water-lane: there I was knocked down, and my watch taken from me. The next morning I went to the Public Office in Bow-street, and lodged a complaint, and advertised it on the Saturday following in the Gazetteer. Upon the 5th of this month I was sent for to the Office; there I saw my watch; it was stopped by the pawnbroker: I cannot swear to the prisoner.
I live at No. 9, in Heydon-street: the prisoner came to me, the morning he was apprehended, and asked me to pawn that watch; he said he wanted clothes more than money: the pawnbroker stopped it, and sent me for the prisoner; I went and fetched him: he was taken into custody, and carried before the justice: the pawnbroker has got the watch; I should not know it if I was to see it again: the prisoner had been in service; I did not know but he might have a watch or two.
I apprehended the prisoner; he told me he came from on board a ship, and bought the watch of a soldier in the fields from Deptford.
