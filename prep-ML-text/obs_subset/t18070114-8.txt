I am a servant . On the 3d of December, between the hours of eleven and twelve at night, I was carrying a child of my master's from the play; I had got about an hundred yards in Brydges street, Covent Garden .
What age was the child.
About seven years old. When a mob of people collected, and in the mob I saw the prisoner in the act of pulling my watch from my fob; I observed the prisoner drawing the watch out of my pocket.
Your master and family went to the play that night.
Yes.
You were carrying a girl in your arms, and while you were carrying this girl to the coach you found somebody take the watch from your pocket.
Yes.
What did you do then.
I collared him; I said, you rascal you have robbed me; my master called out to me to give him the child. Then I laid hold of the prisoner with both hands, I called out to the watch, to whom I gave him in charge; I saw him shift the watch from one of his hands to another; I called out there goes my watch. After stopping twenty minutes two other watchmen came and took him to the watchhouse.
You were coming out of the door into Brydges street.
Yes.
In consequence when the play was over there were a great quantity of people.
Yes.
Do you mean to say that you saw the prisoner with your watch in his hand.
I am certain of it.
Did you give that account at Bow street.
I did.
