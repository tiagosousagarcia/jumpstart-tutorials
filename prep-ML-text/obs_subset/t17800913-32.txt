I am apprentice to Messrs. Thomas Shrimpton , John Russell , and William Ewster , who are ironmonger s. On the 13th of July, between four and five in the afternoon, the prisoner came to the warehouse at a time when there was only a boy serving two customers, finding the boy had more to do than he could manage, I went into the shop. I found the prisoner at the counter; he said he wanted a halfpenny worth of tacks; the article being so trifling, and having seen him pass the door twice before, I suspected him. I served him with the tacks, and as he went out of the warehouse I saw a parcel in his pocket; I desired Mr. Lynam to follow him. He and Samuel Fowler both went out after him, and brought him back; the nails were found in the church-yard.
I am shopman to Messrs. Shrimpton and Co. I went after the prisoner; he was stopped by Fowler between thirty and forty yards from our shop. We brought him back. Fowler said he had thrown the parcel over into the church-yard. I got over the wall and found the parcel.
I overtook the prisoner; he had the parcel in his right-hand pocket. I took hold of his collar; he put his hand in his pocket and took it out, and chucked it over the wall. When we brought him back he said he had done it through distress.
I saw the parcel lying on the ground as I came out of the shop; I thought somebody else might drop it; I took it up and put it in my pocket.
