I do slop work ; make sailor's jackets and trowsers. I live at No. 28, George-yard, Whitechapel .
Do you know the prisoner at the bar?
Yes.
Did you know her before you lost your property?
Yes.
What is she?
She did flop work when she pleased.
Did she work with you?
Sometimes she did and sometimes she did not, she goes from one mistress to another when she pleases.
What do you say about the cloth cloak?
This is it.
Was she in your house or in your employment at the time you lost it?
She came into the house and asked me for a little work, the 2d of January, which was last Friday was a week, and she took my cloak away.
Where was the cloak?
It was on a table just by the door. I happened to want to go to the warehouse and looked for the cloak, and instantly missed it. I was going to the warehouse that minute, to Mr. Darby's, in Gracechurch-street; I missed the cloak as soon as she was gone out of the room. I went after her instantly and catched her with it in her apron; I pulled her apron on one side and see my cloak, and I said, what a wicked hussey you are to take my cloak when you know how hard I work for my living, and she said it was none of my cloak, she had borrowed it. She knows it is my cloak very well, and I know it very well; the lining is tore.
She agreed to make it up with the officer for two shillings.
I told her I would not hurt her if I could any way help it; if I could any way get her off when I went before the justice, I would; and when I went before the justice I said, as long as I have got my cloak again, if you think proper, she may go about her business.
I borrowed the cloak of Mrs. Nash.
It is not true, indeed it is not.
