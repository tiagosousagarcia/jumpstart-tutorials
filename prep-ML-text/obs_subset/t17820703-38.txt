I am the wife of Edward Rowland . We lodge in the dwelling-house of James Perry , No. 13, Maiden-Lane, Covent-Garden : on the 21st of June, I lost the things mentioned in the indictment; (repeating them) they were in my room. I take in washing; some of them were folded for ironing.
What time of the day did you lose them?
Between two and three o'clock; I was in the room at the time: I was tired, and lay down to rest me about half an hour. In the mean time, the things were stolen; part of them were found by the constable the next day .
You don't know the prisoner at all?
No.
On the 22d of last month, as I was going up the King's Road, I saw the prisoner with two bundles. I followed her into a public-house, and asked her, where she got those things; she said, they were her own, that she had just fetched them out of pawn. I suspected they were not, and took her to Bow-street. I sent for the prosecutrix, and she said they were her property.
The petticoat and counterpane are my own.
