I look after cows ; the prisoner lodged in my house, the corner of Hog's-alley, Liquorpond-street, Gray's-inn-lane ; the property was found at the pawnbroker's.
Last Wednesday was a week, I went in to the country; I returned on the Saturday following, and on the Sunday I missed the things; the prisoner had left the house on the Friday, there were five weeks rent due; the property was found at the pawnbroker's.
I am servant to a pawnbroker, (produces a gown, a coat, and a red cloak;) they were brought to me by the prisoner at the bar; the cloak on the 8th of September, and the coat and the gown on the 12th of September; I know her person perfectly well; we detained her at our shop. (The property was deposed to by Mr. Sayer.)
I am a constable; I took the prisoner to the Compter, and searched her, I found a pocket-book, with twenty-two duplicates upon her.
My husband went away and left me in great distress, I was in hopes of being able to replace it.
