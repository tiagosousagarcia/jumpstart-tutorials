I live with Mr. Crook, No. 9, Nottingham plac e. On the 26th of October the prisoner was sent to paint a small room over the stable by my master's order. I lost the property off the corn bin in the hay loft, all adjoining. I had just come there to live.
What did you lose
A pair of silver buckles and a clothes brush; I saw them there in the morning, and I missed them about seven o'clock in the evening of the same day. The prisoner was the only person employed to paint the room.
Did you leave him in the room when you went out
Yes; I was in my stable when he went out; I saw him go out.
How long might he be up stairs
About a couple of hours; it is only a small place.
I am a constable; I apprehended the prisoner in Paddington street; I searched him; I found the buckles in his right hand breeches pocket. After I had got the things in my hand, the prisoner said he meaned to take them back again, if he had the opportunity.
I had the buckles in my possession four days. I was painting this room, and I saw these buckles in charge on the top of a little bulk among some old harness and rubbish in the lost; I took them, conceiving them to be of no value. On the Tuesday night I took them; on the Wednesday night I found them to be silver. I immediately related what I had done, and having to finish the job in the coachman's room, I wrapt them in paper in order to retain them till I went again.
They were laying on the top of the bin, not among any rubbish.
Was the room finished
It was finished for a time.
Was he to return again
That I do not know.
