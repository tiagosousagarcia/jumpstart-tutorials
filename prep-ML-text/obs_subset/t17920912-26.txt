I am servant to Mr. Robinson, in Old Broad Street ; I fastened the doors and windows, on Tuesday the 8th of May; we have three female servants; this was on Tuesday night; I always went round to see all safe; I was the last who went to bed; our bed time is generally a little before eleven; between five and six the next morning I was alarmed by the ringing of the bell; I went down stairs, and discovered a quantity of linen laying about the passage; the street door was half way open, and two watchmen standing on the steps at the door; I alarmed the house, and then went into the kitchen, and found the door forced open; at the bottom of the stairs, the window of the kitchen was forced open; I think they got in at the window, it was forced open, the sash was shoved down, and an arm must have been put down the light-hole cut in the shutter, and by that means the bar was taken down; I saw a great quantity of things in the passage; these things had been part in my master's room, and part in the parlour; it was light a considerable time before I came down.
The plate is worth between two and three hundred pounds; I offered one hundred pounds rewards.
The night of this robbery, all the plate was in my pantry, which is a little way from the kitchen.
I live with John Monk; I lived with him at the time of the robbery; I knew Waine before Easter; John Monk came home between nine and ten in evening, very much disguised in liquor, and laid down on the bed; this was on Tuesday, the 7th of May; between ten and eleven Percival came up stairs, and then about eleven Waine came; upon Waine's coming, Percival said to Monk, come Jack, will you go he was unwilling to go, and said, I think it will do another night; Percival said the family all went out of town this afternoon, I saw them in their carriage; I was in bed with another woman, of the name of Deacon; there was an iron crow and a rook, in a Plant under the bed, which they pulled out, then they all went out; this was about 11 or 12; I heard them say they were going to do some place in Broad Street; Monk went out, and left his Money with me, he returned between six and seven, and brought home some new guineas, and pieces of silver, that looked as though they had been hoarded; between ten and eleven Waine came up stairs, and a man came up stairs with a handbill, and said, see what a capital robbery has been done in Broad Street, upon which all our countenances changed; then Monk went upon the stair case, and pulled out more of the silver, some crowns, and half crowns, and shillings from his pocket when the man went; Monk sold the silver, which was twenty seven shillings, for a guinea; Waine came frequently to our lodgings; we removed from those furnished lodgings; I was not before Mr. Spiller.
On Tuesday night, Robert Percival came to Monk's lodgings; I live with him and Maria Upwell ; about twelve at night Waine came: Waine asked Monk, if he would go, and Monk said, another night will do as well; Percival said, all the family are gone out of town, I saw them in a coach; then they all went out, and Monk returned between five and six in the morning; Waine came between ten and eleven o'clock, and presently a man came up with a handbill; afterwards Monk said, what shall I do with my silver? and Waine said, mine is safe, and I will give you a guinea for it, upon which he did; when they went to commit the robbery, Waine had a cane under his coat, and said he would knock down the first who touched him; (a thick cane about eighteen inches long produced) that is the cane; there is a place underneath the head of the bed, where they used to put their tools; William Waine took a Rook from under the head of the bed, in order to do which he removed the bed and got it out; I have lived with Monk and Upwell two months; I knew Monk to be a common thief; I have left them about four months; I live now at Shoreditch, at a chandler shop, as a servant; I knew Waine only while I was there; these people went out once or twice a week upon jobs of this sort.
I saw the cane in the closet, I had it of my fellow servant John, before six in the morning; there was no such cane in the coset overnight.
I have for some years past supported myself by thieving; Waine and Percival assisted me to rob the house of Mr. Robinson; I went home on Tuesday night, the 7th of May, and laid down on the bed, I was in liquor; Percival came to me and and told me he knew of a place where there was a great deal of plate, in a back parlour, that a plasterer had told him of it, and said he knew all about it; I said I would rather defer it, and he said that would be the best night, as the family were out of town; he said it was of great consequence, and we all agreed to go; and Percival said then we shall all get a great deal of money; the tools we used were under a board at the head of the bedstead; Upwell and Deacon were in bed, I desired them to get out, and Waine said no, we will give you a ride, the bed was removed, and we took out a large iron crow; I asked him if he had a light, he said yes, he had phosphorus; Waine had a short piece of cane, which he said was to knock down the watchmen, if they were to molest him; it was a plain piece; he said he got that cane at a warehouse in Cheapside, by way of sample, and if it would fetch any thing, he could get plenty more; we then went to Broad Street, and Waine having the crow, got over the area rails, and worked some time, then he called us over, and said, I have opened the window, then we got over, and he opened the kitchen door, and let us in; Waine prepared a light; there were several things in the kitchen; then we went up to the back parlour, we opened a box, and found some plated candlesticks, by cutting the bottoms; we left that, and went to a desk, and Waine broke open the desk, and we found a ring in a black case, a watch with a dark coloured case and a gold inside case; then we went to another desk, and got some pieces of old money; we found a great deal of plate; we got into the house about half past twelve, and staid till past five; we looked out of the parlour window and saw the watchmen, and staid till they were gone off their beat; then we went to Broker's Row, and I met Charles Clarke ; there was myself, Waine, and Percival, and I asked him how he did, this may be about a quarter of a mile from the house, I had then a waiter under my arm, Waine had a coffee pot, and several articles tied in a bird's-eye handkerchief; then we went to Bunhill Row; we all had plate tied up in each parcel, in a bird's-eye handkerchief; then we went to Cowheel-Alley, and saw some people at work; we were to give the people something to let us conceal the property, till we could find a purchaser; Waine sent for Mrs. Paget, and we sold the plate at 4 s. per ounce; my share for the plate was twenty guineas; we sold the plated basket and watch for four guineas; Percival was not to have any share in the rings; Waine and I kept them for ourselves; Waine came about twelve next day, Percival was there, and an acquaintance called upon me, and shewed me a handbill of the robbery, and I was afraid to keep the silver coin, as they appeared to be hoards; Percival was not to have any share of the silver; I sold the silver to Waine 27 s. (for a guinea;) he lived in Bell-alley, Golden-lane; and as he kept a pig in his cellar, he could bury it better than I could; I was apprehended for this robbery, but there was a charge of another robbery; I was tried for robbing my master, but I was acquitted; I have always frequented public houses of ill fame; I have seen Clarke to-day, he sat in the same box over the way, and I saw him after the robbery, and I said to Clarke, how do you do?
I am a bookbinder, in Queen's-square, Moorfields; I am not acquainted with the prisoner; on Wednesday morning, 9th of May, about a quarter past five, I met Waine, Percival, and Monk, in Moorfields, they were all three carrying bundles, two of them had silk handkerchiefs of a dark colour, one of a paler colour, it appeared to be an old handkerchief, they were different patterns; Waine and Percival's handkerchiefs appeared a-like, Monk's was inferior in quality, and paler in colour, Monk's did not quite cover the contents, and it appeared to me to be of white metal, silver, or something else, I passed them very quick, and Monk nodded; I believe I was sent for to the office, and I picked Waine out; I have no doubt of his being the person; there were between twenty or thirty in the office, but he was along with four others; I know none of them, only by sight; I have seen Waine with him at the public-house; I was set to watch a door in Fore-street, he was in the lottery, I was put there and ordered to let in none but those I knew, I know there is a reward of 100 l. and I expect to be paid a part of it only, by way of recompence for loss of time; when I met them I did not hear them speak to me.
I am constable of Enfield; the first week in July, I went in pursuit of the prisoner, and I saw him going across the road at Ponder's-end towards Enfield, he turned round and saw Lisle, the constable, and then he set off running, he jumped over a gate into a field, and I told two men to go over, and there he was found hid.
I am a constable at Ponder's-end; on Wednesday, early in July, I went after Waine at Ponder's-end, he was walking across the road, I walked after him, and as soon as he saw me, he set off running, and he leaped over a gate, and I went after him; he jumped over a hedge, and I after him; the place he was taken in was a field in Bedwell; I had known him seven or eight days.
I took the prisoner at Ponder's-end, in the ditch.
I leave it to my counsel.
