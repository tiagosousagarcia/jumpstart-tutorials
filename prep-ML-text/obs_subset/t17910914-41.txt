I am the parish clerk of Great Shelford, Cambridgeshire; I have my register books here.
Do you know the prisoner?
Right well.
Do you know
Right well, I knew her before she married her first husband, I was present at the marriage ceremony of her wish the prisoner, she had four children by him, one is alive, and three are dead; he left her about four years ago, at this present time she is alive and well.
I was a child when this happened, not above fifteen or sixteen years old.
Court to Scott. Do you know how old he was?
I do not know, I suppose him him about twenty or twenty-one when he married her; she was in tolerable good circumstances, she kept a shop .
Had not she four children, and beholden to the parish; I wonder how that can be good circumstances.
Court to Scott. How was he married?
By banns.
I became first acquainted with the prisoner about four years ago; I was servant to Mr. Thomas Scofield ; the prisoner was a single man, and said, he never was in a church till he went with me. We were married on the 28th of May, 1788. We lived together till this about these ten weeks past. I have had two children by him; but one has since died for want. When he went, he said, I should never set sight of him again, as he was going to have another wife. He left me very distressed; I had not above a shilling or two in my pocket. He came, and took the sheets off the bed, and two silver spoons out of my pocket. I walked about afterwards for three weeks or a month, to trace out, if I could find out, where he was.
That good woman knows very well, that I was very much distressed, and I thought to go to sea; and as soon as I got a little money, to come home to her.
What have you to say to the charge?
I liked the girl very well, and did not like the first; and I thought no crime in it.
