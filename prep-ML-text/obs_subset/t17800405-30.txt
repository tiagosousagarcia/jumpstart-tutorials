I am a constable. On the 29th of January, I had a warrant from Mr. Joseph Bolden to take the prisoner. He was gone off, and I could not meet with him till the 19th of March, then I took him at a publick-house in Acton; I told him I had a warrant against him for robbing Mr. Bolden of some trusses of clover hay; he said, I did do it to my sorrow, let me drink my beer and I will go along with you. I took him to my house; I sent to Mr. Bolden to let him know I had taken the prisoner. I then asked the prisoner what he had robbed his master of, and bid him tell me the truth; he said he would cut his arm off rather than not tell the truth. He said, He had robbed him of ten trusses of hay, three of them of the best clover, two trusses of barley straw, and a peck and a half of beans. He said he sold them to George Rawlins , who keeps a publick-house opposite Mr. Bolden's farm, for nine-pence a truss; he said he had some of it in money and some in liquor.
You kept him at your house till the 30th I believe?
Yes.
What time did he make this confession?
I took him about eleven o'clock; I believe this was between twelve and one.
Did not you say something to induce him to make this confession?
Yes, I told him it would be better for him in the other part of the other world.
Did you promise him he should not be prosecuted if he confessed?
No; I said it would be better for him when he departs this life.
I am a farmer in the Brentford road. On the 28th of January I lost the trusses of hay mentioned in the indictment. George Rawlins , on whose premisses they were found, brought them back the next morning, in consequence of some conversation which had passed between him and the prisoner the morning the hay was missing.
I know nothing of it.
