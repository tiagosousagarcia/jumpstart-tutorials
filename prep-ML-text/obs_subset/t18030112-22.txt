- I am coachman to the York and Edinburgh Mail: On Friday, the 7th of January, about six o'clock in the morning, I left my coat in the care of the horse-keeper , at the Bull and Mouth, Joseph Lumley .
I am horse-keeper at the Bull and Mouth: Barrett left a great coat with me on the 7th of January, in the morning; I hung it up to dry; there was a jacket of mine taken from the same stable; here is a witness that stopped him.
I am a porter at the Bull and Mouth; on the 7th of January I saw the prisoner taking a great coat and a jacket out of the yard; I saw him come out of the stable; I followed him to the gate; I asked the man that keeps the gate if he knew any thing of him, and he dropped both the articles immediately; I followed him a-cross Bull and Mouth street, laid hold of him, and brought him into the yard; I never lost sight of him; I took him to the book-keeper, and he charged a constable with him and the things.(The constable produced the property, which was identified by Barrett and Lumley.)
I have nothing to say; I leave it to the mercy of your Lordship.
