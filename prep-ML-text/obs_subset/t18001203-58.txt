- I am a pavier's labourer : On the 14th of November, I went out to clean the gutter of the house that I rent of Mr. Green, No. 1, Grotto-place, near Parrington-street ; I missed some lead, and I came in and mentioned it to a man that lodged with me in the front room, who told me, there was a man taken up, and sent to the watch-house, with some lead; I went to the watch-house, and made a report I had lost some lead, and Belts, the officer, went and sitted it in my absence; it was fastened with a hold-fast, and it was cut.
I am a watchman: About three o'clock in the morning, I met the prisoner at the bar with a load of lead on his shoulder; I asked him what he had got; he said, nothing but a stick; I looked, and I saw something, and I collared him; I then sprung my rattle, and he threw the lead down, and wanted to get off; I threatened to knock him down if he offered to go; then a watchman came up to my assistance, and we took him and the lead to the watch-house; that is all I know about it.
I belong to Marybone watch-house: The prisoner at the bar was brought in with the lead, and I went and fitted the piece to the building, and it exactly fitted.
I will take my oath I never was at the top of the house; I had been out that night watching my master's garden, and as I was coming home, I picked it up.
