I am a widow; I know nothing of the loss.
I am a breeches-maker, I saw the prisoner come out of Mrs. Weston's house, I lodged in the house; I followed her, and found her with the cloak and apron upon her; I took them from the prisoner, and gave them to Mrs. Weston, she delivered them to the officer.
I am a constable, (produces the property;) I have had them ever since, I received them from Mrs. Weston.
I received this cloak and apron from Simpson, and gave them to the officer; they are my property, I had seen them ten minutes before.
I had come three hundred miles, with three fatherless children, and buried one on the road; I was very sack and fatigued; I went into this house and sat down, and slept about half an hour; I did not know that I had the things till I saw them at my feet, when he stopped me.
