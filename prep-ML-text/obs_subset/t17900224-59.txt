I am a servant to Mr. Hanks. These deals were in his yard, in Limehouse-hole ; I saw the prisoner take them; he took them from among sixty, about five o'clock in the afternoon, on Wednesday, the 17th of this month; he was proceeding towards Limehouse church, but they being heavy, he pitched them; when I come up to him, as he was resting, and he informed me they were too heavy for him.
Were there any deals there, except your master's?
No.
I am a constable. The deals were delivered to me, and the prisoner; the deals are at the door.
A man asked me to carry these two deals to Ratcliff-cross, and I will satisfy you for it accordingly; I rested them against the wall, and this gentleman came up.
