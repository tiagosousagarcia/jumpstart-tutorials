I am a shoemaker. On the 25th of May, between one and two o'clock, I saw the prisoner go to the prosecutor's window: he leaned over, and took a piece of silk, and concealed it under his coat. He went off. I followed him. When he got upon Ludgate-hill, he ran. I cried, Stop thief! He ran across to the London coffee-house. Some people attempting to stop him, he ran across the way again. I called, Stop thief! and he dropped the silk. Some people coming along, stopped him. He was never out of my sight before he was stopped.
I am a woollen-draper, in Cock-court, Ludgate-hill. The last witness, Wood, brought back the prisoner, with a piece of silk, which was my property.
I was coming through the court. I heard somebody cry, Stop thief! I went to get out of the way, as I had a bad arm. Somebody that ran by, dropped something; and they happened to lay hold of me.
