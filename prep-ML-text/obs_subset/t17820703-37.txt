About the 18th or 19th of May, I had been to see a friend in Moorfields. Coming home, as I was going across Cable-street, the prisoner catched hold of me, and asked me, if I would go along with her. I said no. She took my hat off my head, and took my watch out of my pocket .
Did she say any thing at the time?
No.
Did she use any degree of violence to you?
No; I gave the beadle charge of her, and he took the watch from her.
Whether I was the person that was in the room with him, or that brought him into the room?
I never was in any room with her, nor off the highway, nor with any other girl.
Was you drunk or sober then?
I was not sober, nor drunk.
I am a beadle . I was in the watch-house; this man came, and said, he had been robbed of his watch. I went, from an information I had received, to a kind of a shed, where people sleep; there were three persons there, and the prisoner charged them all three with robbing him. From something that dropped, I understood that the prisoner was the person who had robbed him. We went to the prisoner's lodging, and when he saw her, he said, that was the woman who knocked him down, and robbed him. I asked her, where the watch was? She said, If you will let me off, I will produce the clicker; and, with a deal of difficulty, I got the watch from her .
I came from Bow to an acquaintance, where I was taken. The prosecutor was several times in a room with this woman, and left his watch with her.
