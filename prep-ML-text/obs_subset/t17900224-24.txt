I am a lamp lighter . My kettle and three quarts of lamp oil were stolen from the King's Arms, Limehouse , I left it there about half past five: on Thursday, between six and seven in the evening, as I and my boy crossed Rope-makers-fields, I met the prisoner with it in his hand, about twenty yards from the house; I asked him what he was going to do with it? he said, he was going to the yard to wash his saw; he had no saw about him; I asked him where he got it? he said, he got it out of a house; I took him back to the house where he got it out of, and there were three pints spilt on the ground; I left it in a box adjoining to the bar, in the publick-house; I was late that afternoon, and put more oil in than I thought I should want, and left it there; I have left the oil there ever since Michaelmas day, and never lost any before.
Are you sure it is your kettle?
Yes; one of the cross pieces being broke, and made fast by a piece of cotton.
I am a lamp lighter. Coming out of Rope-makers-fields, I met the prisoner with the kettle in his hands, coming out of Limehouse-corner, from where the kettle laid, about twenty yards from the house.
Do you know whether it belongs to Pownel?
Yes, I do: the prisoner said he had it given him out of a house, but did not say whose house it was.
Was the man in liquor?
Yes, but he seemed to know what he was about, by desiring I would not send for an officer.
As my mate and I were coming from Limehouse-corner; we were very much in liquor; my mate kicked a can down, that stood in the passage of this house, and I picked it up again immediately, in doing it I rather fell myself; the man comes to me directly, and asked me what I was going to do with the kettle.
