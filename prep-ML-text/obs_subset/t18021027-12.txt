I am clerk in the house of John Garcias and Thomas Lewis: On Friday, the 17th of September, I was at Galley-quay , attending to the landing of some Spanish juice, and while I was in conversation with the surveyor, I heard that some persons had taken a sample of juice; I looked round and saw Mr. Stennett, who had hold of the prisoner's collar; he had seven sticks of Spanish juice, which he said he had taken from the prisoner; I went up to Mr. Stennett, and desired him to take care of the prisoner, for I must mind the remainder of the juice; there was no juice upon the Quay at that time, but the prosecutor's; I examined the case, and found one, near the prisoner, which had been broken open, and a quantity was gone out of it; the seven stcks weighed about three quarters of a pound; a constable was sent for, and Mr. Stennett gave charge of him.
I am assistant at Galley-quay: On Friday, the 17th of September, between four and five o'clock, I heard a person call out that a man was robbing a case of juice; I immediately went up and collared the prisoner, as he was walking away from the case; I took out of his hand seven sticks of juice; I then took him back to the case, and found one side of the case broke; I secured him till the constable came, who searched him and found upon him nine more sticks; I saw it taken from his breeches and his coat, under his apron; the constable took charge of him.
I was passing some chests, when I struck against something on the ground, I did not know what it was, and I picked it up and put it in the waistband of my breeches.
