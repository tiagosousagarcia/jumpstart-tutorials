I live at No. 6, in Leman-street, near Mr. Monk's: On the 11th of February, I was coming from White Lion-street, and as I was passing Mr. Monk shop, I observed the prisoner take one of the boots that were hanging outside Mr. Monk's shop.
Are you sure it was the prisoner?
I am; after I had passed him, I stood to observe how he would act; after a few minutes, he took down the other boot, and then went away immediately, he went down a court that was even with Mr. Monk's house; I then rang at Mr. Monk's door, and informed his son of it; his son and I pursued him down there, and took him with the boots in his hand; I brought him back into Mr. Monk's shop, and from thence we took him to the public-office, Lambeth-street; the prosecutor's son took the boots to the office; I wrote my name in the boots before they were returned to the prosecutor.
I am a boot and shoemaker , (produces the boots) I am perfectly satisfied they are my boots, we always know our own manufacture.
These are the boots that the prisoner took, and that I marked.
I have nothing to say.
