- I am a coach-maker , and work with Mr. Godsall: I went into the country for about three weeks, when I returned I missed my jacket; the prisoner is errand boy in the shop: On Saturday the 27th of August, I was going along Great Earl-street, and saw it hang up for sale; I asked the price of it, the man said seven shillings and sixpence. I left two shillings earnest to secure the jacket while I got an officer, which I did.
- I keep a sale-shop in Great Earl-street; I exchanged the jacket for a coat to the prisoner; I asked him how he came by it; he said, it was his master's but misfitted, and he had given it to him to exchange for what he liked.(The jacket produced and identified.)
