I keep the Ipswich-arms in Cullum-street ; the prisoner had worked for me about two months; he had left me about six weeks. I can only prove the property.
My husband is a shoemaker. I was at a public-house, Mr. Moody's, in Field-lane; the prisoner was there, and asked me to pawn a pair of sheets for him, it was about three weeks ago, I cannot tell the day of the month, I pledged them in Fleet-market.
I am servant to a pawnbroker; (produces the sheets) The last witness brought me a pair of sheets to pledge, on the 18th of December; she said she brought them from a Mrs. Morgan, in Fleet-street; she went out as I understood, to fetch Mrs. Morgan. In half an hour after, a person calling himself Delapp came, said they were his sheets, and he had come to settle it; he said, he lived in Field-lane, and I sent a young man with him to enquire; that is all I know of it. I have kept the sheets ever since. Mr. Delapp was taken into custody, and was released on the Thursday following, when the prisoner was taken up; the sheets have the name printed in large letters in the middle.
These are the same sheets.
I am a constable: On Sunday the 19th of December, Ann Delapp came to me; I went with her, and apprehended the prisoner by her direction; after I had secured him, I went back to the place where I took him from, and found this blanket and this sheet - (producing them.) The property was identified by the prosecutor.
I was coming through Leadenhall-market, and found a bundle, which contained these sheets. GUILTY .
