I keep a shop in Ratcliff-highway : On the 4th of May, between eight and nine o'clock in the evening, I observed the piece of cloth near the door; I missed it soon after, and looked out, when I saw the prisoner with it, about four yards from the door; I called stop thief, and saw him throw it down; I never lost fight of him, and he was taken; I did not see him in the shop, or had any knowledge of him before.
I was sent to measure some work, and returning, I met a shopmate, and drank with him till eight o'clock, when I run to get back to my time; I saw a man running, and throw away the cloth; an alarm was made, and I was taken.
