I am a cooper , in Whitechapel : On the 11th of January, I lost a tub from under my window; in consequence of information, I went into Fieldgate-street, and saw the prisoner with the tub resting upon his hip; he was walking very fast with it; I stopped him, and brought him back; he said, it was his first offence; he was taken before a Magistrate, and committed.
I saw the prisoner take the tub away, and I informed Mr. Francis of it.
I have nothing to say.
