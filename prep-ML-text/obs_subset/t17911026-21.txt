I lost the sacking on the 11th of October last; it was on a Tuesday; I only prove the property.
I saw the prisoner take the sacking from the warehouse between one and two; I saw him stopped with it. The prisoner brought it back to the warehouse, and put it down.
I am shopman; I had been to dinner, and left this man Brotherhead in the shop; I was informed the prisoner had taken something; I ran after him; he was about 20 yards; I followed him 100 yards; I asked him where he was going with it; I took him by the collar, and made him bring it back. The cloth is marked D 7; it contained 24 yards; it was in the shop; I had set 20 pieces ready to go away; this was one of that 20.
Was this made up into a sack?
All in a roll.
I am constable; I was sent for to Mr. Dyer's shop; I took charge of the prisoner, and have had the sacking ever since. (Produced)
Did the prisoner come back quietly?
Yes.
I leave it to my counsel.
