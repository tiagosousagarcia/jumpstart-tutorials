- I am a stay-maker , No. 77, Holborn-bridge ; I lost a pair of stays off my counter; I know nothing of the robbery myself.
- I am servant to Mr. Stelfox; I saw the prisoner come into Mr. Stelfox's shop, take out a pair of stays, and give them to a man at the door; he came in again, was leaning over the counter, and reaching after something else; he did not see me coming; I came out directly upon his back; the other man saw me, and ran away; I immediately secured the prisoner; my master has lost 100l. worth of stays lately in that way.
I went into the shop to buy some silk; I never meddled with any stays at all.
Do you sell silk?
No, nothing but stays.
