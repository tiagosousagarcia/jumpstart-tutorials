I live with David Lawrence , a corn-chandler , in Kingsland-road : On the 19th of November, I saw the prisoner run out of the yard with a fowl in his hand, which he had taken off the roost between five and six o'clock; I run in and told my mistress.
I heard an alarm given that somebody had stolen my fowls: I ran over to the Cherry-tree Inn, and the people desired me to go into the house at the corner; I fetched a constable, and he went up stairs, I stood at the door to prevent any body going out.
On the 19th of November, Lawrence came to me, I went to the house the corner of the Cherry-tree Inn, and went up stairs; I heard a hustling at the top of the stairs, I saw the prisoner throw something out, but did not observe what; I heard the ostler in the yard say, here is a fowl coming out of the window; I looked out and saw a fowl on the tiles; I took the prisoner, and he said he was just got up; I looked at his shoes, and he was up to his ankles in fresh mud.
I am ostler at the Cherry-tree, and saw a fowl thrown out of window.
I am a soldier , I had just come off duty, and went to bed; I am as innocent of it as a child unborn; there were other lodgers in the house.
