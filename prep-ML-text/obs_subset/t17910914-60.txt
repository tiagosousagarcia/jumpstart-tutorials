I keep a public-house , Northampton-street, Wood's-close, Clerkenwell ; I let a lodgings to this woman and her husband on the 12th of the month; a young man out of the country coming to see me, and going to bed, I missed the sheets; in the morning I spoke to the prisoner at the bar, and says, it is my opinion that Mrs. Berry and her sister had stole the sheets, who lodged in the next room. I found the things at the pawnbroker's, and they were pawned in the name of Sarah Wright.
I would be glad if Mr. Stapleton would restore the things which he hath of mine, before I make my defence; he hath got a feather pillow, a pail, a tumbler, and a wine glass.
I am a carman. Last week I was sitting in the prosecutor's yard drinking a pint of beer, and I saw the prisoner come through the yard with something in her apron, between eight and nine in the evening; the next morning the sheets were missing.
I am servant to Mr. Gillmore, pawnbroker, St. John's-street, Clerkenwell. The prisoner came to our house on the 10th of September, and pledged this candlestick; and on the 12th she pledged a pair of sheets, between seven and eight in the evening, in the name of Sarah Wright; I am sure it is the person; I knew her before, I lent her 3 s. 6 d. on them. (Produced.)
I never pawned the sheets at all.
I am sure I took them in of the prisoner. (The sheets deposed to.)
I am a scale-beam-maker, Monkwell-street; I have know the prisoner above three quarters of a year, a very hard-working young woman. She polishes Japan waiters.
I am a butcher, Charterhouse-street, No. 2, a journeyman; I have known her four years, a very industrious woman till this time.
My husband works at Mr. Welch's, the starch-house; she lodged in our house sixteen months, three quarters of a year ago, or not quite so long; I never knew any dishonesty by her in my life.
