I am a taylor , in Surry-street, in the Strand. I lost my watch, between twelve and one at night, at No. 2, Shire lane , on the 24th of June. The prisoner accosted me in the Strand, and asked me to go to her lodging. I went with her. Going in at the door, I took my watch out of my watch-pocket, and put it into my coat pocket. I stood a while on the floor; and in less than a quarter of an hour, she ran out. I put my hand in my pocket, and missed my watch.
Did you perceive her put her hand into your pocket?
No. I pursued her down the yard; but three or four girls stopped me at the bottom, and I lost sight of her. In the evening, I went to the Office in Bow-street, and made my complaint. An officer came along with me; and coming down Shire-lane, I saw the prisoner standing at the door. I told the officer, that was the person that took my watch. I have never found my watch again.
Are you sure the prisoner is the woman?
Yes.
I never saw the man before he came down the lane with the constable, and took me up.
I live at No. 2, in Shire-lane. The prisoner lodged in my house. She is a very sober woman. She went to be that night, in my house, between eleven and twelve o'clock. I was below in the kitchen. I am sure she could not go out after that, because I double-locked the door, and kept the key. I locked the door at twelve o'clock.
Are you sure nobody went in or out after that?
No soul upon earth.
I lodge with the last witness. On the 24th of June, I came home from the Haunch of Venison, in Bell-yard, at about a quarter after eleven o'clock. The prisoner lies in the next room to me; there is only a thin partition between. She came up, and locked her door, and went to bed about a quarter after eleven. She was taken up next day.
