I am a carpenter . I only know I lost a saw from the building.
I am a bricklayer's labourer; I was at work at this building, John Webb , a lad called out to me, that a man had taken a saw; I turned my head, and saw the prisoner with the saw under his coat, I went up to him, and said, old blade, have you got a saw to sell; he said, no; I said, I will thank you to give it me, he told me, he should not; I said, it was a carpenter's in the building; he said, he was at work at a job, and I might follow him, and see where it was; going along, I asked him how much farther it was; he said, about a mile; I kept close to him all that way, and then I got out of patience, he took into the fields, and made off; I called out, and he was stopped by a young fellow. I took him back and the saw, and the officer took him in custody and the saw.
My father is a bricklayer, I saw the prisoner take the saw up. I told Day, he went after him.
I am an officer. That is the saw I got when I took charge of the prisoner. The prisoner begged they would forgive him, and not to take him before the mhgistrate.
My Lord, and Gentlemen of the Jury. It is with extreme concern I now appear before you, it is the first time in my life; I have only to offer in extenuation of my conduct, I have been confined three months with sickness, during which time I was obliged to make away with all my tools. I beg my offence may be considered to arise from necessity, and not from depravity, and should I be considered an object to experience the lenity of the court, the most grateful sensations of heart will be ever acknowledged, by your most penitent servant.
