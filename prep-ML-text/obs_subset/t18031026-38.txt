- I am a stay-maker , No. 7, Milk-alley, St. Ann's, Soho : On the 23d of September, between four and five in the afternoon, I lost some lead; it was cut from the main pipe in the back kitchen, with a brass cock fixed to it; I rent the house of John Weldon ; I went down into the kitchen, and found the prisoner; he offered me money to put it on again, and say nothing about it; he said, he went there to ease himself.
I look after the prosecutor's house and family; I was by when the prisoner offered him money to put it on again.
I am a stone-mason; I live in the front kitchen of this house; I was ill with a cold, and stopped at home; I saw the pipe move; I sent a girl into the back kitchen to see if any body was there; I then saw the prisoner with the pipe in his hand; he was going up stairs to the yard, and I laid hold of him by the collar till Mr. Dent came.
I went into the back kitchen to ease myself; I asked leave of a man who stood in the passage; the last witness followed me, and knocked me down.
