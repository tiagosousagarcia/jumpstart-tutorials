I live in Kentish-town ; on Wednesday last, in the afternoon, I lost the things mentioned in the indictment; I saw them just before in a garden opposite my shop; and I saw the prisoner go past with the things under his right arm, over the hedge, about twenty yards from the garden; I ran after him; he dropped the things; I pursued him about half a mile, and took him; I never lost sight of him, only while he ran into a necessary; it was about half after two in the afternoon; I delivered him to the constable, and he was committed; I never saw him before; he might easily get into the garden over the fence; the shirts are mine; I cannot speak to the table cloths.
I saw the prisoner drop the things; and I picked them up.
I found the things.
