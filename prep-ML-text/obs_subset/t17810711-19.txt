I live with Messrs. Thomas Knott and William Burloft , haberdashers , in King-street, Covent-garden . On Saturday, the 30th of June, the prisoner came into the shop: I shewed her some ribbons in a drawer; I first shewed her some lace. While I was taking the lace away, I suspected she had taken some ribbon, because she had something in her hand under her cloak. She bought a yard or a yard and half of ribbon, and paid for it. I charged her with having taken some ribbon: I took her up stairs into the dining-room; there I repeated the charge to her, and she gave me the ribbon out of her pocket: this is it (producing it) I know it to be my master's property, being the mark upon it, which is my writing. I asked her, why she took it? She said, she did not know. We sent for a constable, and she was committed.
The gentleman said I had some ribbon: I said I did not know that I had, but if I had, I would give it him.
