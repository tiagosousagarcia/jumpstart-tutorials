I lost a carcase from my door; I saw it at my door about twenty minutes before eight in the evening of the 12th of November; it was stopped on the back of the prisoner, in Old-street, about 200 yards from my door; I know it was my sheep; it was scored with a long score all down the side.
I dressed the sheep, and hung it out upon a hook; I swear to it by my mark, I could know it from a thousand.
I am an apothecary; I pursued the prisoner; he had a carcase upon his shoulder; I took him about 200 yards from the prosecutor's house.
I was one that stopped the prisoner, with a carcase of mutton on him.
I only know the taking him before the justice.
On the 12th of November I saw a man with a sheep on his shoulder; he said, if I would carry it for him, he would satisfy me for it; the man walked before me; and when I was stopped, one of the witnesses said, why don't you look after the other man?
