I live in James-street, No.2, Manchester-square . I am a cordwainer .
Was you at home when these things were stolen from you?
No, I found them concealed on Monday the 12th of January.
When did you last see them at home?
Saturday the 10th, by the fire side of my own room; I have only one room, the furniture is my own. I rent the room.
Did you go out on that day?
Yes, about half past eight o'clock.
When did you return?
In about a quarter of an hour.
Were the things missing then?
Yes.
I am the pawnbroker; the prisoner pledged the gown with me on Monday morning.
Did you ever see her before?
Not that I know of. I am sure it was her; she pawned it in the name of Ann Ponrey, for half a crown.
to Prosecutor. Did you know the prisoner before?
Never saw her before with my eyes, till I apprehended her in Carnaby-market. I have got a poor wife that is blind and cannot come, and got two fatherless children. The gown was hung on the nail of the mantle piece wet, and here is a bit that was left on the nail, when it was snatched off, that matches.
I was at Westminster, No. 21, Charles-street, when he lost his property; at Mr. Jacques's. I went to receive my week's wages, and I was there about nine o'clock at night, at Mr. Jacques's, that I can take my oath of, and coming home I felt something under my feet and did not know what it was, and went back and picked it up, and it was this gown; (I never saw the man in my life, nor know where he lives) and I went and pawned it on Monday, for half a crown, and I never saw the man nor he never saw me before in his life; I don't know where his apartments are.
to Prosecutor. Did you find any other of the property?
Yes, a half shawl on her neck.
The shawl was put about the gown.
Do you know how the shawl was left?
It was not on the gown, it was on another line.
I offered him two guineas to make it up at the justice's, and he would not take it.
He was very right not to take it.
