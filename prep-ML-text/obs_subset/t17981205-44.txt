I am the wife of John Heslop , I live near Westminster-market . Six weeks ago last Saturday, one Elizabeth Bell came and took a lodging of me, I think it was on the 18th of October, I had a very good character with her.
Do you mean the prisoner?
No, she asked me if she might take another woman in with her, as both their husbands were in Ireland, to help to pay her rent; they paid me one week, and in about three weeks I missed the sheet and the blanket off the bed.
Did Mrs. Bell hire this blanket and sheet with the room?
It was my furniture; I heard that Mr. Bell was gone to Ireland.
Did not the prisoner pay Mrs. Bell for the use of the room, and of the furniture?
I dare say she did, but I do not know; I saw the property afterwards at the pawnbroker's.
I am an officer, I found the duplicate upon the prisoner, that is all I know of it.
This is the duplicate I gave the prisoner.
Mrs. Bell gave them me to pawn, and I did not think any harm of it.
