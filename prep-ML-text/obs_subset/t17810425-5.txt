I keep a public-house in Gray's-Inn-lane . The prisoner was my servant : I keep two maid servants. I had a boy in the month of March last: the boy had been ill, and went away. Some time about the beginning of March the prisoner took care of the bedding of the house. On the 15th of March, I turned her away, because she had grown lazy; she had been with me not more than three weeks. On the 17th of March, my wife missed a sheet that had been upon the boy's bed: the prisoner was found, and charged with taking the sheet; afterwards the other maid came to me, and desired three shillings upon the account of the prisoner at the bar; that the sheet had been pawned, and she wanted three shillings to redeem it. I gave the other maid three shillings, and I went to watch at a pawnbroker's; soon after the prisoner came there; she threw down the three shillings, and had the sheet, upon which I seized her, and charged her with stealing it: the sheet was pawned in my wife's name.
I am a pawnbroker. On the 17th of March, the prisoner brought a sheet to my house, and pawned it for three shillings, in the name of Margaret Steward , No. 4, Rose-court.
Though I took the sheet, I did not do it with intention to steal it, but to redeem it from pawn by getting some of my wages of my master; I was in great distress; there was some wages due to me.
