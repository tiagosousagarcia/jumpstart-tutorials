I live at No. 99, Oxford-street , and am a hosier : On the 16th of October, about four o'clock, I saw the prisoner take the stockings from the door, which were pinned to a line; he ran away with them, about the distance of three doors; I called stop thief, and he threw them in my face. (The stockings produced and identified).
I throw myself on the mercy of the court; it is the first time I was ever guilty of any thing of the sort.
