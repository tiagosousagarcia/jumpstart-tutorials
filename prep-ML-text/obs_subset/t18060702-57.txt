I am the wife of William Simpson , my husband is a coachman , I live at No. 32, Marylebone lane , at John Pritchard 's house, I have the first floor front room.
What is the prisoner.
She lives in the back room; I lost the articles on the 17th of June, I left them in my room, I returned in about three minutes and they were gone, I pursued after her, but could get no tidings of her; the man that kept her took her at Fleet market and brought her to Marlborough street; he fetched us. I have never found any of my property.
The house is full of lodgers.
