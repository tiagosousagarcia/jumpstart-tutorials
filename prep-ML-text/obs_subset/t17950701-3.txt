A neighbour of mine, of the name of Wright, see the prisoner steal a piece of print from my door, I was not at home.
Where do you live?
In Leadenhall-street .
A linen draper ?
Yes. It was found on him.
I see the prisoner at the bar about ten or twelve days ago, about eleven o'clock in the day; I was in my own shop, I see the prisoner steal a piece of cotton from Mr. Alger's door, he put it under his coat, and was making off with it; I immediately quitted my shop, went out and took him, and he dropped the piece of cotton at my feet; I ran after and took him, and a man here, that is not present, took up the cotton.
I have got the property, I picked it up, seeing the prisoner drop it; I picked up the property while Mr. Wright was pursuing the prisoner. (Produced.)
That is my property, it has my private mark, and my name also, my own writing.
What is the value of it?
Forty shillings.
