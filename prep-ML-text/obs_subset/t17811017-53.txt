I am a carpenter . Last Saturday week, at about eleven at night, having been spending the evening at the corner of Blue-court, Saffron-hill, I came down Saffron-hill to Fleet-market . The prisoner and another girl laid hold of me, and asked me to give them some gin. The prisoner said, I live in the court, just here. I went out of curiosity as far as the door. A girl came out with a candle. I gave one of the girls twopence-halfpenny, to fetch some gin. The prisoner began to feel about my pocket. I thought of my watch, took it out, and held it in my hand a little time; and then, to secure it, I put it loose in my coat pocket. She saw that, put her hand in, and took it out. She blew out the candle, whipped round the door, and pulled it to, and shut me in. I put up the sash, and got out, and took the girl that went for the gin. I called the Watch. When the watchmen came, they brought the prisoner from another house, and asked me if that was the girl. I said I did not know then; I was in a flurry with losing my watch. On Monday morning I went into the court. The prisoner looked out of the window, and I knew she was the girl. We took her to Justice Girdler's: there she owned she took it out of my pocket, and had sold it to a Mrs. Mealing, in Turnmill-street, for 8 s. I have never seen it since.
Was you quite sober?
A little in liquor.
I was at Justice Girdler's. The prisoner cried exceedingly, and said, she did steal the watch, and had sold it to Mrs. Mealing. That confession was voluntary. She was re-committe, and Mealing was admitted to bill.
On Saturday night, the watchman fetched me down. The prosecutor said I was not the girl. He and another man came into the court on Monday morning, and asked me for his watch. I said I knew nothing of it. The prosecutor made me very drunk, and said, if I would only say I sold it to Mrs. Mealing, he would clear me.
To the Prosecutor. Is that true?
No, not a word of it.
