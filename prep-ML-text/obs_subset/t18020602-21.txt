I am footman to Mrs. Wlhtaker: On Sunday evening, the 16th of May, about half-past ten o'clock in the evening, I was out with the carriage; my great coat was in the carriage; we were standing at a public-house door; I had information my coat was gone; the prisoner and two more had been having a glass of liquor at the bar; suspicion fell upon him; we went into the first court in Piccadilly, from Bond-street, and found him, with my coat lying by the side of him; I immediately charged the watch with him; the prisoner is an occasional waterman to coaches.
I keep a public house: The prisoner and two more had had a glass of liquor; I went up a court in Piccadilly, and saw the prisoner stooping down; I picked up the coat close to him.
I know nothing of the coat; I had had some water thrown over me, and I went up the court and pulled off my coat; I did not see the other coat; it was a very dark night.
