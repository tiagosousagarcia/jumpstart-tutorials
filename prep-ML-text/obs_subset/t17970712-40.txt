The prisoner came to me and asked me if I could give him a job, I work for Mr. Rhodes, a scavenger, I employ both men and women for Mr. Rhodes; he came to me on the 5th of June, and I told him to go to work; after dinner I saw him walking about the road, I told him I thought I had ordered him to go to work; and he came to me to the public-house where I lodged, and asked me for a shilling, and I told him I would not give him a shilling because he did not go to work; I had seen my watch at a quarter past two, in the room, it was then hanging up at the bedstead; I missed it about five, when I went up to clean myself.
I was sent for by the prosecutor: I took the prisoner to the watch-house, I searched him, and found this watch in his breeches.
This is my watch.
