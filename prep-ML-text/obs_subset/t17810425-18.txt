I was acquainted with the prisoner, and used sometimes to drink with him at a public-house. On the 30th of March, the prisoner came into my house, and asked if I would drink a drop with him; I said I had no objection; he gave me the money to fetch the liquor; I went out for it; when I came back, he was gone; I missed a buckle out of one of my shoes, which was standing in the window: there was a Mrs. Habbs I left with the prisoner in the room when I went out, and she was there when I came back; that woman is not here; went out to look after my buckle, and found it in a Mr. Prior's (a silversmith) shop, half an hour after it was missed; I believe he took it out of a joke; I should not have prosecuted him, but they hastily bound me over.
Did he acknowledge taking it?
No; he denied it.
About half an hour before the prosecutrix came, I bought this buckle of the prisoner ( producing it) it was broke; he said his wife and he had been playing together, and had broke it.
I can't swear that it is mine.
I never saw the shoes nor buckles: the prosecutrix asked me if I had taken them out of a joke.
