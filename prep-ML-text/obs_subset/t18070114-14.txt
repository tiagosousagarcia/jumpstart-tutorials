I live in Newgate street , I am a woollen draper .
What is your partners names.
John Blacket , and James Blacket. On the 8th of January, about six o'clock in the evening, I was coming down stairs, I heard a noise in the shop; the next witness brought a boy in who had taken a piece of cloth out of the shop.
Where was it before it was taken.
It was laying upon a table in the middle of the shop.
I am a stay maker, I was coming down Holborn last Thursday about six o'clock in the evening, I saw this boy in company with another by the middle of Turnstile, Holborn; he was standing by the edge of the pavement, whistling and calling some other person to him; I told him he had better go about his business for he was doing no good there. And just as I was coming into Newgate street, they passed me again; I crossed over the way, and they went up Newgate street, I saw him stop at the shop window, and look into the shop; there was a coach coming by just at the time, and I saw the prisoner run across the way with this piece of kerseymere; I took hold of him and took him over to Mr. Blacket's house; he sent for an officer, and took him in custody.
What became of the other boy.
The other boy ran down the street.
You are sure this is the same boy that you saw before.
Yes, because I looked him full in the face, and told him he would do no good there.
I am an officer; the prisoner was given into my custody, and this is the bundle; I have had it ever since.
I should be very happy to go to sea.
