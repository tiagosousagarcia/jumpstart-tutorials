I keep the Horns, Upper Thames-street ; I lost a pewter quart pot, and a pewter pint pot, on the 13th of December, at half past five; the prisoner came, and I missed the pint he drank out of; having suspicion, I sent for the constable, William Williams , and he searched him in my house, where I detained him, and found a quart pot of mine in his breeches, a pint pot in his bosom, one pint out of his waistcoat, and one out of each coat, and a half-pint out of his waistcoat; I delivered them all into the constable's hands, who lent me the hand to search; my name is on the quart, and a cypher on the pint; it is what they call a bar pint; we particularly missed the cypher pot that day, as it was the pint he had to drink out of, and he was asked for it, and did not produce it.
I am the constable; I assisted Mr. Horwood in taking these pots from the prisoner; one quart I took from him myself, and I have all the things here now which I took and saw taken.
I keep a public-house, the Queen's-head, Darkhouse-lane ; apparently the prisoner seems to be the man I have seen a number of times; here are two pints of mine, with my name upon them.
I keep the sign of the Monument, Little Eastcheap ; here is a pint and half-pint, with my name upon them, but I cannot swear to them; I never missed them, and I never sold any with my name upon them.
I have been out of work a great while, and wanted bread, and have a sick wife.
