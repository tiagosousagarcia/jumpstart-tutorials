Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am a labourer in the East-India Company's warehouses in Haydon-square ; the prisoner was a labourer and worked in the same floor, we had worked together for some time; I have been in the service of the Company about twenty years, and as a labourer about two months: On Saturday the 23rd of August, between eleven and twelve in the forenoon, I saw Bickerstaff take some tea out of one of the Company's chests, and put it into his greatcoat pocket; these chests were open for the inspection of the trade, previous to sale; he walked away into another room, I communicated it to a commodore, Evan Jones , who acquainted Mr. Joyce, the elder.
Part of these warehouses are in the city of London?
Yes.
Is not this part of the warehouses in the city of London?
I believe not; I cannot say with certainty.
Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am a King's Officer in the India-Company's warehoueses, in Haydon-square.
Do you know whether that part of the warehouses, from which the tea was taken, is in the City or in the County?
I do not.
I am an elder of the Company's warehoueses; this part of the warehouses is in the County of Middlesex, I am certain of it.
I searched the prisoner in the elder's accompting-house; I found three bags, and a paper parcel, the paper parcel and one of the bags, I found in the waistband of his breeches, another bag was in the breeches, behind, in the seat, and the other bag was in the crown of his hat; I asked him how he came by them, and he said he had picked them up as he came out of the warehouses, and then he said it was but the first time.
(To Joyce.) Is that tea of the same sort with the tea in the company's warehouse?
Yes, it is the same fort that was in the chests for sale.
