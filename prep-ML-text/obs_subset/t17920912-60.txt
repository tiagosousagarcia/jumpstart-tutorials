I live with Mr. Summerset, linen draper, mercer, and hosier ; on Wednesday, the 12th of September, this man came in and desired to look at some stockings; I shewed him several papers of stockings; at length he said, these are not thick enough, others that I shewed him was not the rib he wanted; then he went out, and being a suspicious character, I looked over the papers, and missed one pair of stockings; and then I went after him, and took him; he begged me to let him go; I said no; then he pulled them out, and begged for mercy; I took him to the Brown Bear , and he was searched.
I am an officer; I searched the prisoner, and found these stockings in his left-hand coat pocket.
