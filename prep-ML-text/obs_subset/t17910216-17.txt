I am a salesman . I lost a woollen jacket on the 4th of this month; it was pinned up to the door along with other clothes: I did not see the prisoner take it; I was behind the counter; and I saw the clothes move; I came out, and the jacket was gone; and I seized the prisoner by the collar, and he had the jacket in his hand: I sent for a constable and delivered the jacket to him: there was my mark on it E. Z. he said somebody gave it him.
I am a constable. (Produces the jacket.)
Here is my mark on it.
I was coming past this gentleman's house, and the jacket was lying, and he came out and took me.
