I live in Cary-lane, Cheapside : On Friday, the 15th of January, a pair of silver sugar-tongs\\ were\\ sent to me to be mended, and on Tuesday morning the 19th, when they were sent for, they were missing; I was responsible for them; the prisoner was my journeyman , he was not at home at the time they were missing; I was under the necessity of going to the West-end of the town; I went out a little before eleven o'clock in the forenoon; upon my return, about two o'clock, I heard that they were at Messrs. Cox and Merle's, I went there, and saw them.
I am an apprentice to Mr. Riley; a pair of sugar-tongs were brought to be repaired, and when the man came to enquire for them, they were missing; after that, I went to Messrs. Cox and Merle's, in Little-Britain; I saw them, and knew them to be the same.
I am an apprentice to Mr. Riley; I know the tongs to be the same that I mended on the Saturday.
I am servant to Messrs. Cox and Merle's, refiners, in Little-Britain: On the 19th of January, the prisoner brought me a pair of silver sugar-tongs to sell as old silver; I supposed him to have come by them regularly; I had known him many years, he kept a silversmith's shop, in Barbican, and I did not know but he was a master at that time; about half an hour after I had purchased them, a servant of Mr. Riley's came to me, to know if I had bought a pair of old fashioned tea tongs that morning; I told him, I had, and shewed them to him; I have had them ever since. (The witness produced the tongs, which were identified by all the other witnesses.)
I have only to say, that of late years my mental faculties have been much impaired, but I hope the evidence that will appear to my character, will operate in my favour.
