I lost a child's hat, on the 22d of August last; the prisoner asked me leave to go out repeatedly, at last I gave him leave to go out; and I finished this hat in the morning; I suspected him, and took him in Soho Square; he had nothing in his pocket but a few yards of galloon; I saw the constable take the hat from behind him; he was committed.
I found the hat inside his breeches.
On the Monday before this, my master and me had a great many words, about my bed and bedding not being put to rights, and he made me work on Sundays.
