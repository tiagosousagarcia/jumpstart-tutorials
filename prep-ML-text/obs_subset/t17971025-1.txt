I am a hosier and hatter , in Tothill-street : On Thursday the 5th of October, I went to bed between eleven and twelve; I fastened my house myself; between four and five in the morning, I was alarmed by the watchman; I came down and observed the pannel of the shutter cut out, and all the goods that were in the window gone; there were eight pair of cotton stockings, and about a dozen and a half of leather shoes; those in the indictment are only what have been found since I had seen them the evening before when I shut up my shop; I saw them the next morning at the Police Office, in Queen-square.
(producing the property)
Have you any partners?
No.
You never saw the prisoner about your premisses?
No.
I am a watchman; I gave the alarm of the house being broke open.
Having some business at the Transport-office, as I was going along I heard Whatmore cry stop thief, and I secured the prisoner.
I believe them all to be mine; there is a mark of a bit of thread upon the pair of blue cotton stockings, that I made for the stocking dressers.
You make the same kind of mark, with a bit of thread, upon all that you send to the stocking-dressers?
Yes.
And they go out into the world with that mark?
Yes.
Is there any property there that is not your own?
No.
Are they the same sort of goods that you lost?
Yes.
