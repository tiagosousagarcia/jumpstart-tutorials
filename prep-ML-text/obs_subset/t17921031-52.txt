I live in Ludgate-street , I am a linen-draper ; on the 18th of October, I had suspicion of the prisoner, who was my porter ; I staid at home on the following Sunday, he had leave to go out; I searched his pocket, and found in it a very fine white handkerchief, which I have no doubt but it was cut off the same day; as soon as he came home he took that handkerchief and put it into his pocket; I seized him, and I went to his washerwoman; I told him he had better confess.
I am a constable, I searched and found the goods; I went to his mother's and to his washerwoman; I produce the goods.
