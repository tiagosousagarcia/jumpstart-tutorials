I lost a shirt which was left in my care by the captain of a ship, who was gone abroad. It was taken out of my dining-room. I had seen it about twenty-four hours before I missed it. Mrs. Duncan brought me the shirt about nine or ten days after, but where she got it I do not know. I believe it is the same shirt, but I cannot swear to it.
