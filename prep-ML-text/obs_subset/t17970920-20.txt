- I am a publican : On the 29th of August, I lost a linen sheet from one of the beds in the garret; the prisoner was employed clean the house, on the Monday, and did not come till eleven o'clock, and she was to come again on the Tuesday, to make good her day's work; in the evening, I went up stairs, and missed a sheet; the next morning, Wednesday, the prisoner came to me for half a quartern of peppermint; I told her she had got a sheet, and my wife took her into the parlour, and she confessed it, and gave me the duplicate.
You told her it would be better for her if she confessed?
No.
Nor your wife?
I cannot say. (Produces the duplicate) ; I went to the pawnbroker's, and saw it there.
- I put a sheet on the bed, on Sunday morning, and the prisoner was at work for me on the Monday and the Tuesday; I missed it on the Tuesday night, and there had been nobody in the house but her, and therefore I thought it must be her; I took her into the parlour, and told her she had better tell me the truth.
Then you must not tell us any thing that she said?
She gave my husband the ticket.
- I took in this sheet of the prisoner: I am certain she is the person.
Look at that duplicate; did you give it to the person that pawned the sheet?
Yes; it corresponds with mine.
Look at that sheet, and tell me if it is your property?
I believe it has got a B upon it, the initial of the name of the lady that I lived with; she gave it me; I have the fellow to it upon the bed.
Mrs. New could not swear to it at Bow-street.
I had no doubt at all about it, but I did not swear to it.
But you now say you believe it to be your sheet, from the mark of the B upon it?
Yes.
