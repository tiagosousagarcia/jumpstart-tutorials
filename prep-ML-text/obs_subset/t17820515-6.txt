I am the wife of Charles Williams . The prisoner was in distress; I took her in, and kept her about a fortnight: while I was gone out she stole the things mentioned in the indictment (repeating them) I met her with some of the things on her.
I took a gown in pawn of the prisoner.
She sent me to pawn it.
I never sent her to pawn any thing in my life.
