I am a fan manufacturer , No.55, Newgate-street ; the prisoner's wife brought his work to my warehouse, and took an opportunity of stealing fans; I found a dozen at Mr. Todd's in Fore-street, which I knew to be mine, and what struck me particularly was, that one of them, which was marked 2s. 9d. I fell at 6s. a piece wholesale.
You never saw the prisoner's wife steal any fans?
No.
She came there whenever she had occasion to come with work?
Yes.
I bought these fans of Henry Burgess.
I sold these fans to Mr. Todd; I received them from the prisoner, I understood that he was a fan-maker.
These are my fans.
The prisoner is a fan-maker?
No, he is not; he only makes a particular branch of fan-sticks; he has worked for me four or five years.
Have they any mark?
No; I will swear to them without.
You have sold a great number of the same sort?
Yes; but I mean to say I never sold these.
I am an officer; I searched the prisoner's house, and found three fans in Mrs. Bartlam's pocket.
My father is a haberdasher; I bought some fans of the prisoner's wife.
I bought some fans of the prisoner's wife, I know nothing of him.
I bought some fans of the prisoner's wife.
Did the prisoner never come to your warehouse as well as his wife?
Yes, sometimes.
They must prove that these identical fans were stolen by the wife; here is no evidence to shew that they were not stolen by the husband; this is a very distinct offence from that; it is true she was convicted, but there were three fans found upon her person, and therefore it was a proper conviction.
