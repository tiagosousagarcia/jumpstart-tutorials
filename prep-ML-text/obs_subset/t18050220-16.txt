I am shopman to Richard Jacobs , umbrella and stick manufacturer ; I am left in charge of Mr. Jacobs's shop every Friday evening and Saturday, he being a Jew: On Saturday, the 19th of January last, I received information of an umbrella being taken off the hooks that were in the bressomer, at the front of the shop; I pursued the prisoner, and took him in the street, with the property in his hand; I brought him back to the shop, and detained him till I procured a constable; he was taken to Marlborough-street, and from there he was committed to prison.
A young man, apparently about twenty-four or twenty-five years of age, told me that a man had ran away with an umbrella from Mr. Jacobs's; I went immediately and told my neighbour, Goodwin run after him, and brought him back and the umbrella both; the young man did not stop, but he saw him take it away, and to the best of my knowledge he took it off the wires.
I produce the umbrella, it was hung upon a hook, it is not very easy for persons that are not acquainted with the hooks to take it off.
I was coming through that court, it is a thoroughfare to Conduit-street, for any body to come through; I picked up this umbrella, and as I was walking towards Conduit-street this man ran after me, and said, that is my umbrella; I said, it is not mine, I have just picked it up.
You had not dropped an umbrella?
No; I picked it up.
