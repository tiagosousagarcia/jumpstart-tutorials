I am a brass-founder in Great Wild-Street ; the prisoner worked for me; the brass was lost before I was up in the morning.
I saw the prisoner take a bag of brass out of my master's house on the 9th of October, in the morning; I followed him to a shop in St. Giles's. I saw him put it into a scale, and the weight put against it. I went into the shop, and asked him what he was doing there; he came to the door; I bid him take the bag of brass again; he said it did not belong to him; a boy in the shop said it did not belong to him; I bid him take it; he would not; I took the brass out of the scale myself and made him carry it back, and sent to Sir John Fielding 's for an officer, and he was secured.
It is old coach brass, I believe. It is a bag I had iron shanks out of the country in. I cannot swear to it. It was taken out of an hogshead of old brass. The hogshead was full. It appeared lower afterwards than it was before.
