On the 5th of November, about eleven o'clock in the day, I saw the prisoner take my brother's great coat out of my father's cart in Oxford-street , opposite the Green Man; I followed him, and took him with the coat.
I was helping a drayman close to the cart; I threw my great coat into a cart, and I thought this had been mine; my own was gone.
