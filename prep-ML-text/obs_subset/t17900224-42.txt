I am not a housekeeper; Mr. Povey is the landlord, and lives there, and lets the rest of the apartments: I lost the things by the room door being forced open, and two boxes; it was the 8th; I went out about seven in the morning, and came back within a quarter of twelve at night.
How did you find your door when you came back?
I locked it, and carried the key down to the landlady, to make the bed; when I came home I found the door open; the staple of the door was forced back, and I went and looked at my boxes, and found them broke open, and all my property gone; I have never had any of my property but one shirt; it is in the constable's hands; the constable has it here.
As to the door of the house, was that broke open?
I cannot say to that.
The house belongs to my husband, we live in it; and let part of it to lodgers. I went up stairs, as usual, about four o'clock, to make the bed, and at that time every thing was safe; I had the key till the time he came home? I know Mr. Close had boxes in the room, but I know nothing what was missing.
I am a constable. I have a shirt I took off the prisoner's back, on the 2d of February.
I went along with Ting, at the apprehending of this man, and saw the shirt taken off his back.
I keep the Green Man, in the New-road, Marybone. On Friday, the 8th of January, the prisoner came to my house, in the afternoon, and continued there all the day; and I was desired to take care of some money which he had; it was ten guineas and a half: a patrol before my house sold him a watch for three guineas, which I saw, as well as saw him let a friend have a guinea.
Did you see the lodger in the house the 8th of January?
No, I did not, but he lodged there at that time, and absconded ever since.
I was out at work at Whitechapel, from the 9th of January, for three weeks.
I can swear to making this shirt for Mr. Close.
