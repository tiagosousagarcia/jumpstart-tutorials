I am the wife of James Groves , he lives at Mile End ; on the 11th of October, between the hours of eleven and twelve in the day, I lost a table cloth, a tea caddee, and a child's frock; I lost them out of my house in the lower room: George Johnston owned he had took the goods.
I keep a publick house, the sign of the Black Bull; the prisoner came to my house on the 11th of October, between the hours of eleven and twelve o'clock, and had a pint of beer in company with another black man, and offered a tea caddee to sell; he had another bundle.
I am a pawnbroker's servant in White Chapel; on the 11th of October, about twelve o'clock, I saw the prisoner in our shop with a tea caddee, a table cloth, and a child's frock; he lent 2 s. 6 d. on the tea caddee, and 4 d. on the frock. (The caddee, table cloth, and frock deposed to.)
I was very drunk.
