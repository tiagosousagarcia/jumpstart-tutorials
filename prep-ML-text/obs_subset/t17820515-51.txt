I am a Free-mason . I keep the White Swan, at the top of Old Gravel-lane . On the 22d of April, I lost a silver collar and a jewel. The prisoner is a soldier , and was quartered at my house. I don't know any thing of his taking them, only by his own confession.
My mother keeps a clothes shop, in Rosemary-Branch alley. The prisoner brought the jewel to sell; my mother gave him half-a-crown for it; she did not think it was silver, only plated; I was present at the time, and am sure it was the prisoner that brought it.
When I found where it was, I sent for it, and they made me pay 5 s. for it.
My mother had sold it to a man for 4 s. she sent for it, and he would have a shilling for his trouble.
I was cleaning Mr. Cooke's bed-room, and Mrs. Cooke charged me with stealing it, and threatened to send for an officer; I said she might, that I was innocent. She asked the prisoner about it; he denied it: I took him into the other room, and said, if he would confess it, I would give him part of the money to get it again: Mrs. Cooke said, if he would confess, she would not hurt him, but pay the money, and send for it.
