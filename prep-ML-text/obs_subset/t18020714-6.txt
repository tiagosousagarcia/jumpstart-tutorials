I live in the parish of Bethnal-green : On Thursday, the 8th of July, I lost three ducks; I know nothing of it myself.
I am servant to Mr. Farmer: On the 8th of July, between nine and ten in the evening, I heard a noise among the ducks; I went out into the yard, and heard the ducks cry; I saw the prisoner, but it was so dark that I could not see whether he had one in his hand or not; I heard him catch them up; I told him if he stirred, I would cut him down; he got over the fence, and I went after him, and gave him a blow on the side of his head, which cut him down; he got up, and got away; I went after him, and cut him down again; I laid hold of him by the collar, and got some assistance; we secured him, and brought him back; I afterwards went to the place where I had seen the prisoner, and there I found a bag with three live ducks in it; I never lost fight of him all the way; we counted the ducks, and found two short of the number.
You found three in the bag?
Yes, and when I went to lay hold of the bag, one of them run out; they were the same sort of ducks we had in the yard.
How many ducks had you in the yard?
Twenty-one dozen and five.
You do not mean to swear to the ducks?
No, I cannot.
There was nothing remarkable in the colour of those ducks?
No.
Did you count them over?
No; the man that counted them is not here.
You fought stoutly, and gave him a pretty handsome cut; that mark upon his cheek, which he will carry to his grave, is your cut, is it not?
Yes.
What did you cut him with, a cutlass?
Yes.
I am inspector of the watch at Bethnal-green: On the 8th of July the prisoner was brought to our watch-house, with this bag and these ducks.
I assisted in securing the prisoner.
I believe the ducks to be mine, but I cannot positively swear to them.
