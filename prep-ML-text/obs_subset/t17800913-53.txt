I am master of the ship; I lost a rope called a pudding; I saw the coil and the pudding in the ship on the 2d of August; I believe this to be the same rope from the size of it; there is no particular mark upon it. I am sure this is the pudding.
On Thursday the 3d of July I was told by a gentleman that a man was gone out of the ship with a pudding on his back; I followed him immediately to an old stuff shop, and saw the pudding. They turned him out of the house. I said if they would not buy it I would take him to a place where he might dispose of it; I took him to the yard and sent for an officer.
I saw the prisoner between five and six in the morning coming over the side of the ship, with such a coil as this on his back; I went on board the ship, and told Stamford of it.
I found the coil at the old stuff shop, where he had left it.
I took charge of the prisoner with this pudding, and took him before the justice. This is the pudding.
What is the worth of the ropes?
Ten shillings.
The captain gave it to us.
I never gave it to him. The ship is since sold. I was then captain of her. I had some labourers at work the day before; I told them to be sharp, and I would give them some short pieces which lay upon the deck. This was in the hold; that on the deck was of no use.
