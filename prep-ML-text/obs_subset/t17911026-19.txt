I keep a stationer's shop in the Strand , near the New Church, on the 15th of October I lost a silver case of a pencil, with a pencil in it; I was not present.
I live with Mr. Middleton, I was in the shop on the 15th of October; I saw the prisoner in the shop about eight in the evening, he asked to see some pencil cases, I shewed him several, he bought none; he came in alone, nobody else was in the shop; he staid ten minutes or a quarter of an hour; I did not miss any thing, he bid me a good night, and went out of the shop, and was brought in again by the patrol; he was searched in my presence, and it was found upon him.
I received information from a lady of a man having stolen a silver pencil; I walked backwards and forwards, and the prisoner was looking at the pencils six or seven minutes; when he came out of the shop Sir Sampson's patrol and I stopped him, and brought him into the shop, and Sir Sampson's patrol searched him, and found a silver pencil in his left sleeve.
I am Sir Sampson's patrol. Deposed to the same effect.
I bought this pencil of a Jew the day before, and I wanted to send another to my cousins at school. I was very much in liquor.
He did not appear to me to be much in liquor.
What is the value of that pencil?
The intrinsic value I look upon to be 4 s. not 5 s.
