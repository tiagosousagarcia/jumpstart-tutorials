I live in Edgware Road ; I am a cow-keeper and farmer : I lost an iron chain, on the 18th of June; I had lost a dozen before.
I was coming out of my cow-house, between seven and eight at night, and I saw Shore, and thought he was upon no good, and I watched him; he lay down in the cart, and I staid till nine o'clock, and then I saw him get out of the cart, and take the chain.
