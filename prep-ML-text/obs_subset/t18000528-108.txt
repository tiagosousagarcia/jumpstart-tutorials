I am an apprentice to Mr. Bull, a waterman: I saw the prisoner take this iron from King James's Stairs , on Saturday the 17th of May, about four o'clock; he put it on his shoulder, and walked right up Shakespeare's-walk; I sent another boy to see which way he went, while I fetched Mr. Whates; he came with me, and saw it on the prisoner's shoulder; Mr. Whates laid hold of him, and he threw it off his shoulder, and had like to have thrown it on my head.
I am an anchor-smith : I had the iron landed at King James's Stairs, and employed three men to fetch it home; I received some information, in consequence of which, I immediately pursued the prisoner, he walked up Shakespeare's-walk, in a contrary direction to my house; just before I came up to him, within three or four yards, he threw it off his shoulder, and then I seized him; he made use of very rough language, and struck at me several times; he told me he was going to carry it to his master, and I was not his master; I never saw the man before in my life, to my knowledge.
I was standing at the stairs, and saw the prisoner take the iron upon his shoulder; I followed him, and attacked the man while the other boy went after Mr. Whates; and while we were arguing Mr. Whates came up.
The boy told me to follow the other man with the iron, and I did not know rightly where they were gone to.
