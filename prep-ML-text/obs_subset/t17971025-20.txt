I am a sine-drawer: Last Tuesday was a week, coming through Spital-square , I saw the prisoner sitting upon a step, and stripping the child; I seized her, and asked her whose child it was, she said, it was her brother's, and she was taking the clothes off to put them on in a more comfortable manner.
I live in Spital-square, I saw the prisoner take off the child's pinnafore, and its frock; I asked her why she did that, and than she doubled up the petticoat, and put it on over the frock; I stopped her till the last witness took hold of her.
I took the child home; the child told me its name, the Bellman was crying it on London-bridge, she said she had it the other side of the square.
I live in Harrod-street, near the Mint, about a mile and a half from Spital-square, the child was missing between four and five in the afternoon.
I was coming through the Borough, and saw the child crying; I asked it where its mammy was, and it pointed strait on, I led it over London-bridge, till I got to Spital-square, and I put the petticoats round its shoulders to keep it warm.
