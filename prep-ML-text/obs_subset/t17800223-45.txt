Do you know the prisoner?
Yes. I knew him before he was sent abroad.
Do you remember his being tried and convicted for any offence?
No; no more than what I heard; I was not present.
Was you present when he was ordered to be transported?
No. I was sent in search of him and one Harding, for breaking open a house in the country; we took them both at a house in Petticoat-lane.
What is his name?
William Herbert .
How do you know that that is his name?
He has gone by that name ever since I knew him.
I know the prisoner. I was present when he was tried.
Was you present when he was ordered to be transported?
No.
How long ago is it since you was at his trial?
Not quite five years ago.
Do you know what session it was at?
No; it was in the summer time.
Was it the beginning of the summer, or the latter end of it?
I believe the begining of summer.
Can you recollect at what session it was?
I do not know.
What was he tried for?
Shooting at me.
You was the prosecutor of that indictment?
Yes.
He was convicted upon that?
Yes.
Was you present when he received the king's pardon, and was ordered for transportation?
No.
Are you sure the prisoner is the man who was tried and convicted for shooting at you?
Yes, I have no doubt of it in the least.
I am the person who was convicted for shooting at that man, almost five years ago. I received his majesty's clemency for fourteen years transportation. I had not been in the country long before they compelled me to take up arms against my king and country. I took the first opportunity of deserting from their service and going over to the king's troops; I surrendered myself to Lord Cornwallis, and took the benefit of the proclamation which offered a free pardon, and leave to return to their own country, to all persons who would come over to the king's troops. I was innocent of the crime for which I was tried. George Hartley, who was convicted about two years ago, declared and took his sacrament upon it, that he was the man who shot at this man.
