I am wife of Thomas Mitchell; he keeps a publick-house on Great Tower-hill : on the 3d of March, the prisoner came into my house and went backward into the kitchen, and I lost eleven plates and two dishes; they are my husband's property; I can swear to them.
I was servant at Mr. Mitchell's; I had been out with beer, and coming back I caught the prisoner out of the doors with only this dish in his hand; it was the 3d of March, about nine at night; he was standing against a watch-house; I passed him, and returned, and saw him peeping after me round the watch-box; I went on the side of him, and saw him with the dish in his hand; I asked him what he had; he said, nothing; he dropped the dish; I took him into the house, and there were eleven plates and two dishes missing.
I went backwards, and the dish was lying in the yard; about a fortnight afterwards, they took me up for the robbery.
What was the reason you did not apprehend him at the time?
While I was gone for a constable, he absconded.
