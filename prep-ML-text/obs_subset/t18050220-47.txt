I live in Compton-mews , I take in washing: On the 21st of January, about twelve o'clock at noon, I went out to get in my linen, and left this counterpane to be sent to the mangle; when I came back, the woman that washes for me told me she had sent the counterpane by the boy.
Whose counterpane was it?
It belonged to Mr. Palmer, in Oxford-road; I had it from his house to wash it, and I had washed it, and I desired the woman to send it to the mangler's.
Mrs. Hall left the counterpane with me, and desired me to send it to the mangler's; as soon as the child came home from school, which was just after twelve o'clock, I sent him with it; I had wrapped it up in a coarse apron; he came back crying, with the apron in his hand, and said a man had taken the counterpane.
I am a pawnbroker, I produce a counterpane wrapped up in a coarse apron: On the 21st of January, about half past one o'clock, the prosecutrix called at my shop, and from information I received from her I was upon my guard; in about half an hour after I received this information, the prisoner at the bar brought the counterpane to pledge.
You are sure of his person?
That is the man (pointing to him) , and from the information we had previously received, we had every reason to suppose it was the counterpane that had been stolen; we took him to Marlborough-street, and he was committed; the prisoner said in our shop the counterpane was his own property.
What is the value of that counterpane?
Fifteen shillings.
I am not the person that took the counterpane from the child, I was in a public-house, the corner of Duke-street; there was a young man there who had been a gentleman's servant, but was then out of place; he had yellow buttons to his coat; the little boy said at Marlborough-street I was not the same person who took it from him, so I was taken in very innocent.
