This is my shift, I know it by the mark M. H. it is my mother's shift, my mother gave me two of them, her name is Mary Huggins ,
On Sunday before she went out, I went and borrowed a flat iron of her, she lent me two instead of one; I asked her if she could lend me eighteen-pence, she said no, she had no money, but if I liked it, I might take the shift to pawn for eighteen-pence.
I never lent it to her to pawn, it was hung out to dry.
