I am the wife of George Hastings , I live in Chapman-street ; I missed the property on the 1st of April, they were taken out of a brown pan in the yard; it was put in water in consequence of a stain; when the girl got up in the morning it was gone, and the marks of the prisoner's feet all over the yard; I had seen it there the night before; he was taken up the same night by the watchman; the same man had the shirts in his possession, the shirts were in the yard adjoining.
I am the wife of Richard Coulthard ; they were babies' shirts, they lay in the yard upon some railing, there were half-a-dozen of them; I saw them there a little after eight at night, I forgot to take them in.
I am a watchman: On the 1st of April, I heard the prisoner in a garden, about one; I way-laid about there till two, and I saw the prisoner coming out of the garden; I overtook him with a coverlid in his bag, wet, and a woman's coarse apron; I I did not find the shirt upon him till I got to the watch-house.
(Produces the property). I had this from the watchman.
This is my counterpane, I know it by the stain.
These are my children's shirts, I made them myself.
I have nothing to say.
