I am an Excise watchman: On Tuesday, the 19th of October, about half past one o'clock, I was on Chester-quay ; I saw the scuttle of a lighter open; I had suspicion, and went down into the lighter, and found the prisoner cutting a bag, and letting the coffee run into his handkerchief and hat; I called Smith to my assistance, and he came; there were bags belonging to different people in the lighter; I don't know who this bag belonged to.
I am a watchman belonging to the quays and the Thames Police; I was called; I went into the lower part of the lighter, and saw the prisoner and the coffee; the last witness gave me charge of him and the coffee; I gave the coffee to Hunter.
I went down to look for a person, and saw the coffee running out of the bag; I was picking it up, with intent to save it, when this gentleman came up and said I should not have it.
