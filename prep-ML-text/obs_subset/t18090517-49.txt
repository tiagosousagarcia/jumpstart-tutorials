I am a mariner , I live at 13, Paul's-square, Finsbury . On the Saturday the 14th of May, I came home about ten o'olock in the evening; my wife informed me that the girl had stolen some things; the prisoner lived servant with me; I gave her in custody of a constable; on going with her to the watch-house, she informed me that she had taken them from my house; I told her it would be better to tell the truth.
Then do not tell me what she said - did you find any thing about her
I did not.
I am the wife of the last witness. On Friday the 12th of May, I missed my child's cap out of my drawer. I asked the prisoner if she knew any thing of it; I told her if she would tell me what she had done with it before her master came home, I would not punish her; but she did not confess then. On the following day, Saturday, when she was cleaning the apartment, I saw a man's neck handkerchief drop from under her petticoats; I asked her what it was, she told me it was a handkerchief that her mother had to wash for some person, and her mother asked her to take it home for her. I looked at the handkerchief, and knew it to be my husband's by the mark; I searched her; I found one of my husband's shirts wrapped round her body next to her skin.
I live with Mr. Crouch, pawnbroker, the corner of Providence-row. On Thursday the 11th of May, a shirt was pawned with me for one shilling and six-pence, by a female.
I live in Tabernacle-walk. On the 3rd of May, I took in two towels and a handkerchief for nine-pence; it was a female that pawned them.
