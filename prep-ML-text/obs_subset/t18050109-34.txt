You are a servant of Mr. Thomas-Lowth Sedgwicke?
Yes, he is an ironmonger , in Mark-lane .
On the 20th of December last, what did you observe?
I was coming through the shop, about half after four o'clock in the afternoon, I saw the prisoner out of the window; I immediately pursued her, and took her near the bottom of Mark-lane.
Where did you find it?
Under her cloak, in her right hand; she dropped it when I took her, and I immediately picked it up, and I brought it and her to my master's shop; I produce it; it is the property of my master, I am sure of it, because it was never out of my sight.
Do you know any thing of the woman?
No, I never saw her before.
Where did she take it from?
She did not come in the shop, she took it outside of the shop, it was in the window on the street side.
I never saw the scraper at all.
