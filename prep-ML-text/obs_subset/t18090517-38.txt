I am a publican . I live at the Hope in Banner-street, Bunhill-row . From information, I perceived the prisoner had some pots under his coat; I catched hold of his collar, and two quart pots dropped from under his coat, and he had one more in his left hand coat pocket; he dropped the pots on the ground and ran away. I ran after him, and catched him again; only one of the pots belonged to me.
I live at No. 56, Banner-square. I saw the prisoner take the pot off the area-gate, over the kitchen window. I informed Mr. Forster of it.
