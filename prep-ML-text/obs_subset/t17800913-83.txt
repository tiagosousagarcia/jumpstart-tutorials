I am a servant to Mr. Squibb the auctioneer in Savile-row . Some pistols were stollen from the auction-room; I saw the prisoner there, tying up something in a handkerchief; I mentioned that there was a strange man tying something up; he was secured, and the pistols were found upon him.
I took the pistols from the Prussian ambassadors to Mr. Squibb's to be sold; I saw the prisoner come out of the room with the pistols under his arm; he had a piece of cloth tied round them; I pursued him into Old Burlington-street, and took them from him; I asked him whose pistols he had got there? he said his own; I said I believed they belonged to Mr. Squibb; he said if they were mine, I was exceedingly welcome to them; I said he should go with me, and I took him back.
How soon was this after Hughes said there was a strange man packing things up?
About ten minutes; a quarter of an hour at farthest.
I am clerk to Mr. Squibb; these are the pistols that were at our house, they came from the Prussian ambassador's, they had been there about ten minutes before the prisoner came in, the tickets on them are my hand-writing; the prisoner was very much in liquor when he was taken.
What is the value of these pistols?
Eight guineas; they were not to be disposed of under twelve guineas.
The place they were taken from was part of Mr. Squibb's dwelling-house?
It is the warehouse, it adjoins; but I believe it is not under the same roof, there are two roofs.
I was so much in liquor, I did not know any thing of it till I was taken to prison, and in the morning I asked what it was for?
He was very much in liquor; they were taken from him in Burlington-street.
When I proffered the indictment, I was told it made no difference whether it was forty shillings or eight pounds; it was never meant to take his life.
