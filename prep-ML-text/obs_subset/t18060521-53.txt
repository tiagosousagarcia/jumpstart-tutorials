You are a tallow chandler , living in Aldersgate-street.
Yes.
Was the prisoner at the bar a servant of yours.
I employed him occasionally. On the 17th of April I sent him with goods, with orders to receive the money of Mr. Richard Bass , a publican, I gave him a bill and receipt, he was to receive three pounds five, I gave him change for four guineas.
Did he ever return to you.
No, on the Monday following I saw him, he said he had lost part of the money and spent the rest; I sent him to the Compter directly.
I live at the Manchester Arms, Adam-street, Baker-street, Portman-square. On the 17th of April, the prisoner at the bar brought me some candles.
Did you pay him any money for these goods.
I paid him three pounds five shillings; I paid him in four one pound notes, he brought the change.
On whose account did you pay him that sum of money.
Upon Mr. Dunkin's account.
Mr. Dunkin, is the prisoner at the bar your servant, and did you send him with the goods that morning.
I sent him with the goods that morning, he was an occasional porter when I wanted him, perhaps I might have him once a week; he is a poor man in the workhouse.
Here is a poor man hired out of the workhouse brought here, did not he tell you he lost part of the money.
Yes, I have not the least doubt but that he lost part of the money.
