- I am a publican in East-Smithfield : the prisoner had some money to receive at the Navy-Office, and till he got that, I gave him leave to sleep in the place where this bed was, which was in an out-house belonging to me; he slept there about ten nights, when I was informed every thing was gone out of the place, even the lock and key was gone; that was on the 28th or 29th; on the 30th, in the evening, I was told he was in the street, and I went out and saw him, and asked him for the key; he said, he had left it at a friend's house, and he would go and fetch it; I told him he had robbed me, and he did not deny it; and offered to give me a warrant of attorney to receive his prize-money and his wages, if I would forgive him; his wages had been stopped, partly from a mistake, and partly from bad behaviour; I told him, I must know where they were sold; he took me to a broker of the name of Davis, where I found them, and I took them home, and gave charge of him; I then went to Davis's, to apprehend him, and he and his wife both fell upon me in a very inhuman way; and his wife laid hold of me in parts that are not fit to be named here; he got away, and since that has not been heard of; we got a search-warrant next morning, and took the things out of Davis's house.
Was the prisoner to pay so much a week?
No; I let him in out of charity, till he could get his money.
I have been a long time broke down by distress; I leave it to the mercy of the Court.
