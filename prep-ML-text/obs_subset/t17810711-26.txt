The prisoner came to my house, on Thursday, the last day of May. He brought a bag with some mackarel in it, and told me that my husband sent him; that he and some gentlemen had taken the best of them out, and I was to pay him eight shillings. I refused to give him that; and he then demanded half-a-crown, which I paid him.
What sort of mackarel were they?
All rotten and stinking. I asked him, Had Mr. Summerfield bought these mackarel? they were stinking. He said, Be they what they would, he sent him, and he was to have half-a-crown for them. I wondered at it, but paid him the half-crown.
Did you send this mackarel home?
No. On the 9th of June, as he was going by, my wife told me that was the man that defrauded her. I had him before the Alderman, who committed him.
He enquired of me where Mr. Summerfield lived.
