I am a worsted - weaver : On Friday the 18th of June, between one and two o'clock in the day, I was robbed of my pocket-book, in Leadenhall-street ; I was looking at a print-shop, the corner of Cree-church; I had not stopped half a minute before I found something rush past me, which gave me a suspicion; I directly put my hand to my pocket, and missed my pocket book; I directly turned on the right-hand, and saw the prisoner with it in his hand; I pursued him, and as soon as he found I was close upon him, he hurled it across the road, I picked it up immediately.
What coloured pocket-book was it?
A black one; I never lost fight of him till he was stopped; a gentleman, who is a stranger to me, stopped him; I took him into custody and gave charge of him.
I am a constable, the prisoner was delivered into my custody, by Mr. Newhouse; I know nothing of the transaction.
I was going down Fenchurch-street, and heard a sing out of stop thief, and two gentlemen stopped me; I am quite an innocent man, it is a malicious piece of business; my uncle and aunt are now lying bad of a fever; I very lately came from sea.
Did you know any thing of the prisoner before?
Never in my life.
Are you sure he is the man?
Yes; and he told me I had sworn his life away, and I should not be guilty of the like again.
