I live in Piccadilly; I deal in feathers ; the prisoner was my journeywoman for two months; I had been robbed of feathers and other things; I had an information that caused me to suspect the prisoner; I charged her with it; she said I was welcome to search her lodgings; I went there; I found some ostrich feathers in the bed; and, in another room, there were some in the chimney; there was a board put before the chimney; there was a pocket handkerchief, which is mine, and three bags with cock feathers in them; the bags were my property, and I believe the feathers to be mine: she confessed the things were my property; and she said, she would pay for them, or do any thing to make it up.
Do you know her father?
No.
What is he?
I don't know.
Is not he a feather-maker?
By report he is.
Have not you, from time to time, trusted her with a great many feathers?
Not ostrich feathers unmanufactured.
Have not you heard she carried on this business for herself?
I have heard so from shops where she has sold them; but, from the price she sold them at, I should suppose they were not her own.
When you entrusted her with feathers, they were in bags?
They were; I never trusted her with any in these kind of bags till within these two months; never before these three bags.
She used to work for you at her own house?
Yes; they were carried home in these bags.
I am journeyman to the prosecutor; I can only say the same he has.
I worked with the prisoner; I was to be with her two years, to learn the trade; I know nothing against her; these feathers were in the house; I do not know where they came from; she worked on her own account.
Do you remember the bags coming to the prisoner's house?
Yes; they came with work.
