On the 18th of November we had a parcel of shoe cakes from Bayley's, Cockspur-street; I saw them about five on the counter; I saw no more of them till I saw them at Mr. Wilmot's, on the Monday after the prisoner was taken; I had no doubt by the direction but they were ours.
On Saturday the 18th of November, I was walking through Gravel-lane, between seven and eight at night, I saw the prisoner in Petticoat-lane with a parcel under his arm; I passed him; there was a Jew near him; I said to another officer, that is Nicasa Key , as they call him; I followed them; I seized the prisoner, and as I took him by the collar, he dropped the parcel; this is the same; he said he found it standing against a door; I took him to the Magistrate's, and sent to the prosecutors by the direction; it has been in my possession ever since.
It is the same.
I leave it to the mercy of the Court.
