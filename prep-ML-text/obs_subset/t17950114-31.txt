I am storehouse clerk to Mr. Whitbread.
What was the prisoner?
labourer .
With you?
Yes, as a person employed about the yard.
What happened on the 3d of December?
Between five and six o'clock in the evening, I observed the prisoner to come out of the store cellar with a pail nearly full of beer; I asked him what he meant to do with it? and when he saw me he attempted to run away, however, I took him, and asked him what he meant to do with that beer? he said it was for himself and the rest of the servants to drink; he made me no other answer; I told him he had no right to go there for beer, there was good beer allowed, small beer and porter mixed; he said it was wrong; says I, come along with me to the counting house, and hear what the manager will say to you; and he followed me down with the pail in his hand, and the manager sent for a constable.
Was the cellar out of which he took this small matter of beer open?
It was open at the time.
What is contained in it?
Porter after being brewed.
Is it porter fresh brewed or fit for sale?
It was fresh, it was but young mild porter; we were doing some repairs to the shop of the cellar and consequently did not lock it down.
Was this the beer that was allowed?
No.
What sort of a character does this man bear?
I had nothing against this man before.
Why did not you give him a good scolding, or dismiss him? It is hardly worth while to ruin a man by bringing of him here.
He liked a little porter better than small beer, and it was for himself and the men to drink.
