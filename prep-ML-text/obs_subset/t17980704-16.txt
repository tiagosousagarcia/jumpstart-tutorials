On the 26th of May, I pitched a pair of pails and covers at the door of the Maidenhead, in St. Luke's parish, about a quarter before eight in the evening; I went in to get a glass of ale, I drank my ale, and lighted my pipe, and when I came out in a quarter of an hour after, the pails were gone. They were found by the constable about eight days after.
I am a constable: I went, in company with a broker, to seize some goods, and in the prisoner's apartments were these milk-pails and covers, that was on the 2d of June; I knew him before, and knew that he lived there.
These are my pails, I know them by my name being on them.
The prisoner lodged in my house. I saw the prisoner bring the pails in, on the 26th of May, about eight in the evening, and take them into his own apartment.
I never had them in my possession, or ever touched them.
