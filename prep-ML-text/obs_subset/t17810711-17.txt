I am servant at the Bull's-head, Smithfield . On the 30th of June I pulled off a linen gown at about ten o'clock at night, and hung it on the back of a chair in the parlour. At about twelve o'clock I went in to put my gown on, and it was gone: I told my master of it, and he suspected the prisoner. At about twelve o'clock the prisoner and another man had brought some boughs for our chimney; they staid about ten minutes. I saw them go out: the prisoner had something under his coat at the time. My master went after him, and the gown was found upon him by the watchman.
I am a watchman. I found the gown upon the prisoner, in Sharp's-alley: it was in a handkerchief in his hand.
I was going into this house: I met a post-chaise boy at the door with a post-chaise: I gave him 2 s. for this bundle.
