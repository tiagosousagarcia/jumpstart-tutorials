I am a widow : On Wednesday night last, about nine o'clock, as I was coming through Palace-yard , over right the Hall, the prisoner came behind me, and snatched the bundle out of my hand, and ran away directly; he had the same cloaths on that he has now; I am sure he is the man; he had a handkerchief bound round his left hand.
Was it light enough to see his face?
I saw his face coming over Westminster-bridge; I had been at Lambeth, and was going home; I live just beyond Westminster-abbey.
You know one soldier is like another; are you sure that is the man?
Yes; I saw his face on the bridge, and I saw his face when he snatched the bundle from me; I am sure he is the man.(Edward Carter, the pawn-broker, was called, but not appearing, his recognizance was ordered to be estreated).
I am an officer belonging to Queen's-square, Westminster: On Thursday morning, between eleven and twelve, I heard of two girls being stopped pledging a pair of stays; they said, they had them of a man that was then in bed, and I went and secured the prisoner; I found him in bed, and on a table in the room, I found a pair of jumps, and some sewing silk, which the prosecutrix owned; he was committed the same night, (the jumps and silk were produced in Court).
I am an officer; I was with the last witness, when he apprehended the prisoner.
I had these jumps to mend, I am answerable for them.
I went into the Rose, over Westminster-bridge; this woman came in, and gave me a share of seven pints of beer; she was very much in liquor, and desired me to carry the bundle for her; she slipped down several times upon the bridge.
Had you been drinking at all with him?
He was having a pint of beer, and I drank part of it; I thought he was a distressed man, and I gave him some.
Were you in liquor?
No; I met him at that public-house by accident.
Where is that public-house?
I don't know.
Then you must have drank?
No; I had not.
Did you give him your bundle to carry?
I did not; he followed me out of the house.
