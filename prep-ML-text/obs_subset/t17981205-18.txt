I live in the parish of Harrow : I lost three geese and a gander; the last time I saw them was about ten o'clock at night; on Sunday night, the 28th, they were brought to me dead about twelve o'clock the same night; I know them to be my geese.
What do you know them by?
There was no particular mark, but the feathers.
I took the prisoner with the geese on Sunday night the 28th of October, about half a mile from Mr. Rolfe's house; I took them to Mr. Rolfe's, they were dead; I took the prisoner with them; he told me at first that a dog catched them.
Had he a dog with him?
No; then he asked me to take the geese and let him go.
Was he drunk?
He was neither drunk nor sober.
