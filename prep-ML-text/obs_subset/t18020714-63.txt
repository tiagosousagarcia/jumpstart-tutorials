I live in Brick-lane, behind St. Luke's : I am a butcher ; I have a pigeon-house on the top of the kitchen, I lost twenty, I missed them on the 27th of May last; I found one at Mr. Preston's, alive; a fortnight after, I found another in Single-street the same day; I never saw the prisoner before, I know nothing of him.
You had no acquaintance with the prisoner?
None.
Did you never hear that he dealt in birds?
No.
That he bought them with a view to sell again?
I have heard so since; I know this to be my pigeon, by several marks.
I bought that pigeon of William Wright, I cannot absolutely swear to it; I deal in birds.
I deal in pigeons; the pigeon now produced is like the one I bought.
I sold the pigeon to Mr. Preston, which I bought of Mr. Boyd.
I sold a piegon to Mr. Trusty, I had it of Wright; so many are alike, I cannot swear to it.
