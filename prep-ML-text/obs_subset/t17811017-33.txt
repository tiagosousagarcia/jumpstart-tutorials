On Tuesday last, about half after three o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner came into my shop, and desired to look at some printed cotton. My wife shewed her some. I was standing by, serving some other customers. After shewing her different pieces for about ten minutes, she said she wanted some of a pattern she had had three weeks before. She said she would come in two or three hours, and bring a pattern. She went out of the shop. As soon as she was gone, a person came in, and said she had taken something. I went to a stable-yard, and found her at the top of the yard. I laid hold of her, and I immediately saw the cotton in a little area just by. She was much confused, and begged for mercy.
