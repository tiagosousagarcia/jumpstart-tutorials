I live in Petty France ; I am a blacksmith ; the clothes were in a room where M'Carthy, Brian, and Ward slept; the prisoner came to the house, and lodged two or three nights; I found my coat again; the pawnbroker had it; there were two beds in the room I slept in.
I am a bricklayer's labourer ; I lodge in Petty France; I lost two waistcoats, a coat, and breeches; I missed my breeches, and other things, on Wednesday, and found them again on Friday night.
I am a bricklayer's labourer; I lodge with Bryan and Flynn; I lost a shirt and breeches, I lost them on Wednesday; I never found them since; he confessed he stole them.
I am servant to the pawnbroker; I produce two coats; I took them in on the 16th of November, of a man who called himself John Smith ; it was about seven or eight in the evening; I cannot take upon myself to swear to the man, but I think I have seen him; I lent 7 s. on them.
The prisoner was brought to St. Giles's watch-house; we took him before a magistrate; when Bryan came, he said he had lost a razor; I searched him, and found a razor upon him.
This razor was in my coat pocket when I lost it.
On the 18th of November I took the prisoner up on suspicion of robbing these two men.
I had been to sea; I went to this lodging-house, where I had lodged a year and half before; they were very glad to see me; I know no more of it.
