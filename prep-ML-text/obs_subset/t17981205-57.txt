On the 19th of November, about half past eleven, or a quarter before twelve o'clock at night, I met the prisoner in Barbican.
What are you?
A scale-beam-maker, in Duke-street, Southwark.
Are you a maaried man?
No. The prisoner asked me to give her a glass of something, she had another person with her, and I gave her a glass at the corner of Beech-lane; she had another person with her; she went with us to a house to drink; we came out again, and she asked me if I would walk home with her; I went home with her; there was a man in the room seemed very much in liquor; the man gave some halfpence, and I gave, I believe, five-pence halfpenny to send for two pots of beer, and while the person that I met her with, whom she called her servant, went for it, I fell asleep, and I might sleep about an hour; I did not feel my money go; but when my watch went, I waked, and missed my money; I then saw Mrs. Merritt.
Did you know her before?
I have known her a long time, but whether it was her home or not I cannot tell; there was a kind of a bustle in the room, I caught hold of her, and said, you have got my watch; she said, good God, Ned, how can you think so; she sat down, and I said, return me my watch, or I will call the watchman; she said, I have not got your watch; I then called the watchman, and he came in, and searched her, but there was no watch upon her, and I have never found it.
You say there was a man in the room?
When I waked there was not.
How do you know he did not take it?
I cannot say.
