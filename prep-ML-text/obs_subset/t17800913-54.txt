I am a labourer , I live in Church-lane, Whitechapel . My wife takes in washing. I lost the things mentioned in the indictment on the 23d of August, from an out-place, a little distance from the house, in the garden.
I am a wheel-wright. I work in Church-lane. The prosecutor's house faces my garden; I got up and went to the window to see what weather it was; I saw the prisoner and another woman coming down the walk; the other woman had this bag under her right-arm; it was empty. As they walked past my house they seemed to go a-tip-toe; when they got round the house I saw them again at the back window. They went to Mr. Brown's door, and I saw the other lift up the latch of the street door; they went to the next door and tried the latch of that. They went to Mr. Batty's; there they tried the latch; it was bolted. They came back to Mr. Brown's, and the other went in at the garden door; they got into the wash-house, where these things were. The prisoner stood on the outside while the other was packing up these things; the prisoner went into the wash-house to her; I saw them both come out. I came out of the door and called out Mr. Brown, you are robbed. He did not hear me for some time; I then came out to stop them, upon which they carried the things to the place they took them from, and came back empty-handed; I stopped them and asked them if they had got any thing? They said no. They went away. A person went after them and stopped them, and they were put into Whitechapel watch-house.
I know nothing about the things more than the child unborn. This girl took me to this house and said it was her acquaintances.
To Scotcher. Was it light at this time?
Yes, I am sure the prisoner is the person.
