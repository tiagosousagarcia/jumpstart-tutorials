What are you?
A private gentleman : On Tuesday, the 25th of May, about ten minutes before two o'clock, I had my pocket picked in Fleet-street , containing a one-pound note; I was going from blackfriar's-bridge towards Temple-bar, when I felt the prisoner's hand in my pocket, nearly opposite Fetter-lane ; I immediately turned round, and saw my pocket-book in the prisoner's hand; I asked him what business he had with that pocket-book; I made a catch at him, but missed him, and he ran away from me; I crossed the street, and pursued him up Fetter-lane; I cried stop thief, and two constables took hold of him, about half-way up the lane; I never lost sight of him; when they took hold of him, he took the pocket-book from his bosom, and threw it behind him in the air; I took it up (produces it) it contained a one-pound note, and a few memorandums.
This was about two o'clock in the day?
Yes.
Are you much in London?
No.
There are a great number of people in Fleet-street, generally in the middle of the day?
Yes.
There were a great many carriages passing?
Yes, but I had my eye upon the prisoner.
You had never seen the prisoner before that day?
To the best of my knowledge, I never had.
The first time you saw any thing at all respecting the prisoner, was when he had got the pocket-book in his hand?
Yes.
Therefore any body else might have taken it out of your pocket, and delivered it to him?
I felt something, and, at the same instant, I turned round, and saw the book in the prisoner's hand.
Can you swear to the pocket-book?
Yes, it has my name in it.
I am a constable: About two o'clock, on the 25th of May, I was in company with George Donaldson; I heard the cry of stop thief, and saw the prisoner cut across Fleet-street, up Fetter-lane; I pursued him; I saw him throw away the pocket-book; I still pursued him, and took him; Mr. James picked up the book.
I know no more than the last witness.
