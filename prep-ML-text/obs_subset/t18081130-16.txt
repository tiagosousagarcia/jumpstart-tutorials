I am an haberdasher and hosier , I live in Bishopsgate street . On the 4th of the present month, between eleven and twelve in the day, I was in the shop, behind the counter: a person told me shat a woman had taken a pair of stockings from the door post; I went to the door and looked to the right, and two yards from the door I saw a woman in the act of putting a pair of stockings into her right hand pocket; I ran up to her and brought her into the shop, and perceiving the stockings had my mark on them I went for Mr. Sapwell the officer; he searched her and found another pair marked; both pair belonged to me.
I am an officer. I searched the prisoner; in her pocket I found a pair of black worsted stockings, with a private mark on them, and another air I received from the prosecutor, both black worsted stockings.
I was going by the gentleman's shop, I saw two pair of stockings lie in the street, I picked them up at the shop window, just by the door post.
