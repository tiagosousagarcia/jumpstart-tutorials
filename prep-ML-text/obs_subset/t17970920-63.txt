- I live in Bishopsgate-street ; I am linen-draper and mercer : On the 31st of August, very soon after eight o'clock in the morning, the prisoner at the bar came into the shop, and asked of the next witness to look at some things in the window; I was in the shop at the time; I left my man and her agreeing for the goods, and went backwards to my business; after a few minutes, I was called, and told that the prisoner had taken a piece of print.
Was there any body else besides yourself in the shop?
Yes, my two servants.
Any body else there?
No.
Have you any partner?
No.
Where did you find the cotton?
Under the counter.
Did not the prisoner take it off the ground, and put it on the counter?
I did not see the transaction.
- I am shopman to Mr. Nelson: On Thursday morning, August 31, about eight in the morning, the prisoner at the bar came in, and asked to look at some goods in the window; they did not give satisfaction, and the other pieces were shewn; she purchased goods to the\\ amountof 8s. 6d. the goods were put up, and two dollars presented for change; while I turned round to the till, I observed her stooping, and drawing something under her petticoats; I then went across the counter, and called to the next witness to call my master from the parlour; I then gave the prisoner one shilling in change, and she wished to go; I told her I had something further to say to her; she then pulled a piece of cotton from underneath her petticoats, and put it on the counter with the other hand; my master came up, and a constable was sent for, and she was taken into custody.
