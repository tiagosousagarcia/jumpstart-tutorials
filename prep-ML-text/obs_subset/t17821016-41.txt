About one in the afternoon, on the 14th of September, I saw the prisoner concealing a cask under a shop window, against St. Catherine's Bridge, when I returned he was gone, and the cask was put under the shelf of the window, bouge-wise on its belly; I examined the cask, and found Mr. Calvert's mark on it; I took the cask on my shoulder and was carrying it to my house, I met the prisoner at the door, and took him; I knew him by sight before; he said he was ordered by an officer to fetch that cask. I found it was taken from Mr. Calvert's wharf , the captain proved it, but he is at sea: the prisoner told different stories; I have had the cask ever since.
Have you seen the cask at the wharf?
No.
You know it from nothing but being directed for Calvert, and Co. and brand marked?
No.
I went from Mr. Nelson, a cyder merchant, to get some empty casks to go to Harrison's wharf, which were marked, and I happened to take this; I was not sober, I did not pretend to hide it; I did not take it to steal it. My master had several of the same size.
