Last Saturday, I lost two coats out of my apartments, in St. Ann's, Blackfriars ; they were found at a pawnbroker's, in Brick-lane, Spitalfields, I was not present when they were found.
I found two coats at Mr. Sowerby's, in Brick-lane, I took them to the office, and they were delivered back to the young man that took them in pledge.
I am servant to Mr. Sowerby, a pawnbroker; I took in these two coats of the prisoner for 6s.
How came you to take such articles from a woman of the appearance of the prisoner?
She uses our shop.
Do you mean to say, upon your oath, that you thought she came honestly by them?
Yes.
Remember, you are upon your oath?
Yes, I really thought so.
These are my coats.
I live with the prosecutor's son; the old man turned me out of the house last Friday night, and I could not get a lodging, we did not agree at all.
She and I had had a great many words, she had affronted me several times, and I said she should not sleep there, and she shook hands with my son, and said, good by, I shall not see you any more.
I do not think the poor wretch intended to defraud me, I believe she meant to have restored them again.
