I was coming through Stepney-fair , in the crowd
When was it?
On a Tuesday, about five o'clock in the afternoon; I selt somebody touching the slap of my trowsers; I put my hand down directly, and missed my watch; I went back about a couple of yards, and said, I had lost my watch; a Mr. Parker then pointed out the prisoner to me, and a little while after I picked up the outside case of the watch, and then the watch.
Were they near together?
I suppose they might be about half a yard from one another.
What did you do with them?
I gave them to the constable, when I gave the man in charge.
Had you seen the man about you before?
No; I cannot say I did.
Did you lose any thing else?
Yes; I lost my handkerchief from my jacket pocket; my handkerchief was found upon the prisoner.
What was your handkerchief worth?
One shilling.
I am a butcher in Newport-market; I was at Stepney-fair, and saw the prisoner there; I heard the sailor say he had lost his watch; I looked round, and saw the prisoner with the slap of his breeches down; I saw him deliver the watch to a boy, and the case dropped from him; I brought the boy back to where the sailor was, and he dropped the watch.
Are you positive as to the person of the prisoner?
Yes; I pointed him out to the sailor, and he had him apprehended.
I am an officer belonging to Lambeth-street; I searched the prisoner; he said, you have no occasion to search me, I have nothing about me; I searched in his breeches, and found this handkerchief.
I believe this handkerchief to be mine; there is no mark upon it; I lost such a one; I had the fellow to it.
I am a constable, (produces the watch;) I received it from the prosecutor.
I know my watch by the No. 10287.
There were a parcel of chaps running, and some of them dropped the watch, and they laid hold of me.
