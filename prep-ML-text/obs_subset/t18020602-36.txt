I am servant to Mr. Richard Taylor, linen-draper , at Whitehall : On the 24th of May, the prisoner came to our shop, between one and two o'clock, and asked for some linen; the handkerchiefs that were missing, were under the linen that I shewed her; there were several people in the shop who are not here.
I was sent for to Messrs. Girder's and Slaughter's, in St. Martin's-lane, to take the prisoner into custody, for stealing some bacon; when I got there they had taken the bacon from her, and the muslin, which I now produce; the shopman delivered the muslin into my custody; she told me she had it for tambour work, from No. 11, Cheapside; I went with her as far as the New Church, and then she said she had not it from there, but if I would let her have a pint of beer, she would tell me where she had it from; I let her have a pint of beer, and then she took me to Mr. Taylor's shop.
I live at Girder and Slaughter's, in St. Martin's-lane: On the 24th of May, the prisoner came in: I asked her what she was looking for; she made me no reply; in consequence of information, I took some bacon from under her apron; and, in feeling for the bacon, I discovered a piece of muslin; I took it from the prisoner, and detained her.
I found the muslin on the ground. GUILTY, aged 49.
