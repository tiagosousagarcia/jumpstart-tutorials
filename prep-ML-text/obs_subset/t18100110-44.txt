I am a helper to a coachman in Mr. Gibbs's Yard, in Mount-street . On the 12th of December, I missed the coat from the stable. I had suspicion of the prisoner. I apprehended him in the yard the next morning.
On the 13th of December, I was in Coventry-street, in the Haymarket; the prisoner was on the opposite side of the way, with some clothes on his arm, he beckoned me to come over to him. I bought the clothes of him; for two pound twelve shillings. I am certain that is the man.
I am a constable; I apprehended the prisoner on the 13th, and I received this coat of the jew.
