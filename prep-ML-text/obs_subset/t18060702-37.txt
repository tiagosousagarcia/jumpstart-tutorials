I live in New Gravel-lane . On the 12th of June I lost a parcel of old iron and a nailing tool out of my workshop, I had locked the door to the best of my knowledge, and carried the key to my wife, in case she should want it; the next morning, between three and four o'clock, I was alarmed by two watchmen, I went to my shop and found the shop door unlocked, the lock was hanging on the staple, the lock had been picked.
I am a waterman. On the 12th of June about three o'clock in the morning, I was going home after I had been watching the craft, and coming across the Dock Road that leads to New Gravel lane, I saw this man come from the back of the premises with a white bag on his shoulder, he went about forty yards from Leggett's shop, I told the watchman that I had suspicion that it was linen; the watchman called to Jones, another watchman, the first watchman and me went and overhauled the bag, and we found it was iron, we brought him back to Mr. Leggett's place, the prisoner said he found the door open and he went in; we took him to the watchhouse, the officer had the charge of the prisoner and the iron.
I was sent for to take the prisoner in custody; I produce the property, it was delivered to me by the watchman.
I am a watchman, I took up the prisoner, he had a white bag at his back, the waterman came up and took the bag from him, we found it contained iron, we took him back to Leggett's shop and called him up, and then took him to the watchhouse; we found the shop door broken open, the prisoner said he found the lock hanging on the door.
I told him I found the bag as I was walking along, they never a one of them saw me in the place, nor can they say they saw me steal it.
