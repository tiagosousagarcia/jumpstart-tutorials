I am a post boy , I drive for Mr. Newman, Great Windmill street.
Did you lose two coats and a silk handkerchief at any time.
Yes, on the 27th of December they were in the stable; I had just come home with my horses, I pulled off my two coats to light a candle, and when I returned to put my horses up they were gone.
Did you see who took them.
I saw a man go from the stable, and he acknowledged it was him on the Monday following at the watchhouse.
I work in the same yard with Fay, we came home together, I saw a man run across the yard, I pursued him, and lost him; I saw the prisoner in the watchhouse, I asked him if he knew any thing about the coats, to tell me, as I had lost three coats before, and I had never a one to put on.
I am a pawnbroker.
Do you know the prisoner.
On the 29th of December he pledged a great coat for a guinea, and a coat and handkerchief.
I took the man in custody on the 29th of December last, at the Turk's Head in Dyot street; I told him I apprehended him for stealing these coats of these people, I took him to the watchhouse, I searched him, I could find no tickets; I found a knife that one of them says belong to one of them; I went to the pawnbroker's and found the property,
