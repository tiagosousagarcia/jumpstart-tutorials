On the 21st of October last I met the prisoner in the street, and upon my looking at him, he\\ ran\\ away; I am waiter at the Blue-posts, Russel-street, Covent-Garden; I pursued him, and took him; he asked me what he had done; I told him I would let him know another time what he had done, it was of no consequence; I then brought him down to Carpmeal's, in Bow-street, and from there to Covent-Garden watch-house; on the 22d I took him before the Magistrates at Bow-street, where I charged him with felony, in consequence of which he was committed.
Had you ever seen him before?
Yes; I took him not for this particularly, but for other things.
I am servant to Mr. Kirby, (produces a copy of the prisoner's conviction) I had it from Mr. Shelton's office,(it is read); I attended the bar at the time he was convicted; I know his person perfectly well; I was likewise at the delivery of him at Woolwich, with Mr. Kirby.
He was delivered on board the hulk on the 2d of November, and escaped the 23d of July last.
What character did I bear while I was on board the hulk?
He coaducted himself very properly.
