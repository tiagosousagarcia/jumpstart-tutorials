I am in partnership with Thomas Clarke , linen-draper , in High-Holborn; the prisoner had been our porter about two months: On Saturday, the 15th of May, I taxed him with offering a piece of linen for sale, in the Borough, the Sunday before; he denied it; I told him all the circumstances under which he had offered it, and Mr. Clarke then said, he would send for a constable, and went down stairs; the prisoner went with me to the warehouse, and said, if it had not been for one d-d rogue, that never would have happened.
What did you understand by that?
Being taxed with stealing the cloth, he then said, he had taken a piece of Irish cloth from the lower warehouse, we were then in the upper warehouse; he said the mark was D. Y. and that he had carried it to his brother's, he said, that was all he had taken; we then sent for a constable, and I went to his brother's house, there I found a piece of nankeen, a remnant of white calico, and a calico wrapper; I knew them to be our property.
I believe you had a very excellent character with the prisoner?
I never had a better character with any servant.
Do you know if his friends are respectable?
I believe they are.
