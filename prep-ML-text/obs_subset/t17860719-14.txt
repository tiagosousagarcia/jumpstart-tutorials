I was going to Mr. Jennour's on Tuesday the 4th of this month; I saw the prisoner lift a prickle basket upon his shoulder; I saw some wine on the ground, and knowing Mr. Jennour had a fresh pipe of wine in, I asked him what he had in his basket, he said, nothing, he then pitched the basket on the outside of the door.
What had he in the basket?
Upon searching the basket I found eleven bottles of wine, and one broke and the wine running about.
How far was you from the prisoner?
About a yard.
Was his face from the house or towards it?
From it, he was in liquor at the time; he was reeling.
He had not quitted the door?
No.
On the 4th of July, about seven o'clock coming down Dean's-court I observed the prisoner coming up the steps from the kitchen; he let the basket fall, he was very much intoxicated; upon further enquiry we found it was wine, one of the bottles was broke, and the wine running about; just before the prisoner said, they were empty bottles, and was going away with them; Mr. Fenton insisted upon his putting the basket down again, and on searching it, we found it was red port containing twelve bottles, one of which was broke.
I live with Mr. Jennour; I saw the prisoner stow the wine in the cellar with another man.
Was any other of Mr. Jennour's servants with the man?
Only myself.
Did not you see one of the men asleep on the floor?
I did not.
Who let them out?
I opened the gate for them.
