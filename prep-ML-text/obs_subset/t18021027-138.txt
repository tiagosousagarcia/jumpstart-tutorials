I live at No. 22, New-street, St. Catherine's ; the prisoner is a waterman ; I little suspected Mr. Goodwin had taken my shirt; I found it in his custody.
Is it your shift or Riley's?
It is my shift; it is Riley's house; it was under the counter: I had not had time to finish it, there was one sleeve wanting when I lost it, and when I found it there had been a sleeve put in.
On the 26th of October Mrs. Hurley came to the office in Lambeth-street and said she had been robbed, a warrant was granted, and I went with her to Goodwin's house, and on searching the house, in the bottom drawer, I found this shift, which she said was her's.
You got the keys from the prisoner's wife?
Yes.
I am a waterman and lighterman, and lodge in the prisoner's house; I know nothing further than what I heard the wife say.
