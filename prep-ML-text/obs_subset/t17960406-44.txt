I am very much afflicted with fits, I am a shoemaker ; and as I was sitting at work, eleven weeks ago to-day, I sell in a fit; I rented a room at Staines , the watch was hung up in the room, the prisoner was coming by at the time, and came in to assist me; I was not sensible when he came into the room; he called Mr. Gregory in to assist me, and as soon as I recovered, I found my watch was gone and he was gone out of the room; the prisoner lived with his father, in the town; I went and asked him if he had seen any thing of the watch? he asked me if I had lost mine? he said he should know mine from a hundred.
Did you ever see your watch again?
Yes; about seven weeks ago.
You never saw the prisoner in your room?
No.
He is a very decent lad in the town?
Yes; I never heard any thing against him.
I was in the last witnesses room in the month of January, when he was in a sit; I was standing at my own door; when the prisoner called to me to assist the prosecutor, he was standing at the prosecutor's door; I went over, and found the prisoner in the room; we staid, there about a quarter of an hour, till the prosecutor recovered; I went out first and left the prisoner there.
You know the lad and his father?
Perfectly well.
He bore a very good character?
Yes; his father is a carpenter and joiner.
Is the lad brought up to any prosession?
I believe he has been a little in the carpentering line.(The watch was produced in Court by the constable).
I bought this watch from the prisoner at the bar, about the beginning of February, I gave him fifteen shillings for it; I know his father, I cannot say I know him; as soon as I had any idea of its being the property of this man, I went to his father about it.
This is my watch; here is a mark upon the glass, and it is loose all round, and almost coming out.
