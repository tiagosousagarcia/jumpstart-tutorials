I employed the prisoner to work for me, I am a taylor ; the 6th of August, Monday, I lost a coat and watch; I am a lodger, I went out about ten, and returned a quarter after; I had left the prisoner in my room, on my return he was gone, and my door locked; I wandered about till four o'clock, then I broke open the door, and discovered the coat and watch to be gone; I found the watch at the pawnbroker's, the coat he sold.
I am a constable in St. John's-lane; on the 14th of August the prisoner was brought into the watch-house, I searched him, and he told me the duplicate was at his lodgings; I found it there.
I am a pawnbroker; I produce a silver watch, I took it in of the prisoner about eleven or twelve in the forenoon, on the 8th of August; he came and he had more money on it.
I only know of taking him into custody.
I have but little to say in my defence, my Lord; I have been guilty of some follies, but I never before violated the laws of my country, there I humbly throw myself on the mercy of the court.
