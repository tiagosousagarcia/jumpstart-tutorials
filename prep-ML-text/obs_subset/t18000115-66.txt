live in Tower-street : On Wednesday, the 8th of January, I went out about half past three o'clock, and left the property standing at the door; I came home at ten, and was informed that one of the kegs was stolen.
I am son of the last witness: There were a great quantity of kegs hanging up outside the door; the prisoner coming by, took up one of them and went away with it, and went as far as Mincing-lane with it; I did not see him take it, but I saw him with it upon his shoulder in Mincing-lane, I was in pursuit of him; I had been informed that he had taken one of the kegs; I asked him where he was going with it; he said he did not know where he was going; he begged my pardon, and said he was in liquor.
Did he appear to be in liquor?
I thought rather so.
Did not he appear to know what he was about at all?
No; I sent for a constable, and our lad carried the keg back to our house, I was with him at the time; the constable has got it.
I believe you know Mr. Church?
Yes.
He is the master of the man now accused?
Yes.
Do you think, if the man had not been drunk he would have done this?
That I cannot say.
He seemed to know very little of what he was about?
He seemed to be in liquor I must own.
I am servant to Mr. Graves, a glazier: I saw a man take a keg from Mr. Lambert's door; but I did not take any notice of his person; he let the keg fall close to my feet, just by Mr. Lambert's door; he then went up Mincing-lane, and I went about my business; I cannot say that the prisoner is the man.
I am a constable(
I am a sugarcooper, No. 203, Upper Thames-street: The day that the prisoner was taken up, he was in my service; he had lived about five years in my service; I had trusted him very largely; I do not think I ever had an honester servant; I have known him sixteen years; if he should be discharged, I would take him into my service again, and trust him as largely as I have done before.
