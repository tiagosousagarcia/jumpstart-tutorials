I am a labourer to Messrs. Warners: On the 6th of August I was at work in the shop about eight o'clock in the evening, when the prisoner went through the shop soon afterwards, and Mr. Robert Warner called out for me; I went, and he gave me two pieces of copper into my hand, which he said he had taken out of the prisoner's pocket; the prisoner was present, but did not make any reply; Messrs. Warners are all Quakers: a constable was sent for, and he asked the prisoner if that was all; he then put his hand into his pocket and gave me two more pieces out of his left-hand pocket; they were delivered to the constable; I marked them in the presence of Fairclough and Mr. Robert Warner .(The constable produced the property.)
I cannot swear to the property.
I have not any body to speak for me.
