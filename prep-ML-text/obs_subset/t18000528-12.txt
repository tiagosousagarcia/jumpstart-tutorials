I am journeyman to Mr. William Fairbrother , cheesemonger ; On the 22d of April, about two o'clock, the prisoner came into the shop and talked to the porter, and directly as the porter turned his back, he took a piece of beef from off a butter-slat, and put it under his coat, and walked away with it; I went after him, he went round the horses' heads of a hackney-coach, and dropped the beef; he ran across the way, and I stopped him; the beef was picked up by a boy, and taken to the Magistrates; I am sure the prisoner is the same man.
If you saw me take it, why did not you stop me?
Because I could not get round the counter quick enough.
What kind of beef was it?
Salt beef; he had been in the shop before in a kind of a drunken way.
I know nothing more about it than a child unborn.
