I am a chimney sweeper , and the prisoner is a chimney sweeper; the prisoner had slept with me for four or five nights, and on Monday morning he got up about three o'clock, he said he was going to call his master; we told him it was too soon: we happened to drop off to sleep again, and when we got up he was gone and all the doors open, and the watch with him.
Where was the watch
In my hat on the shelf.
Did you ever find your watch again
Yes.
How old are you
Seventeen.
How old is he
Fifteen.
Did he work for the same master as you
No.
How came he to lay in the same room with you
I was out of place; he lived in the place, and I only slept there.
I am a boot and shoemaker, I live at No. 18, Green Arbour court, Old Bailey; I have known the prisoner better than two years. On the 13th of November, about five o'clock in the evening, he sent my son to me to say that he had won a watch at a raffle; he came down afterwards to me in my own room, he asked me if I wanted to buy one; I told him no; he went, and returned with my son and said if I wanted to buy one I should have it for eighteen shillings; I then asked him how he came by it, he said he won it at a raffle; I asked him if he was sure of it, he said yes; I then asked him if he was quite sure of it, he said yes. I sent him and my son together to his master and mistress, to ask them if they were agreeable for me to buy the watch; they returned and answered that his mistress did not care what he did with it, he might throw it in the channel. After asking him if he came honestly by it, I paid him the eighteen shillings for it, and desired him to give it to his mistress to lay it out in clothes upon him; he said they owed him six shillings before, he knew better what to do with the money.
I am an officer. When I had the lad in custody he said he had sold it to one Mackay; it was a silver watch. I went to Mackey, he gave me the watch.
