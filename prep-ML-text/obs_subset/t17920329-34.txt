On the 15th of this month we lost some linen, six shirts, two shifts, four neck handkerchiefs, one dozen pocket handkerchiefs, and a towel; I had taken them in to wash; I had seen them at half past seven, and missed them in five minutes after; they were in a front room on the ground floor; I was going to take my clothes in that were hung up to dry; the window of the fore room was pushed up, and the things taken off a table; I saw the things at Mr. Staples's on the 16th of March.
I am a headborough. On the 15th of this month, between the hours of seven and eight in the evening, I stopped the prisoner at the bar with this property; I stopped him in Whitechapel, within two hundred yards of the house.
