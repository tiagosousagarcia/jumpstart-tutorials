- I keep the King's Arms Inn, Leadenhall-street : On Friday the 14th of November last, I was called up early in the morning, and informed, that the stranger that I had taken in over night, had robbed my house; when I came down, I found the prisoner in the custody of the constable, with a pair of sheets in a bundle, in the possession of my servant, who has them here.
I attended in the chamber-maid's place: On Thursday night the 13th of November, I lighted the prisoner to bed; I am sure he is the man; I never saw him before, to my knowledge; he had no bundle when he went to bed; I was going up to bed at half past seven in the morning, and saw him with a bundle; I immediately went to look at the bed that I had made up for him, and missed the sheets; I then called to the ostler to stop him, which he did; he had the sheets, one in each pocket, and the counterpane in a bundle; the counterpane was taken off another bed in the same room; I know them to be my master's property; one of the sheets was marked with a single W, and the other with WW and an E.
I am ostler at the King's Arms, Leadenhall-street: The last witness called to me; I immediately followed the prisoner, and stopped him, and brought him back; I took him into the tap-room, and there I took the sheets, one out of each pocket, and a counterpane tied up in a handkerchief in his hand; I fetched a constable, and he was secured. (The property was produced and deposed to by Elizabeth Martin ).
I have nothing to say; I have no friends. GUILTY , aged 24. - Confined six months in Newgate , and publicly whipped .
