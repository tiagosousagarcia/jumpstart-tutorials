On Sunday the 6th of March, about six in the evening, I went to a house that I was building, in Nottingham-street , and heard a noise at the top of the house, as if there were a great many people there; one of the witnesses took the prisoner coming out of the house; the lead was left at the top of the house; I did not go up to look till next morning, and then I missed the lead.
I am clerk to Mr. Agar; I took the prisoner at the door coming out of the house, on Sunday the 6th of March, without any shoes; his hands were quite black, apparently as if he had been handling lead; he told me he had been drinking, and taking a girl home, and the girl had run into that house, and he had been in after her; I asked him where the girl was? and he said he did not know; he was then taken to the watch-house.
I am a patrole of Mary-le-bonne watch-house: On the 6th of March, between six and seven o'clock, I took charge of the prisoner; he had no shoes on, his hands were very dirty, as if he had been taking lead; I searched him, but did not find any thing upon him; the next morning, about nine o'clock, I went to the house, and found the lead there, it was delivered to me, and I marked it; I put the lead down, and it sitted the place exactly, at the end of the gutter, but there was a great deal gone.
I am a carpenter: On Sunday evening, as I was coming past, I heard a great noise; I called and asked if they were pulling the house to pieces; and then the noise ceased; I came past again a few minutes after, and I heard the same rending again; and I went to Mr. Williams's to inform him of it; I did not see the prisoner come out, but I saw him close by the corner when he was stopped.
Who was it that found the lead and shoes there?
A person who is not here; I don't know his name, he is a stranger to me.
