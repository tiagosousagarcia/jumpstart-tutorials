I live at the Roebuck, at Tottenham : Last Monday was month I went up to my room at breakfast time, and my shirt was then lying upon a box; and when I went up at dinner time it was gone; I went down into the tap-room, and said I had lost my shirt; a countryman of my landlord's said, he had seen the prisoner in my room; I did not hear any thing more of it till last Wednesday night; there was a shirt gone of another lodger's and I heard he had sold it to one Gilbin, and I got a warrant and I took him up with the shirt upon his back.
I am a labouring-man; I was taken up by the prosecutor yesterday morning, for stealing a shirt I had on; I bought it of William Rea three weeks ago last Sunday; he told me it was his own.
This is my shirt; here is W.B. upon it.
The shirt was given to me by Mr. Nixon; and I was in distress, and sold it to that man.
