I am a leather-seller , in Bride-lane, Fleet-street , in partnership with Elizabeth Avery , widow .
Do you know the prisoner at the bar?
I did not know him before this transaction; he came to my house on the 6th of June , and told me he wanted some morocco skins for Mr. Jackson, upholsterer, of Jewin-street, for chair seats; I asked him, if he had a written order, he said, no; I then asked him, if he knew Mr. Lamb, clerk to Mr. Jackson; he said, he knew Mr. Lamb, that he had left Mr. Jackson, and kept a shop in Jewin-street; he said his name was Simpson; I let him have six morocco skins.
Was Mr. Jackson a customer of your's?
Yes.
If he had not said he came from Mr. Jackson, should you have let him have them?
No; he came a second time, and I took him up.
What is the value of these skins?
Two pounds eighteen shillings, he had a bill of parcels with them.
Are you a customer of Mr. West's?
A little customer.
Did you ever send for goods to his house?
No; I do not know that I ever did, upon any occasion; if I wanted any thing, I always order it myself: Mr. West never sold me any thing but nine green morocco skins, about two months ago.
On the 6th of June, did you send to him for any skins?
No.
Did you send the prisoner for any skins?
Never in my life; he worked for me about three years ago as an upholsterer.
