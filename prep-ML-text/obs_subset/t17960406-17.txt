I am a Calico-glazer , in Bartholomew-close : On the 2d of March, I lost a piece of printed calico; I had seen it there about nine o'clock in the morning, I missed it immediately after; I don't know any thing of it myself.
I was in the kitchen getting my breakfast, and I saw the prisoner go several times to the door, and look in at the window; the kitchen is down stairs opposite the shop; and he got over the shop-window, and took the piece out, it lay at a very little distance from the window; I went up from my breakfast directly, and caught him with the piece under his great coat.
I am a constable, (produces the property,) I received it from the last witness.
This is the piece I took from the prisoner.
I know this to be my property.
Is not there somebody in the business with you; has not your son some share in the business?
No, nobody at all.
