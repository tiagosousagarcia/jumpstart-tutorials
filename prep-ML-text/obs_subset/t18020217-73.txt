I am a nightman , and live at Whitechapel ; the prisoner was a servant of mine, and I had great reason to suspect her honesty, as my clerk had lost his pocket-book; on the Sunday following she asked me to go out, which I granted; when she was gone, my clerk and I broke open her room, and the first thing we saw was his pocket-book, which she had declared she knew nothing of; I also found a pocket-book belonging to her, which contained a great number of duplicates, and which I examined; I suspected some sheets were gone, and searched the bed; I discovered they were gone, and the quilt and table-cloth also, which, she said, were gone to the mangler's; when she came home, I gave charge of her; the officer asked her what she did it for, and she said, she never could get her wages of me, but it was no such thing; I was to give her eight pounds a year; she had lived with me exactly six months, and I had paid her three guineas; I went to the pawnbroker's, and found the things.
I am a pawnbroker, and produce two sheets, a table-cloth, and a counterpane, which were pawned by the prisoner at the bar. (The property produced and sworn to).
