- I live at No. 8, Mansell-street : The bar that fastened the shutters, about six feet long, lay in the passage; I had been out on the 26th of July, and met my servant, Mary East, who told me a woman had run away with it to Rosemary-lane; I went there, and saw the prisoner offering it for sale; my servant is not here.
