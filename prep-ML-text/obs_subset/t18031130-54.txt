I lodge at the Lamb, in Fulwood's-rents; I am a soldier : On the 18th of November, rather before twelve o'clock in the day, I lost my pocket-book and pencil at the bottom of Ludgate-hill ; my comrade and I were looking in at a picture-shop; I had been there but a little while; I was turning to come home; I put my hand to my side; my comrade asked me if I had lost my pocket-book; I told him I had; he then pointed out the prisoner to me; we immediately went after the man, and as soon as we overtook him, the boy said, in the prisoner's hearing, that is the man that has got your pocketbook, I saw him take it out of your pocket; he immediately put his hand to his pocket, and threw it into a carpenter's shop, turning the corner towards Fleet-market; my comrade took him by the collar; the boy took the book out of the shop, and gave it to me; he was then taken to Guildhall, and committed; I am sure I saw him throw the pocket-book out of his pocket (produces it) it is my pocket-book.
I am a soldier, I was with the last witness; coming down Ludgate-hill, on the 18th of November, we stopped about five minutes at a picture-shop; as he turned to go away, he put his hand to his side, and said, he had lost his pocket-book; a boy came up at the same time, and informed us the prisoner at the bar had taken the book out of his pocket; the boy pointed to him; I was going up to take him by the collar, when he pulled the book out of his pocket, and threw it into the carpenter's shop; we then took him to Guildhall.
I never was within thirty or forty yards of the men; there was another man on one side of me, who ran away.
