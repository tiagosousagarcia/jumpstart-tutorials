I am porter to Messrs. Pickford; I know the prisoner at the bar, and have employed him; as I was coming to the warehouse, at the corner of Maiden-lane, about six o'clock, I observed a man resting himself, with a bag of cotton, against the church-yard; he took it up, and went through Bell-square; he stopped there, at the sign of the Bell; I said, Tom, where are you going with this bag of cotton? I turned it, and found it was like some bags we had in the yard; he said he was employed by a man in Watling-street; I said, go and fetch him; I carried him to the watch-house.
His business was that of a jobbing porter?
Yes.
I am a watchman; I saw the prisoner pitch the cotton off his shoulder, at the Bell, in Bell-square.
I am clerk to Mr. Thomas Pickford : on the 14th I entered 12 bags of cotton; they were marked regularly W. from 1 to 12; this bag was No. 12, and corresponded to the loss of one of the twelve; we went after Whittle to his lodging; we were refused admission; we broke open the door.
I leave it to my counsel.
I know the prisoner as a jobbing porter: he is a very honest man.
I have known the prisoner for the last seven years; his general reputation is that of an honest, hard-working man.
