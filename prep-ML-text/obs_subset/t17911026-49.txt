I am a gardener ; on Sunday, the 16th, I was going up Hedge-lane , I was accosted by the prisoner at the bar; she put her hand into mine, and asked for some gin; I refused; she walked by my side, she felt about my pockets, and took my watch; two more came up and hustled me; I got hold of the chain and key; they then struck me, the prisoner at the bar struck me in the nose, which bled; she held me, and was on my right hand-side, she was close to me, her left hand was to my right hand. I had still hold of my watch chain, we had a struggle, she broke the watch away from the chain, I had my hand upon it in my pocket or fob, and she pulled my hand out, in which I held the watch: the watch separated from the chain at the swivel by which it hung to the chain; she did not take the chain. The constable has the watch. I lost three shillings; the constable came up, I discovered I had lost my handkerchief, he secured her. I believe the watch was found upon her, it was in the evening.
I was constable last year, I was sent for about eight o'clock, when I came up the prosecutor said he had been robbed; I was going to take her to the watch-house, when I moved her I found the watch lying on the ground. I could not see it till I moved her. The prosecutor said I have been robbed; I desired him to wipe his face, it was bloody. My nephew said, here is the watch, uncle.
On Sunday evening as I was coming up Hedge-lane, with tobacco in my hand, this gentleman was calling out watch, and said he had lost his watch. The constable's nephew found the watch. The man put his hand into my bosom, and seized me, he said I was the person who robbed him.
