On the 2d of January, I was alarmed on the cry of stop thief; I descended into the warehouse; my servant and another person had stopped the prisoner with two pieces of Manchester cotton, which were laying on the counter with ten other pieces; they were laying in three heaps, four pieces in a heap.
At past three o'clock on the 2d of January, I had been to Budge-row, and as I came back I saw the prisoner standing facing the gateway, with a white apron like a porter, and I suspected he was a thief; I watched him for five minutes, and I saw him cross over to Mr. Wyatt's, and presently I saw him come out with two pieces of goods; I saw him beckon to the other man who I suspected to be an accomplice, who immediately went off; I walked after the prisoner, and called out stop thief; he was stopped with the goods under his arms, about a dozen doors from Mr. Wyatt's.
I am a porter; I stopped the prisoner with the goods; I took the prisoner and goods to Mr. Wyatt's.
I am clerk to Mr. Wyatt; I was up at dinner at the time the robbery was committed; upon the cry of stop thief, I ran down stairs as fast as I could; I missed the two pieces from off the counter; I went out immediately and picked up one piece, and Payne the other; they were dropped by the prisoner when Payne stopped him.
I am a constable; I know nothing only taking charge of the prisoner.
I was standing close by the gateway, and a man dressed like a porter asked me to carry two pieces of cotton a little way for him, and he would give me sixpence, and the man stopped me; they dropped out of my hand.
