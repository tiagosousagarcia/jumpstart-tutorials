I am a stay-maker , No. 19, Plumptree-street, Bloomsbury : On the 26th of December, about half past seven o'clock in the evening, I was sitting in the parlour, I heard a pane of glass break; I got up, and went into the shop as quick as I possibly could, I saw a man pull a pair of stays through a hold in the window; I then made to the street-door as quick-as I could, I went down the street a little way, and saw the prisoner with another man, my son had got the prisoner in custody; the prisoner said he did not know any thing of it.
I heard the square of glass break twice; I went out and pursued, and found the prisoner in the hands of Brewer; I saw the stays lying at the prisoner's feet.
I was coming along the street, going to Oxford-road, I was running, and saw one man break the window and take a pair of stays, and then I saw the prisoner take another pair of stays, and I seized him, with the stays upon him.
I know these to be my stays, I made them; I lost two pair.
I was coming from my sister's in Bloomsbury-market, I had a stick in my hand, I saw a man break the window and take out a pair of stays; I made a blow at him with the stick, and knocked the stays out of his hand; that was the way they came to be at my feet, and this man laid hold of me immediately.
