I live at No. 1, Bateman's-row, Shoreditch , a pawnbroker and silversmith . I lost this handkerchief from my door; I was told that a person had taken it; it was the 22d of last month; and I ran out of doors, and I found it on the prisoner at the bar, about thirty feet from the door; I immediately took it from her, it was in her bosom.
Do you know whether that is your handkerchief?
Yes, it was hanging at my door half an hour before, I see it myself; there is no mark on it, no more than it is the same kind of pattern, and the same kind of silk, rather a reddish silk, it was hanging at the door, on a line.
I picked up the handkerchief about five yards from the door.
