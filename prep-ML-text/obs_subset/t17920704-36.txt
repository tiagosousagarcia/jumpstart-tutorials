I carry on business for John Carter ; the boots were missed from the window; a person came in and asked me if I missed any boots; I said yes, I missed two, or a pair; the constable brought the prisoner into the shop, who seemed unconcerned, and I said, it is a pity you have no better method of living than by stealing.
I am servant to a pawnbroker; I took in these boots, and from the appearance of the man, and being odd boots, I stopped him, and sent for an officer.
I took the prisoner and have kept the boots ever since.
I hope you will forgive me.
