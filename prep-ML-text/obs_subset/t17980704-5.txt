I am a brewer's servant : On the 9th of June, between four and five in the afternoon; I was in my master's business, in Dyot-street, St. Giles's , I stood by the door of the chandler's shop, I served the house with beer; the prisoner at the bar sat at the door with another woman with her, and she picked my right hand pocket, part of the property was found upon her.
How soon did you miss it?
When I got to St. Giles's church, or thereabouts, I missed near 2l. it was all in a purse; the last time I had seen it, was, in St. John's-street, about a quarter of an hour before; there were two seven shilling pieces, and the rest in silver, mostly shillings; I knew, as soon as I missed it, that she had taken it from me; when I came back and went to the house, she was gone, and the woman that was along with her; the other woman was not so near my pocket as the prisoner; I found one shilling upon the prisoner, that I can swear to, about nine o'clock at night; I told her, she was the woman that robbed me, she said, not; then the constable was sent for, and she was searched; when I saw her first, she was very meanly dressed, and when I saw her afterwards, she was very finely dressed.
I am an officer of Marlborough-street; I searched the prisoner, and found a shilling upon her.
This shilling I can swear to, I had it from the accompting-house that morning, I had taken it the day before; I knew it by its being a bad shilling, with a notch in it.
Who was the person that was talking with you?
A woman that I was talking to about my master's business; the woman that was with the prisoner was bound over, but we have not been able to find her since, her name is Mary Williams .
