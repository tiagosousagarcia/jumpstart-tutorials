I am a victualler , in Gray's-inn-lane ; I lost my money, on the 15th of January; six guineas out of a little box in a chest of drawers, which stood in the one pair of stairs where I lay; I saw the money that very morning about twelve; I put a guinea or two to it out of my pocket, which caused me to see it; I missed it the next day; I never found it again; the prisoner came to me as a servant, the 2d of January, and she left me on the 15th; she never had any wages, nor returned again till the 3d of March; then she came to me and cried, and acknowledged the fact; I made enquiry for three or four days, and I thought no more about it; I did not want to see her any more; then she came to acknowledge it, then I thought it best to take her up.
Did she restore you any part of the money?
No.
What account did she give you of it?
She said, she had spent it, and bought herself some gowns and shifts.
I am not guilty; my father sent to him, and offered him two guineas in part, when he heard of my being in prison; he said he would not take it, but he would take four; and if I would put it into a place, he would come into Court, and tell them it was mislaid.
Did you say any thing of that kind?
No, I did not; her father applied to my daughter, and she said I might make it as easy as I could, if she could return any part of the money.
