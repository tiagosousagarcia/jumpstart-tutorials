I lost my great coat about eight in the evening, the 5th of October, setting down a gentleman, I am a hackney coachman ; I missed it instantly, and a good looking man told me the man was gone towards St. Giles's. I drove down to King-street, St. Giles's, but I saw nothing of this gentleman or of the property: I understood the patrol had taken the prisoner.
I am a patrol, I took the prisoner into custody, and the coat on his arm, he said he was going to drive all night.
