Coming down Winfield-street , the 25th of this month, about twelve on Saturday night, this girl took my hat off, and put it on her head; I asked her for it, she run away, she run into her lodgings in George-street, Spitalfields; she said if I gave her a shilling she would give me my hat. I gave her a shilling, she threw the hat on the stairs, and after that she took it up into the garret. I went up into a room where there was seven or eight beds, and as many men, they appeared to be asleep. I asked her for my hat, she said if I gave her a glass of gin; I refused. She throwed me on the bed, and took 2 s. 6 d. out of my pocket. I was very sober, I had been to the opera. She ran down stairs; I went out, I met a man I knew; he advised me to go to the patrol, who took her.
I am a patrol, I went to the house, and took her.
I never saw the man before he came into my room with the patrol, he took me half undressed.
