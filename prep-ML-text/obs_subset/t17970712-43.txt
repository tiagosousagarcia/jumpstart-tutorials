I am one of the Elders of the East-India Company's Warehouse: I was standing in the yard belonging to the warehouses, in Haydon-square ; on the 27th of June, I saw the prisoner pass me; as he passed me, I observed a large bundle under his coat behind, I went and called a King's officer, Mr. Booth; when I came in with Mr. Booth, the prisoner took a bag from under his coat, containing green-tea.
After Mr. Joyce challenged the prisoner with it, he took it out, and said it was tea, he did not say where he got it from.
I am a King's officer; I had this parcel of tea from the prisoner.
