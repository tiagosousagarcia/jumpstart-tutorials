- I am a dyer , and live in the City-road, St. Luke's : On the 15th of December last I lost a large copper, with a broad rim, which cost me six pounds, and was fixed in a sned separate from the dwelling house, to which shed there was no fastening; in the morning, when we got up to go to work, the copper was gone, and the brick work, in which it was set, was partly pulled down.
I am a patrol; about four o'clock, on the morning of the 16th of December the prisoner and another man passed me, and went towards the prosecutor's; as I was going my rounds again, about half past five, I heard a noise, and saw the prisoner with a copper on his head, and a hank of silk in a small bag; I asked him how he came by them, he made no answer, but threw the copper down, and attempted to run away; I caught him by the collar, and we had a scuffle, in which he knocked my blunderbuss out of my hand; I got it up again, and told him I would fire upon him if he resisted; he then begged for mercy, and I sprung my rattle, at which a watchman came up; I asked the prisoner how he came by the property; he said, as he was coming along a man hired him to carry it to Old-street, for which he was to have 2s. but did not know who the man was, where it came from, or where he was to take it to; he was then taken to the watch-house.
Did you not ask me what man run away from me?
No; one was with you then, there was at four o'clock.( William Lewis , the watchman, corroborated the testimony of the last witness, as to taking the prisoner to the watch-house.)(The property produced and identified.)
I was employed to carry the copper to Old-street, and was to have 2s. I never saw the silk. GUILTY, aged 24.
