I am the wife of James Driver . On Saturday, the 16th of January, the prisoner came to the room, about eleven in the morning; over the stable; I gave him a glass of liquor to drink; he hath been a servant , and is a relation; I left him and went backwards; he called to me, and said, he was going; I went to look what it was o'clock, and missed the watch, which hung up by the fire side; I went to a corner cupboard, and missed four tea spoons and sugar tongs; I have seen them at Hickes's-hall; on the Monday following the pawnbroker carried them there.
This poor creature is a relation of your's?
Yes, he is; I always thought him a very honest creature before this.
The prisoner brought this watch the 16th of January to our house; I lent him eighteen shillings on it; and with the money he took out some wearing apparel.
I produce four spoons and one pair of tongs, pledged with me for eight shillings.
