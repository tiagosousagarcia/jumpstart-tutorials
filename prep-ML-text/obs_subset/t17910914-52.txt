I live in Wood-street . Mr. George Goodger and William Standridge are my partners. This man lived with us fifteen months, about two months prior to this, my partner was rendered uneasy. My partner was going out of town, I suspected the prisoner from his caution. I desired my apprentices to watch the prisoner; the 27th he stayed out all night; I went up to his box, and, with the constable, searched his box; we all went up stairs together; I desired the prisoner to open his box, it was locked; he opened it, and in taking it out we found several blocks, we found four parts of half pieces of ribbon, which he confessed were our property; I had not made him any promises. During the time he lived with us I had a very high opinion of him; he said they were our property, but he had never taken any thing else.
I am an apprentice to the prosecutor, on the night on which he, the prisoner, slept out, I, on passing his room door in the morning, saw his box open, I looked into and saw several blocks; I acquainted the prosecutor as soon as he came to town, and he was apprehended.
I searched the prisoner's box, and found some ribbon. (Produces them.)
I cannot swear to them.
The prisoner lived with me two years from March 1788, to March 1790; during the time he lived with me he was sober, honest, and punctual.
