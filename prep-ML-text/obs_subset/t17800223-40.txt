I am an apothecary . I missed a silver salve-box on the 12th of this month, out of my shop or parlour. I had it out with me on the 10th. When I came home on Saturday the 12th in the forenoon, one Matthews came and asked if I had lost my salve-box. I looked in the place where it was generally kept, and missed it. I went to the Rotation Office, where Matthews produced the box. The prisoner was at the office.
What passed there?
I could only say that it was my property.
On the 11th of this month, I was called up by a lodger of mine, and told that they had found this box in the hampers belonging to the prisoner. He goes out with apples in hampers on an ass, and sells them for me. I received it from one of the witnesses.
On the 11th of this month I was in a young woman's room in the house of Matthews; she asked me to count some apples out of the hamper. We found this box in the hamper. A person called Mr. Matthews up and told him of it. The ass came home by itself that night. The prisoner had not sold all.
Do you know how long it was before the prisoner came home after the ass came back?
No.
Did you say any thing to the prisoner about this box?
No.
I am servant to the prosecutor. The prisoner came to my master's shop to know if we wanted any apples; I left him in the shop, and went up stairs to enquire if we wanted any.
Had you seen the box that day?
No, but I saw it the day before.
I am servant to the prosecutor. I saw the prisoner in the shop, and asked him the price of his apples, but I did not buy any.
Did you see any thing of the box that day?
No.
Did the prisoner use to go out with apples constantly?
Yes.
Did any body go with him?
No.
I have worked with Matthews three or four years; I sell things for him.
He always behaved very well, I never heard any harm of him. He never wronged me.
