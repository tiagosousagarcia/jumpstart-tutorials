You are a bookseller and publisher in Paternoster-row?
Yes: I had employed a person of the name of Mary Pettit, to few up publications for many years past; she has sewed many thousands of Dr. Wright's Family Bible, which were delivered to her in quires; but I never sold any in quires. In consequence of information I received, I went to Mr. Davis, a cheesemonger, on the 14th of last month, about nine o'clock in the evening, with Mr. Gill; we found, on examination, one hundred and twenty-four pounds weight of paper, which I got back again, and paid him at the rate of three-pence per pound Eighty-two pounds were mine, enough to render three or four hundred pounds worth of books imperfect; there were three numbers of the Bible also, and two numbers of the Lady's Magazine; I have no doubt they all belonged to me; I saw the prisoner the day after, about four o'clock in the afternoon; I made her no promise or threat, but I asked her several questions about the paper, and she told me she stole them by degrees from Mrs. Pettit's house, and tied them up in a parcel, which she took in her apron, and carried to some receptacle, where she kept them till they accumulated to a large quantity, and had done so for years.
The prisoner was not employed by you?
No, by her sister, as a chair-woman.
Other persons serve in your shop?
Yes, Mr. Kelly, my clerk, is here.
Can you say, upon your oath, that they have not sold these articles?
Certainly it is impossible.
There is a perquisite of waste paper in the trade, is not there?
No, I never heard of it; I know thee is no such custom.
Did you not make a promise, or tell her it would be better for her?
No, I never heard it said; I believe none was ever made.
Where do you live?
In Angel-street, Butcherhall-hall, St. Martin's-le-Grand, and was employed by Mr. Hogg to stitch books for him; the prisoner is my husband's sister, and has assisted me in the household work, but I had never missed any of the books he trusted to me.
Do you know any thing of those numbers charged in the indictment, of how they came into possession of the prisoner?
Not at all; I know nothing about it; I gave her leave to take waste paper from my house, but, as to numbers, I cannot conceive how they could come among waste paper; neither numbers or quires are waste paper.
I am a cheesemonger, in Lincoln's-Inn-fields: I bought one hundred and seventy-four pounds weight of paper of the prisoner, for three-pence per pound, and delivered to Mr. Hogg one hundred and twenty-four pounds; I had used the other; that which Mr. Hogg received had remained on the shelf from the time I bought it; I did not notice that it was in quires; it was not in the same state that it is now, because it was tied up in a rough manner, with paper of different sorts, what I call waste.
You cannot venture to swear to it?
No.
Did you enquire who she was?
I understood, when I bought it, that she had sold to the man who kept the shop before me; she said, she had friends in that way; I bought it was waste paper.( James Peddir , the constable, produced the paper, which was identified by Thomas Kelly .)
(To Peddir.) As you were taking the prisoner to the Compter, did she say any thing to you?
Yes; she said, she did not mind it had nobody known of it but herself; I asked her if Mrs. Pettit partook of any of the money; she said, no, and as for her brother, he was as innocent as the child unborn.
I leave my defence to my Counsel.
What are you?
I am a bookbinder.
Are there any perquisites allowed of waste paper?
There is in our trade, as a bookbinder, and I suppose it goes to a greater degree with the stitchers.
Is that waste paper? (Pointing to the paper produced.)
No; I don't think this is; waste paper is that which accumulates about the shop, rumpled and dirty.
I went to look at the paper, and it appeared to me to be a parcel of rubbish.
Take care what you say - look at that paper, upon your oath do you mean to say that is rubbish?
I did not see this paper; I saw four or five bundles, but only the outside, as they would not let me open it.
I am a bookbinder, and it is a rule with some people to give the damaged sheets to the boys.
Is that waste paper, or any thing like it?
I cannot say; it would be of no other use to me.
