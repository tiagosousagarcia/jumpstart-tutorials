On the 21st of May, I met the prisoner on London-bridge; she seemed to know me: she said I was her countryman, and asked me to give her something to drink, which I did. It rained very hard. She said she lived at Mile-end; that she had friends there, worth 40 l. a year every day in the week; and if I would take a coach, and carry her to Mile-end, she would make me amends. I took a coach, and went to Mile-end: we got out of the coach, and went into a public-house; being weary, I was about falling asleep; I felt my watch go out of my pocket; I opened my eyes, and said, What do you mean by that? She said, if I took the watch from her, she would swear my life away. I gave her all the good words I could to get my watch again: she said, if I would go back to Whitechapel with her, she would give me the watch. I did; and, when we came to Whitechapel, she endeavoured to make her escape; I called the watch, and gave charge of her, and then she gave charge of me. She had my watch in her bosom; I pulled at it, the chain broke off, and was left in her bosom.
I am a watchman in Whitechapel. When I was going my rounds, I saw this man and woman together, after eleven o'clock; he gave me charge of her for stealing his watch, and she gave charge of him; she had his great-coat on.
How came she to have your coat on?
As we were coming back, she desired me to lend her my coat.
He pulled me about in the street; I cried out, Watch! and gave charge of him. I lost my cloak.
