I was coming up Holborn; I saw a person drawing a truck, he went into a public house, and left the truck in the street; the prisoner and two others were pushing behind; when they came to Brook-street, the prisoner took this firkin, and put it on his shoulder, and I went up and took him.
I am a cheesemonger , in New Compton-street; the butter and firkin is the property of me and my brother; we are partners.
