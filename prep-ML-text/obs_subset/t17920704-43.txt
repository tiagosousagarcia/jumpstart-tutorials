I lost a knife case and three caddees; I was not at home; I left the things in the shop when I went out, and when I returned they were gone.
I got the things from the prosecutor's house; I am a constable.
I heard the cry of stop thief! and I saw the prisoner run, and he dropped the goods; I saw them taken to Mr. Caldwell's.
