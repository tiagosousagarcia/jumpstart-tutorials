Where do you live?
In Cornhill ; the prisoner was my servant ; In consequence of my house being broke open, on the 6th of January, her box was searched, and several pieces of soap and a great many candles were found in it; the cork-screw was found in her pocket, and several other things between her bed and mattrass.
You don't mean to swear to the soap and candles?
No; the corkscrew had been missing for two or three months, and another had been bought in its place.
I am a constable, and was sent for on the 6th of January; I searched the prisoner's box in the presence of Mr. and Mrs. Bish, and the prisoner; a great quantity of soap and candles were in it, and the cork-screw was in her pocket. (Produces them.)
I know it to be my property; I thought the officers had the snuffer-stand; if they have not, I don't know where it is.
