I am clerk to Richard Grace and Thomas Yellop , they are colour manufacturers in Old-street , the prisoner has been six years in their service as a labourer .
On the 22d of June had the prisoner been there as watchman.
Yes, I had let him in on Saturday evening, and I had locked him in there.
Did you attend early in the morning of Sunday close to the gates with two officers.
Yes, I did not see him come out of the gate exactly, we stopped him, and desired him to come back when he was just out of the gate, he returned readily; when we all came together to Mr. Yellop's dwelling house the carman, whose business it was to let him out, was standing at the door; he was taken into the house, I told him he was suspected of being dishonest, Garret the constable immediately searched him, in each coat pocket he found a parcel of yellow colour, called king's yellow, the two parcels together weighed two pounds and a half, and within his waistcoat and breeches were laid flat and round his body. fourteen pounds weight of verdigrease, it was tied up in a long paper bag.
You are the clerk, was there such a commodity as yellow colour and verdigrease there.
There positively was.
I understand you to say he came back very readily.
He did.
I suppose from the nature of your trade it was impossible to prove any loss.
No, he might have taken twenty pounds, we could not miss any, the quantity is too large.
I am a servant to Messrs Grace and Yellop.
On the morning of the 22d of June did you let the prisoner out of the manufactory.
I did, I heard Mr. Muston call to him while I stood at the door.
You are a constable.
I am, I searched the prisoner, I produce what was found upon him, these are the two parcels of yellow colour that I took from his pocket and this is the verdigrease, it was taken from under the waistband of his breeches and his waistcoat.
