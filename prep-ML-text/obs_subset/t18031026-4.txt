- I am a carpenter , No. 3, Queen-street, Islington; I lost a saw from a building in Watling-street ; it was found at a pawnbroker's in Turnmill-street.
sworn. - I am the son of the last witness: On Saturday evening, the 1st of October, I put the saw under the bench when we left off work, and on Tuesday the 4th I found it at Thomas Wells 's, a pawnbroker, in Turnmill-street.
I am servant to Mr. Wells (produces a saw) ; I took it in pledge from Thomas Hyde ; I am certain he is the man; I took it in on Monday the 3d of October, between nine and ten o'clock in the morning; I lent him three shillings upon it.
I was fuddled, and I don't know what possessed me to take it.
