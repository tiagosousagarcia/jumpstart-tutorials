I am a linen draper in Leicester-fields . I lost eight linen handkerchiefs out of the shop on the 12th of February, at I believe about four o'clock; they were on the counter. There were several people in the shop; the prisoner came in under pretence of looking at some cotton for a bedgown. I turned about for a piece of muslin; when I turned back I missed the handkerchiefs. I jumped over the counter to shew this other person the muslin. The prisoner said the cotton would not do, and went out. I went after her and took the handkerchiefs from under her arm, under her cloak. I brought her back again. She was taken to the office in Litchfield-street.
What is the value of the handkerchiefs?
They were worth eight shillings.
I never took any thing. I had witnesses yesterday.
