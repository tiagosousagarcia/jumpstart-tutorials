You are a goldsmith , in Cockspur-street ?
Yes, the prisoner was my clerk ; about three months ago, I asked him for his cash-book, and when I examined it, I found he was twenty-seven pounds short, as well as some articles he had omitted to enter into his book; I put the book into the drawer, and when I looked for it afterwards, it was gone; I asked him for it, he said, he had not seen it since he gave it to me; I said, I was confident, from his manner, he had it, and proposed going to his lodgings, which he refused; having lost several things, I began to have some suspicion of him, and sent for a constable; we went to his lodgings, and on opening his box, this book was discovered, together with a silver fish-knife, a diamond ring. gold rings, five table spoons, and all those articles named in the indictment, which the officer has; I never entrusted the prisoner with them, nor had he any right to take them.
You did not make him any promise, did you?
No.
You had lost those things at a variety of times, so that it is impossible for you to say, they went all at once?
I cannot say.
I am a patrol belonging to Bow street, and accompanied Mr. Gilbert to the prisoner's lodgings, who went with us. where we found these articles.
I leave my defence to my Counsel.
