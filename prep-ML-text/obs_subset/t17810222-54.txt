I keep a cheesemonger's shop . A bag of grocery was left in the shop by my father to be sent into the country; a waggoner was to call for it in the evening.
I was servant to Mr. James Clarke in Newgate-street; the goods were brought in about five o'clock, to be forwarded by the waggon into the country that evening. I laid them on some bags at the door. I saw the prisoner slip them off and take them away a little before six o'clock in the evening. I ran round the counter and saw him crossing the way; I went and laid hold of him and brought him back. The bill of parcels was taken out of the bag at the mansion house, and the bag and its contents was delivered to the constable.
There were two women came out of the shop with the parcel, and dropped it at the door. I picked it up as I came by.
