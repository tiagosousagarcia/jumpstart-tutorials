I am the wife of Samuel Walford; I lost a washing-tub out of the yard in the night of the 16th of June; I live in Green-arbour-court, Little Moorfields ; I saw it on the Monday afterwards, in Shoreditch watch-house, I know nothing about the prisoner.
I am a watchman; between two and three o'clock last Saturday was a fortnight, the 16th, in the morning, the prisoner passed my box; I asked he what she had got there, she said, washing-tubs; she said, she had brought them from Mookwell-street, and was going to take them to one Mrs. Hart, a dealer, in Spitalfields-market; I told her to go along, and she turned down Horshoe-alley, and I went after her; I told her, that was not her way to Spitalfields-market, and then I suspected her, and took her to the watch-house. (Produces the tub.)
I had this tub made for me, and the cooper put me on a hoop that came only halfway down, I wanted an iron hoop, but he refused to put one on.
Mrs. Hart gave them to me, she was very much intoxicated, and I told her, I would take them home for her the next morning; I know nothing of where they came from, any more than the child unborn.
