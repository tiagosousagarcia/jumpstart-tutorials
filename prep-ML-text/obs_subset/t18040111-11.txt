I am an assistant elder in the East-India Company's warehouses in Seething-lane ; the prisoner was a labourer in the warehouses: On the 13th of December, at the usual time of discharging the labourers, I found in the prisoner's pocket about three pounds weight of indigo; I asked him what he had there; I took him into the accompting-house, and took indigo out of his coat pockets on each side; he said, he hoped I would not hurt him; we took him to Billiter-lane, and there he said he had lost half-a-guinea, and wanted to make up his loss by the sale of that indigo; it is of the same quality with that in the warehouses.
This is the same sort of indigo; it is worth ten shillings a pound.
It is the first time I was ever guilty of such a thing; I throw myself on the mercy of the Court.
