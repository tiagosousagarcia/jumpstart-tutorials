Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I am locker at the tobacco-warehouses on Towerhill : On the 13th of September the prisoner was employed as a cooper in those warehouses; it is kept in the King's warehouse till the duty is paid; when the prisoner was going away, I suspected him, searched him, and found in his hat this quantity of tobacco; (producing it;) he said he had never done the like before, and hoped I would not take any notice of it; I then sent for a constable.
Do you know that any tobacco was missing?
It is impossible to say.
A great number of people keep tobacco there?
Yes.
Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I am gate-keeper at the warehouses upon Towerhill: I saw Jeeper stop the prisoner, and take the tobacco from him; he asked forgiveness, and said he had never done so before.
I am keeper of the warehouse.
Is there not a Mr. Gordon in the warehouse, as well as you?
Yes.
He is responsible as well as you, is he not?
I should suppose so.
Were you ever called upon to make good any losses singly?
No.
Have you any knowledge on the subject at all?
No.
