I live in Bear street , I am a band box maker, the prisoner worked for me; I missed all the articles in the indictment during the time the prisoner worked for me.
Them things were never hers in the world.
I am an officer; I searched the prisoner's lodging on the 10th of June, No. 23, Grafton street, the prisoner was there at the time; on her person I found a flannel petticoat, which Mrs. Davis identified to be her property, and in the apartment I found, I think it is, seven locks and a gridiron; I found a duplicate of a sheet pledged for half a crown at Mr. Lucas's; there is three pasteboard patterns, I produce them.
I live at No. 4, Rider's court, I am apprentice to Mr. Lucas; I produce a sheet pledged by the prisoner at the bar for half a crown.
The sheet I have had these four years, I bought a pair of them in Cranbourn alley; there is one lock I have had twenty-two years, that gridiron I bought at a sale; there is nothing that belongs to them but the two old pasteboard patterns.
I made the sheet myself.
