I am a baker . On the 16th of December, about twenty minutes after seven in the morning, the prisoner Coombie came down and went to the bakehouse, he then returned with a lighted candle into the shop, took up this instrument and opened the till; he took out copper to the aamount of one shilling and a halfpenny.
Did you see him do all this.
Yes, I was in the cupboard, which commanded the whole of the shop. I looked through a broken window; he made the till fast, he returned the instrument from whence he took it, and went into the bakehouse; I opened the shop and went into the bakehouse to him, and demanded the money, out of his right hand waistcoat pocket, which he had taken out of my till; he then took the money out of his waistcoat pocket, and gave it me. I took him to the watchhouse. I will not swear to the money, only the manner he took it in.
I went home on Sunday afternoon to my father, I told him that I wanted my small clothes mended, I told him I did not like to ask my master, because he was mean enough to deny me. My father gave me half a crown. On Tuesday I got up to work and went down stairs, and cut off a piece of cake of gingerbread, I was hungry; with that my master thought I was robbing the till.
I am his father. I gave the boy on Saturday night half a crown to pay for his washing.
