I am clerk to Mr. Symonds, Pater-noster Row. On the 26th of May the prisoner at the bar brought a note-addressed to H. D. Symonds, I wrote a note to Mr. Dutton to-let him know the price of-it, and that he must send the money because I thought it was a a fraud; Mr. Symonds came down at the time, I told him I had wrote a note that he could not have them without the money; he made a pause and said, perhaps Mr. Dutton wanted them, I said I believed it was not Mr. Dutton's hand writing, and the man said he came from Mr. Dutton, he was in a hurry; I asked him his name, he said John Moore , I delivered them to him.
It is very odd how you came to send them when you suspected the man.
Because Mr. Symonds came down stairs.
What was it.
Curtit's Botanical Lectures, 3 vols.
The man sent a note up stairs, I sent word down I would leave it to him to do as he pleased; he not knowing the man wrote a note, I happened to go down stairs, and ordered him to let the books go, as Mr. Dutton might want the books in a hurry.
You thought he was sent by Mr. Dutton.
Yes.
Look at that paper.
I am a bookseller in Gracechurch-street; that is not my hand writing.
I am shopman to a pawnbroker. On the 26th of May the prisoner brought these three volumes for me to purchase, I gave him a guinea and a half for them; I am sure he is the same man.
When I first came to this bar I pleaded guilty, for this reason, I would not wish to trouble your your lordship, nor offend my prosecutor with a tedious defence.
