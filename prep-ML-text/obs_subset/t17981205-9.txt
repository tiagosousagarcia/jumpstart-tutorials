Between the 5th and 11th of November, I lost ten shillingsworth of halfpence at two different times, out of my bedroom, the prisoner was my servant ; I found them upon the table in her room, covered over with her clothes, she had been cleaning herself; there were two five-shilling papers, one was tied up, and the other was untied; I charged the prisoner with it, and she did not deny it.
Did you say you would forgive her, or any thing of that sort?
No.
A. I am a constable: I was sent for to take the prisoner into custody; she owned to taking of two papers.
I can speak to the papers that the halfpence are in, but not to the halfpence, they are mine.
I do not know any thing about the halfpence, I did not put them there.
I believe it is the first offence she has ever been guilty of, I had a very good character with her.
