I have a house in George-street, Westminster , but I do not live in it, it was not tenanted at the time: On the 13th of November, I was going by it, and thought the joint of the door was more open than it should be; before I could get to it, the door opened, and a man and boy came out; the man is the prisoner; I asked him what he was doing there; he said, he had been to see his friends; I took him by the collar; a scuffle ensued, and some hard blows passed; my hand slipped from his collar, and he run away, and I after him, calling stop thief; a soldier stopped him, and he was taken to prison; I found nothing on him; I went back to the house, and found the passage full of articles tied up in an apron, and a dark lantern; I knew the things had been removed; the bed-furniture was removed.
I was going down King-street, Westminster, and heard the cry of stop thief; I saw a man running, and stopped the prisoner.
I am a constable, and took the prisoner into custody.
I leave my defence to my Counsel; I have nothing to say.
