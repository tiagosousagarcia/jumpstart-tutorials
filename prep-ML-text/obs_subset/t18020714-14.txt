I am a tailor and salesman , the prisoner has made waistcoats for me these five years; having lost a great number of articles, and having a suspicion of the prisoner, I went, on Friday last, with an officer to her lodgings, in Red-lion-market, where I found several duplicates; among them was a duplicate of this child's dress; I found it at a pawnbroker's in Little-Britain.
This is a dress which I lost out of my shop, I know it by the mark; I had seen it at the latter end of May, or beginning of June; it must have been taken from the counter; the prisoner was frequently left there for half an hour together, and sometimes an hour.
