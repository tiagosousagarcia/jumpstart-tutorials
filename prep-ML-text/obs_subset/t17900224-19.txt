I keep a public house : on Thursday, the 28th of January, between ten and eleven at night, the prisoner came and ordered a pot of beer; and I saw him go to the place where the pots are commonly kept, and he stole a quart and a pint pot, and carried them out of doors; I had before, this same evening, lost a copper can; and expecting the prisoner to come back, I had got two men waiting in Wingfield-street.
On the 28th of January, I was watching the prisoner by Mr. Cox's desire; and hearing an alarm, I catched him quietly in my arms, just as he had come out of the house, with the property; and on, the ground, by the side of him, lay the quart and pint pot; I brought him into Mr. Cox's house; and the watchman carried him to the watch-house and the pots.
I am a Headborough; I know no more than Mr. Cox brought in the prisoner and the pots to the watch-house; and I have had them ever since.
I took up the pots, I stopped him, together with Moses Fonseca .
I was asked by Cox's boy to get him down a pot; and in doing that a pint pot fell down upon my head; immediately they rang a bell, and carried me to the watch-house.
