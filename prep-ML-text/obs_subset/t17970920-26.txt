- I am the wife of George Cripps , a publican ; the prisoner came into our house with another person to drink; he did not sit down, but was walking backwards and forwards about the house; I went into the parlour while he was there, and the cloth laid in the window; about ten minutes after that, I went in again, and the cloth was gone, no person had been out of the house but him; I went in pursuit of him, and my husband was coming up the road, I told him of it, and he went after him.
- I am a publican; I saw my wife in pursuit of the prisoner; I went after him across the field, and sent a man upon my mare the road way; I pursued him to Hillingdon, the man on horseback was there before me, and had taken him; we were bringing him back, when we met one of his officers, he said he had not done it; I told him I would go down to the major with him, and then he said, I suppose you want your things again, I will go and show you where I did them, but I hope you will not be too rash upon me, for I am afraid it will hand me; he went with us, and missed the place where they were did, I was walking along and found them myself in a ditch, in a wheat stubble field.
I went upon Mr. Cripps's mare in pursuit of the prisoner to his quarters; I took him off the bed; we met his officer, and he desired a constable to be sent for; I saw George Cripps find the things in the ditch.
I am a soldier in the Middlesex Supplementary Militia; I called at the prosecutor's house with my comrade, and had rather more liquor than I wanted, and as I was going across the field to my quarters, I saw a man go over a gate into a ditch, in a stubble field, and throw something down; I went home to my quarters, and this man came and took me, and told me Cripps would not hurt me if I told him where the things were, and I told him what I had seen, and he found it there, I never took the property.
