- I am a carpenter ; I was at work at Woolwich ; the prisoner worked for the same master that I did: On Sunday night, the 21st of September, I believe, my tools were stolen; I saw them on Saturday night, the 20th, and on Monday, the 22d, they were gone; the prisoner did not come to work for my master after that night; I found the tools at different pawnbrokers' shops; the pawnbrokers are here; they were pledged in my name.
- I am a pawnbroker, (produces a plow-plane, a stock and a saw): there are thirty-two bits to the stock, and eight irons belonging to the plow; I cannot swear to the prisoner; they were pledged for fourteen shillings.
- I am a pawnbroker, (produces five planes and a square) they were pledged for two shillings and sixpence; I have no knowledge of the person that pledged them.
I am an officer belonging to Marlborough-street: I took charge of the prisoner; I searched his box, where he directed me, at the Baptisthead public-house, in Holborn; he was charged at the office with another offence; he told me it was his box, and gave me the key of it, but it had no key, nor any lock; in his waistcoat pocket I found two duplicates; he told me he had bought the duplicates of another person; they correspond with the duplicates now produced.
I keep the Baptisthead public-house in Holborn; Kennedy came to my house, and I saw two duplicates found; I cannot swear that these are the same; the prisoner lodged with me.
Was I not at my lodgings the night the things were lost?
I cannot swear to it, but I believe he was; he came about that time; I have known him for a great while, and always truste m as one of my own family. (The property was deposed to by the prosecutor.)
I bought these duplicates of a person in the trade.
