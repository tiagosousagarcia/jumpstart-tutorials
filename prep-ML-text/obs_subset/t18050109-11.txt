- I live at No. 16, Manchester-square : On the 12th of December, I opened my trunk, I missed a shift, an apron, and a shawl, I found the trunk unlocked; I had seen the articles a few days before in the trunk, and when I saw them last I locked the trunk; the duplicates were found on her in a pocket-book; there was no other person in the house but the prisoner, my mistress, and myself; I kept my trunk outside of the door of my room.
I produce an apron, a shift, and an handkerchief; I wrote the ticket, but I cannot say that I took them in; I do not know to whom I gave that ticket. (The property produced, and identified by the prosecutrix.)
