I am a needle-maker ; the prisoner had been in my service as a labourer in the finishing of needles ; the needles lost were fixed in a nest of drawers, ready for sale, put each side separate; I saw him arise to take them; this good man I had placed great confidence in, and had left him to eat his dinner, in the room; he had come to finish his work left undone that day; I went to eat my dinner, I saw him arise from his dinner, which I suppose was to take the property; after he had left the place I examined these drawers, he went backward to the shed where he used to work; and, finding the goods missing, I immediately applied to an officer, who came and searched him, and found the property upon him; the officer took the property, his name is Furnell.
I examined the prisoner, and found these needles upon him.
