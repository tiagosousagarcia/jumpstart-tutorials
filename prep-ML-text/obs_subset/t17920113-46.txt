I live with Mr. Wyndham; the prisoner also lived as his valet-de-chambre
, in Grosvenor-place ; I understood the prisoner had lodgings near Pimlico; he was a married man; on the 10th of December he was in Mr. Wyndham's service; there were several things missing before; on that day Townsend went and searched, and found the things.
The prisoner lived with me about six months, and the first notice I had of any thing missing was of this Francis Margrett ; on which I determined to take some measures to see who robbed me; Margrett first of all brought me up some dirty linen, which was not worn by me: after\\ send\\ ing the first witness up to town, I called the prisoner at the bar, and told him the steps I was going to take, and made him deliver up all his keys to Junius Baker ; he delivered them up very willingly; Junius Baker sent me a letter; I came up to town, and went to Bow-street, and these goods produced were found at the prisoner's lodgings; he said, I did not mean to hang him; I told him I was determined to prosecute whoever I found out: I had a very good character from Lord Robert Spencer .
