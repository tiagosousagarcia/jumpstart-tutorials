I keep an hotel , in Covent-garden . The prisoner came to sleep one night, at one o'clock.
The prisoner came down in the morning, and asked, What was to pay? I said, I would let him know, if he would walk into the parlour. I went up stairs, and found the bed stripped. I halloo'd out, to let them know the things were gone. The prisoner came up, and threw the things down upon the bed. I met him at the door: just as I was coming out of the room, he went in. I came down stairs immediately, and told my master and the people in the house of it. When I came up again, the things were found upon the bed, folded up.
Were they upon the bed when you went in first?
No.
Did nobody go up but him?
No: I left him in the room, and came down. He wanted to push by me, to get into the room: I screamed out, and said the bed was stripped.
I am guilty of the fact.
