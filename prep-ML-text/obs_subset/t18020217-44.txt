I am a smith , and live at No. 10, Coleman-street ; The prisoner was my journeyman ; I missed a quantity of iron, and in consequence of suspicion, on Saturday the 6th of February, when I had paid him his wages, I followed him out of the shop, and having an officer ready, I charged him with having my property upon him; he was immediately brought into the shop, and four pieces of iron were found upon him, they weighed twenty-three pounds; they were concealed inside of his waistcoat.
I am foreman to Mr. Russell: The prisoner went down into the cellar to look out some iron for some work that he was about, I afterwards went down, and saw that some iron had been removed to the edge of the privy-door, and I informed my master of it; I saw it there again at three o'clock, the prisoner went down again between four and five; after he was gone, I went down and missed it; I then informed my master of it, and he was stopped. ( John Fenner , the constable, produced the iron, which he found upon the prisoner, and which was identified by the prosecutor, and his foreman.)
My wife and I had had a fit of sickness, and we were in very great distress.
