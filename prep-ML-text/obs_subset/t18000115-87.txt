The prisoner was taken up by a warrant: from the Lord-Mayor: I went with Mr. Wigzell with a search-warrant to the prisoner's cellar under a hair-dresser's shop in the Minories; at the first entrance into the cellar the first thing Mr. Wigzell saw was a trett stuck in the cask; (producing it;) it was produced before the Lord Mayor in the presence of the prisoner.
Was not Mr. Newman, the clerk, taking it down in writing at the time?
Mr. Newman was writing, but I cannot say what he was writing.
If he was writing, it must be supposed he was taking the examination.
So this was stuck fast in the cask in the cellar?
Yes.
Not secreted, or put away any-where?
No.
So that any body might see it that went into the cellar?
Yes.
Then if any body might see it the prisoner might see it?
Certainly.
The prisoner at the bar was my servant .
Do you know this trett?
Yes, it bears my initials; and besides that there are marks underneath; about six years ago I had occasion to put a new worm into it; it was necessary to put the head of it into a vice, and there are the vice-marks upon it; I have not the least doubt in the world that it is mine; I have had it ever since I have been in business, and been in the habit of seeing it; I accompanied Church to the prisoner's cellar on the Monday, I think the 3d or 4th of January; I stated to the prisoner that I missed several tools, and among the rest, this trett; he said he had never seen any thing of it, and did not know any thing of it.
I have no doubt but the thing in your hand, be it what it will, is your property?
It is.
I take it other persons in your employment used it?
They might.
