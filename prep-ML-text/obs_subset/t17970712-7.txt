On Monday, the 3d of July, I saw the prisoner take a pocket-book out of Mr. Beach's pocket, about half past twelve o'clock at noon, upon Ludgate-hill ; the constable has the pocket-book here; I took hold of him, and delivered him to the constable.
Do you know the prosecutor's name?
Yes; John Beach.
I am a constable: (produces the pocket-book) ; it was delivered to me by the last witness.
I was walking along when this man charged me with stealing the pocket-book; I did not do any such thing.
