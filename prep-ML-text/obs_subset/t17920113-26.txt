I am wife to Daniel Clissall , a grocer ; I was not in the shop at the time the property was taken; I only prove the property.
I am a patrol: on the 19th of December, coming up Drury-lane , I saw two men near this shop; I thought they looked like suspicious people; in five minutes one of the men opened the door, and went into the shop, and took the canister out of the house; I stopped them in the street, and asked them what they had, and they said, nothing; with that the prisoner threw the canister from under his arm into the street; he turned round short, and began to run, and I stopped him; I picked up the canister and brought it back into the shop, and left it with Mrs. Clissall. (Produced and deposed to.) It is four-shilling green tea; there is 2 lb. and a half.
I was coming by, and a man came out of the shop and threw down the tea, and they took me in a mistake; I am innocent.
My Lord, the prisoner will be very happy in going for a soldier.
If I was sure of his going; but I understand applications have been made of that sort, the Court have indulged them, and they have not gone.
My Lord, I will be bound in 500 l. that I will see him safely secured to the officer before he leaves his confinement; and more than that, I have spoken to an officer; this day or tomorrow morning he shall be taken.
