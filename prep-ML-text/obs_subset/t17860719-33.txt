I employ this woman by the week; I went out on the 3d of June, and on my return, I found the place stripped of every thing; I am a cricket and trap ball maker ; I left the prisoner at home and nobody else; I found her on the 13th; I found some of my things at a pawnbroker's, she said, some she had lost, and some she pawned, she said, she pawned some in Shoreditch, and some in Whitechapel, but I found none at either of the places.
My things were sent to Chaffings to be washed.
On the 3d of June the prisoner pawned these two coats at our house.
I did not send her to pawn them.
I worked for the prosecutor at half a crown a week, and he could not pay me; his wife gave me the things to pawn, and lent me the gown to go and see my sister at Deptford.
Did Richards's wife lend her the gown.
No, she did not.
