I am the wife of William Hall, he is a shoemaker , I live in Tottenham court road . On the 23d of December Mary Plant came into my house, I have known her for these nine years; when she came in the watch was hanging at the fire place, on the side of the mantle piece. She took the child out of my arms and kissed it; she then set the child on the ground and went away.
Did you observe her go to the mantle piece where this watch hung.
She was within half a yard of the mantle piece the whole time.
Who was in the house besides.
No one, except herself, and me, and the child; I was sitting at the fire place, I did not see her take it. On the 26th of December I saw the watch at Marlborough street. I met the prisoner in Holborn, my husband was with me, we laid hold of her, she said do not say any thing to me in the street, if you will come to me in Lincoln's Inn fields I will tell you where the watch is; she told me that she took it from the mantle piece. We found it at Mr. Page's in Liquor Pond street.
I went with the prisoner to the pawnbroker's, she had lodged with me five weeks; I pawned the watch in my own name, because I knew Mr. Page. She said it was her father's watch, and she had borrowed it of her mother; she owed me money.
How much did you get on the watch.
A guinea and a half.
I am a pawnbroker. Elizabeth Stone pledged the watch with me on the 23d of December; she said it was her own.
I beg for mercy.
