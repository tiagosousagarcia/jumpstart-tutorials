I am a working silversmith , I live at No. 13, New Lisle street, Leicester square , the prisoner worked for me; I had very great reason to suppose that I missed my silver filings, and business occasioned me to be very much out of the shop; I ordered my boys to look after my men; I was taken dangerously ill, when one of my boys informed me one of my men was robbing me; we ordered the watchman to come in; the prisoner was coming down stairs to go home from his work; I told him he had got my silver; he was searched, and the silver was found on him; he was then taken to the watchhouse; he confessed he was guilty, and hoped I would forgive him.
Boy, you live with that gentleman
Yes. I saw the prisoner put his hand in the skin and take out a handful of silver filings, and put it in his left hand breeches pocket. I informed my master.
On the 4th at nine o'clock they gave me charge of the prisoner; I searched him and took these filings from his left hand breeches pocket.
to prosecutor. Look at those silver filings
I had such in my work shop.
How many partners have you - A. None.
On the 4th of November I was going to work about seven o'clock in the morning; at the corner of Drury lane I saw a small parcel wrapped up in brown paper and tied with a bit of twine; it being a wet morning the paper broke; I emptied it out in my hand and put it in my small clothes pocket; my master called me out and searched me; I deny that I owned to it; I was asked whether that was the filings that were taken out of my pocket; I said yes; I told the magistrate that it was my own, I found it.
