Upon Friday the 18th of last month I was stopped about a quarter after six, by the highwaymen, within about twenty yards from Acton-lane , I was stopped in the great road going to Acton, a man whose person and voice resemble the prisoner's rode up to the boy, and ordered him to stop; they met me first, and turned again; I was in a post-chaise; upon his turning back my postilion stopped, then the other man came up and robbed me; the man I take to be the prisoner, came up after the other man had robbed me, and dashed his pistol through the glass, and swore he would blow my brains out if I did not give all I had. It was neither light nor dark, he had something over his face; I cannot speak certainly to him, I lost my watch and two guineas, and some silver.
I am servant to Mr. Watson, I was driving the chaise at the time of the robbery; about one hundred yards against Acton-lane Inn two highwaymen came up to the carriage, they parted, and one went on one side, the other the other; they turned back, and one came to me, and ordered me to stop, this came and dashed the pistol through the glass and demanded him rings and pocket-book; and said he would have all; it was the same voice and sized person; his face was covered; I can not say with absolute certainty he is the man.
You cannot positively swear he is the man?
No; only by his voice and size I believe it.
I know nothing but taking him; I found a brace of pistols upon him; here in a pistol that had, ten balls in it, and was a black handkerchief.
I leave it to your lordship; I can prove where I was making merry at that time until four o'clock in the morning, you judge if I had time to do it.
