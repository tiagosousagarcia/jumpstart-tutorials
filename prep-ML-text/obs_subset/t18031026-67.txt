I am porter to Mr. Fernyhough, in Holborn, and had the care of the box which was taken out of the cart; I saw the prisoner take it out, and run off with it; I followed him, and took him by the collar, and brought him back; he got away, but I caught him again, and dragged him into the yard, having never lost sight of him; he pulled out a knife, struck at my throat, and cut my handkerchief; he was then taken into custody by a constable.
I am a constable, and produce the box.
I was in liquor, and a man asked me to carry it to the White Horse, Fetter-lane; I know nothing of the robbery.
I saw him take it out of the cart.
