I am a haberdasher , 18, Coventry-street, St. James's . On the 22nd of December, in the evening, I saw the prisoner in my shop, she was looking at some purple ribbon; and suspecting, from her appearance, that she was a shop-lifter, I asked her, what she wanted; she replied, some ribbon to match the pattern he shewed me; I answered, that it was impossible to match that colour by candle light. She selected a piece, and had a yard and a half cut off, which she paid for, and went out of the shop. I instantly went out of doors, and got sight of her. At Rupert-street I pushed her into Mr. Pitts shop an hosier's, I said, to her in Mr. Pitts shop, you have robbed me, and sent for a constable; and before the constable came, half a piece of ribbon dropped from underneath her, I said, to her, what is that, she said, I do not know sir; it does not belong to me, I took it up, it had my private mark on it; she said, she had kicked it along the street, I observed it was impossible, it was a very dirty night, and the ribbon was clean.
I live at No. 6, Coventry-street, the corner of Rupert-street, and Coventry-street. Mr. Simonds and the prisoner came into my shop, he informed me she had robbed him, I sent our boy for a constable; and while he was gone for a constable the woman dropped a piece of ribbon.
I am a constable, I was sent for, I took charge of the prisoner; the ribbon has been in my possession ever since.
I went into Mr. Simonds shop, I bought a yard and a half of ribbon; I came out of the shop and was going towards my home, I saw a woman drop this piece of ribbon, I picked it up, this gentleman asked me what I picked up, I said, a piece of ribbon; he said, it was his, he pushed me into a shop; I refused letting him have the ribbon because I saw it drop, he saw a woman run away.
Did you see any other woman running away - .
No; she denied having the ribbon at first.
