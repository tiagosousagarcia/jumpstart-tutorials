On the 2d of October I came to town with the Newbury waggon, with a load to Mr. Pengree's, on Snow-hill. The prisoner, who was shopman at Mr. Pengree's, asked me if I would have any more halfpence? I bought five guineas-worth of them, and carried them to Newbury. The parcel contained 7 l. 10 s. worth of halfpence: while I was putting them off at Newbury, there was a noise in the town, and I was sent for to the mayor. I told him where I got them, upon which an officer was sent with me from Newbury to London, to find out the man. I was taken to the Solicitor of the Mint; he directed me to go and buy five guineas-worth more, and that Mr. Clarke, and some officers, should be in waiting to take the man. Accordingly I went to Mr. Pengree's: I saw Jones, and desired that he and Holder would bring five guineas-worth of halfpence to the Three Tuns, in Fleet-market: at six o'clock Holder came, with a parcel of halfpence under his arm, and was secured by the Bow-street officers. Jones came when Holder was in custody, and was likewise secured.
I am a constable, at Newbury. Walter was taken up at Newbury, and carried before the mayor, for putting off bad halfpence. He said he bought them of Holder and another man, who were both porters to Mr. Pengree, on Snow-hill. I found 3 l. 15 s. in halfpence, by his direction, hid under some straw, by a hay-rick. I was sent to town with him.
I went with Walter to the Three Tuns, Fleet-market. Holder came with these bad halfpence, done up in a mat, under his arm ( producing them) There were to the\\ amountof 7 l. 10 s. in bad halfpence.
I had a parcel of a person in Smithfield: he was to give me 1 s. to carry it to Fleet-market.
