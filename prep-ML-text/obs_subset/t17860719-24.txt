I am a widow woman; I take in lodgers; I lost a table on the 7th of June; I saw it on the 8th of June in the morning about nine, there was a fire behind the house; I was obliged to leave the house with every thing in it; I saw it at the watch-house; I am sure it is the same table; I know it by a mark in the place where it turns over; I have had it four years.
I am watch-house keeper of St. Ann's watch-house, there was a table brought in, on the 7th of June, there was fire the back part of Falconbridge-court.
I am a watchman; I brought the prisoner, and another brought the table; the prisoner had the table on his shoulders; there was two men with him; it has been in my possession ever since.
A man employed me to carry it at past eleven at night; I never saw the man before; the watchman called, says he, where are you going with that table, the man that employed me said to Westminster; the watchman came up and stopped me, says I, stop the owner of the table, he is just a head of you, no, says he, I want you
Did the prisoner at the bar tell you that the man who ran off was the owner of the table?
He did not.
Are you sure of that?
Yes.
He told the Justice that I said so; I gave him charge of the man three or four times.
