On the 5th of January, at about six in the evening, I saw the prisoner take a box of sugar-candy out of Mr. Ringles's cart, at the corner of the Bull Inn in Bishopsgate-street ; I asked him what he did there.
How near was you to the cart when you saw him do that?
Close to him; he made me no answer.
Did he carry it off?
He had not got it quite out; he let go the string, when I spoke to him, and rather pushed the box in; I took him by the collar after he pushed the box in.
It was not taken out of the cart at all was it?
No, it was not.
