I am a seaman : Last Thursday afternoon, about half-past three o'clock, coming from Blackwall, about fifty yards from the Halfway-house (I had just come home from sea) I was tired, I sat down in a ditch, by the road-side, and the sun drew me to sleep; a gentleman who is here, sung out at a window, sailor,sailor, you are robbed; I immediately got up, and missed my hat, a guinea out of my right-hand pocket, and two mackerel; I went after the prisoner and took him with my hat upon his head, and the two mackerel in his hand; I asked him how he came by that hat, he made answer, a seaman gave it to me about half an hour ago; my friend took the hat from him, and he was secured.
I am a rope maker; I was looking out of the window where I live, at the Halfway-house, and saw a sailor lying asleep, and the prisoner took his hat off his head, and two fish; I could not see what fish they were till after I came down; I pursued the prisoner; he had the hat on his head; I took it off the prisoner's head; I took a bit out of the lining, that I might know it again, and gave it to the sailor; he had the fish in his hand.
The sailor said he had got five guineas and a half, and he had but four guineas and a half; and the Magistrate said he had a great mind to keep him for making a false report.
Was you before the Magistrate?
Yes.
Did he charge the prisoner with robbing him of any money?
Yes; a guinea.
What did the prisoner say to that?
He never spoke a word; the sailor sent four guineas home, by a man, to his wife.
Were the Magistrate angry with him at all about that?
No.
I sent four guineas home to my wife, and I ought to have had five.
