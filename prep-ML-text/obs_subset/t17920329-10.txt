I live at the corner of Darkhouse-lane; I lost the things in the indictment on the 24th of March, from out of the kitchen; ours is a publick-house; I took the prisoner with them, coming down stairs, with the coffee-pot in his breeches (the kitchen was up stairs), and the candlesticks in his pockets. (Deposed to.)
I am the constable; I have had these things ever since.
