On the 6th of April I was at the house of Mr. Walter, in Brook's-court, Brook's-Market ; his wife was taken ill between four and five o'clock; I was in the kitchen; I was called into the next room; the street door was open; I put my work on the dresser of the kitchen; I saw the prisoner come in, and reach his hand into the kitchen; I came out, and laid hold of him by the coat, and asked him what he wanted? I saw in his hand, which was partly under his arm, a sleeve of the shirt I had been working on: upon my laying hold of him, he threw the sleeve down, and catched up the shirt, and endeavoured to put it under his arm; I pushed him against the wall, and called out three times for Mr. Walter; the prisoner struck me, and got one of his hands loose; he then shoved me into the kitchen, shut the door, and locked me in; Mr. Walter came down, and ran after him.
I was at work up stairs; I heard a great noise, a screaming, and crying out Murder and Thieves! and I heard my name called; I ran down, and saw the prisoner run out at the door; I followed, and took him; I am sure he is the same man that ran out of the door.
I went into the house to enquire for a coachman; being in liquor, I might throw the shirt down; I went to pick it up; I do not know any thing of it.
