I am osler to Samuel Winbush , in Swallow-street , who is a stable-keeper and hackney-man : Last Wednesday, the prisoner was in the yard, and went out on the box with a coachman, with something in his pocket, which he did not take into the yard; the coachman knew it, and stopped to have a pint of beer at the corner; as soon as they were down from off the box, the coachman laid hold of his collar; and asked me to search him, which I did, and found this bridle.
I went to ask for work as I was much distressed, and found the bridle laying in the yard, on the ground.
