I am a coppersmith in the employ of Mr. Oats in Houndsditch; I was working at Mr. Hickers', Old Ford. On the 20th of December I was melting solder, it was on the fire; the prisoner was a plumber working there at the time; I saw the prisoner dip the metal out while it was on the fire, he put it into water to cool it, it was left there; I informed Mr. Hickers's clerk.
I live at Old Ford , I am employing workmen there, and the prisoner among the rest, he was foreman to the plumbers. On the 20th of December, about four o'clock, from information, I stopped him, in his waistcoat pocket I found these two parcels of solder; it weighed five pounds and a quarter, it is worth a shilling a pound; I found this quantity of lead in his jacket pocket; there is fourteen pound weight of lead; after I had taken the property from the prisoner he attempted to run away, I ran after him and took him.
