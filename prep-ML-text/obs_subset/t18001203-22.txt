I am an engraver , in the Strand; On Thursday morning, the 20th of November, about eight o'clock, I had come from Finchley; as I was coming across a field, from Kentish-town to the Veterinary-college, there is a bridge; the prisoner came up to me there, presented a pistol at me, and demanded my money, or he would blow my brains out immediately; I looked at him very hard; I took my purse out of my pocket, and gave it to him, which contained a half-guinea, a half-crown, and two shillings; he walked away, and said he was very much distressed; I wished him a good morning; I walked about a minute, and recollecting myself, I thought it was too bad to be robbed in the open day; I turned round, and saw the prisoner walking along very contented; I had a stick in my hand, which I held up, and called to him, and he turned back and looked; I told him, I would be d-d if I would not catch him; upon that, he ran across the fields as hard as he could, and I after him; when he found that I was getting near to him, he turned upon me, and I ran away then to keep out of the length of pistol shot, and he pursued me, and kept crying, stop thief, all the time; when he found that I gained ground, he turned back to run away again, and I pursued him again, and when he found I was getting near to him again, he turned upon me again, and stood still; then I saw a young man come running across the fields, who is here; I immediately went up and seized the prisoner by the collar, the young man laid hold of him on the other side; I asked him what he had done with my purse, he said, he had thrown it into a ditch, we began searching him then, and two more men came up, one of whom helped us to search him, and found my purse in one of his coat pockets; he asked me, if that was my purse, I told him it was; I then asked the prisoner where the pistol was, he said he would give it to me, for it could not do me any hurt; he put his hand into his pocket, and gave me the pistol out himself, there was nothing in it, and if there had, I do not think it could have done any hurt, the pistol is here; he said, he was distressed, and he knew he should be hanged for it; I told him, I hoped he would not be hanged, and the young man and myself took him to Bow-street; and left him in charge of the two officers, who are here.
Did I behave with any violence to you?
No, he behaved quite to the contrary.
I was ditching at the top of the field, and I heard the gentleman call stop thief; I ran to assist him; when I came up, I saw the prisoner at the bar; the gentleman had got hold of his collar; he begged for mercy, and said he was sure to be hung, but he was in distress; in the mean time, two gentlemen came up, and searched him; one of them pulled a purse out of his coat-pocket; he took the pistol out of his pocket himself.
I took charge of the prisoner and this pistol; in searching him, I found this knife in his waistcoat pocket; I asked him what he did with it, and he said, he kept it to cut his corns with.
- The purse was delivered to me by the prosecutor. (Produces it).
I delivered the purse to Edwards; this is the same purse that the prisoner took from me; it contains just the money that I was robbed of.
I was going to Kentish-town, and I met that gentleman upon the bridge; I told him I was very much distrest, and asked him to give me a trisle; he said he had no halfpence, and then I stopped him; he cried out stop thief, and that young man came up; I went very quietly with him, and never offered to meddle with his watch; I had just burried my wife, and got two children; I was very much distrest; the spring of the pistol is broke; I had it to mount; I little thought of doing such a thing as I have done.
