The latter end of June last, I had information: in consequence of it I went upon the wharf, and found the prisoner was in the warehouse, and I saw the prisoner come out of the warehouse; he was a confidential servant , entrusted with all the keys to a great amount. I followed him to a chandler's-shop in Thames-street. I went into the shop, and said,
\"William, where do you come from?\" he said,
\"Sir, I have this moment come from the warehouse; I came from the warehouse directly here.\" I asked his business, he said he came to buy his dinner, and produced a shilling. I asked him if he had not some other business; if he had not some property about him that did not belong to him; he said no, he was ready to be searched; I did search him, and under the waistband of his breeches was a handkerchief with sugar; I told him to take it out; he did so; I asked him where he got it; he begged to be forgiven; he had never done any thing of this kind before.
I am a porter; I went into the shop; Mr. Gascoigne gave charge of him.
