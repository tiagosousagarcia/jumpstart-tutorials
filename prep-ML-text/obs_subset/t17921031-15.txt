On the 17th of October I lost two hams; about a quarter before eight in the evening, the prisoner and another came and asked me for a quarter of a pound of cheese; the man threw down a shilling hard on the counter, and it fell down behind the counter; in picking up the shilling, I saw Newman was reaching something out at the door, and I could not think what it was; they were the only two hams in the shop; then Newman laid hold of another ham; as soon as I saw that, I ran round the counter, and cried stop thief! Newman ran out of the shop; they got one ham clear off, the other they dropped; I never recovered the ham again; the hams were both together in the shop, in one place; when the prisoner ran away, he ran about thirty yards; I lost sight of him; when he was brought back, I knew him to be the same man; he offered me two guineas to let him go.
It was between seven and eight in the evening when you lost your hams?
Yes.
You lost only one?
No more.
I am an apprentice to Mr. Wade, cabinet-maker; I heard the prosecutor cry stop thief! he was running, and I stopped him.
I am a baker; I was going by between seven and eight, and I saw Newman have a ham; I don't know who the man was he gave the ham to; then he went into the shop and fetched another, and run out of the shop; we stopped him.
It was dusk, was it not?
Yes, Sir.
Did you ever say, before the alderman, that you did not see him give the ham to any one?
No, sir.
I am a constable, and produce a ham; I had it from the prosecutor.
I know no more than the last witness.
I leave it all to my counsel.
