I am the wife of Stephen Neve, I keep a hosier's shop: Last Wednesday, the prisoner, and another boy came in to ask for gloves and stocking; I told them, I had not any that would suit them, but I shewed them some; they would not do; the prisoner said, he would call again in a day or two; as they went out, I missed a pair of stocking; I went to the door, and called out to stop this boy, and this young man brought the prisoner back, and the stockings.
I saw the prisoner and another boy come out of Mrs. Neve's shop, and I stopped them; I ran after them, and just before I came up to the prisoner, I picked up a pair of stockings in the dirt; I don't know who dropped them, the other boy took another way; I found the stockings the way that the prisoner took, and I delivered them to Mrs. Neve.(The stockings produced, and deposed to by Mrs. Neve.)
I know nothing at al about the stockings. NOT GUILTY .
