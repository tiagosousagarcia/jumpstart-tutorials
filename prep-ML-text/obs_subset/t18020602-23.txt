I live with my father, who is a broker , in Crispin-street, Spitalfields : On the 7th of May, between six and seven o'clock in the evening, I saw the prisoner take a beech chair, and put the back of it under her cloak, she carried it into West-street, about twenty yards from my father's, I followed her, and took it from her, several men came up, and pulled the woman away from me; I took the chair home, and I followed her into Union-street; then I met my father, I told him the woman had taken the chair, and he sent my brother for a constable.
, senior, sworn. - I am a broker, in Crispin-street; I met my sons, the chair was then at my house
I was going for a pennyworth of potatos to Spitalfields-market, and I had nearly fell over the chair at the corner of the street; I took it up and put it on one side.
