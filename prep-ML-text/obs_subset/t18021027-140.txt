I am a widow, No.3, Booth-street, Spitalfields; I am a silk-windster , I hired the prisoner to work with me; on the evening of the 29th of September I gave her nine knots and twelve bobbins of pink silk to wind, I missed some little quantity out of two of the knots that evening; the next morning my master sent me a parcel of black silk, and ordered me to leave off work; immediately I set the prisoner to work on the blacksilk; I went out the next morning, and she told me she wanted to go away at eight o'clock, but instead of that I understand she went away at seven; when I came home, at half past eight, she was gone; the next morning I looked into the prisoner's engine drawer and it was then all right; she came to work before breakfast, she went down stairs between ten and eleven, I thought she was going to the privy, and in about ten minutes after I went to the drawer, and three knots of the pink silk were gone.
I am an officer; I took the prisoner into custody; I know her very well, she told me she had sold the silk to a person of the name of Foster, in Angel-alley; I got a warrant from the Lord Mayor, I went to Foster's, but they had absconded.
I Left it in the drawer.
