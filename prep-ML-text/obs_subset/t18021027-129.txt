I am a vintner, and keep a hotel in Oxendon-street ; the prisoner was my cook ; she came into my service on the 4th of August, and about a week after I missed a tablespoon, and about a week after that I missed a teaspoon, and between that and the 8th of October I lost the other articles mentioned in the indictmen (repeating them) I afterwards found three tablecloths and other things pledged at Mr. Brown's, in Penton-street; I had a five years character with her, as a sober, honest woman; but I found her mustly in liquor while she was in my service.
I am servant to Mr. Brown, in Penton-street
I intended to bring them back before they should be missed.
