You had no property but what belonged to you in that shop?
No.
Have you kept the jacket from that time to this?
The constable has.
What may be the value of it?
It is stated at three shillings and six-pence, that is under the value of it.
I am porter to Mr. Perry; Mr. Hayward came over to Mr. Perry's on purpose to see what they would do, and Mr. Perry asked him to come in, he suspected something, and my master said, there! there is somebody taking something away; he told Mr. Hayward to run, accordingly he did run, and overtook the prisoner at the bar at the corner; I see him run after the prisoner and see him stop him.
Did you see what the prisoner had on him?
They were wrestling together when I ran after him and the party he was darted from him almost, and I said stop my friend, you are not gone yet. By bringing him along towards the shop he dropped the flannel waistcoat from under his coat, a brown coat which he had on, I see him drop it, rather a loosish coat, he dropped the waistcoat and I picked it up and brought it into the shop, I left it there upon the counter.
I am a letter founder by business, and I am a constable and patrole in the ward of Cripplegate, the prisoner was taken before I went, Mr. Hayward gave me this waistcoat; I have kept it ever since.
You took the prisoner into custody I suppose?
I did.
This is my waistcoat.
Please you, my lord, I was going down Beech-street, between five and six in the evening, going to Barbican, a man ran past me and delivered the waistcoat into my arms, and before I could recover myself to see what it was, this gentleman came and took me.
