I am a taylor : I live at No. 2, Charles-court, Old Gravel-lane, St. Georges, Middlesex . The prisoner is a taylor , he worked for me three weeks, I let him sleep in the shop. I did not get up till eight o'clock on the 7th of January. I went into the shop, and missed these goods from out of the shop; I missed two trowsers cut out, but not made, two waistcoats, two pair of scissars, and a pair of cloth pantaloons, made up.
Was the prisoner in the house at the time you missed these articles.
No; he had slept there all night for what I know, till the morning; I traced him to a jew dealer in East Smithfield; the jew owned to having bought the articles of him, and produced them all, except the scissars. After making the discovery, I met with the prisoner in a public-house, and took him to the office, the officer searched him, and found two pair of scissars upon him. I saw all the articles on the evening before in my shop, and I saw the prisoner about five o'clock that evening. I do not know, of my own knowledge, at what time the prisoner broke out.
I am shopman to my father, he is a dealer in clothes, No. 70, Upper East Smithfield. On Sunday, the 7th instant. between eight and nine in the morning, he came into the shop, and asked, whether I would buy the goods; he told me he was a taylor, he worked with a man; he died, and these goods were given to him for the money that he owed him; upon that, I bought them, I gave twelve shillings for them; in about five minutes, John Ward came in, I produced the articles; he said, they were his. I was present when the scissars were taken from the prisoner's pockets. The waistcoats and trowsers were given to the prosecutor by my father.
