I am an surveyor belonging to the East-India Company; the prisoner was employed by the Company's porter s to unload the craft; there was the Two Henrys lighter lying at Ralph's-quay , close to a ship belonging to the Company; the lighter had sugar on board be longing to the Company. On the 16th of July last, between ten and eleven in the morning, I saw the prisoner on board, he was standing on one side of the scale board of sugar that was to be landed, and I on the other; I observed him shuffling with his hand behind him; seeing his hand come from behind him, I observed his hand covered with sugar, and the cuff of his coat, which raised a suspicion that he had been taking sugar; I said, what have you been after? he said, master I have only been taking a little sugar for some beer; I told him he knew he should no do that, and I immediately searched him, and found three pounds of sugar in his coat pocket; it belonged to the India Company; he begged forgiveness; I told him it was more than my place was worth of forgive him, and I sent for a constable; the prisoner endeavoured to make his escape before the constable came, he ran up to gateway where the constable was coming down; I said that is the man, and he stopped him; I saw it weighed, it weighed three pounds; (produces the sugar) I have no doubt of its being the Company's sugar; it is of the same quality.
I am a constable; I stopped the prisoner; he first offered me half a guinea, and then a guinea, to let him go.
I picked up the sugar as it scattered from a cart where the packages had broke.
