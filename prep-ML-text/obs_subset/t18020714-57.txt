I am the wife of William Granger , a carpenter ; the prisoner chairs for me; I missed a sheet and a table-cloth, sometime in April; a neighbour who lost some articles, suspected her; I went and found the things at a pawnbroker's.
I live with Mr. Sherrard, a pawnbroker; the prisoner pawned the things now claimed by Mr. Granger, on the 29th of March.
On the 17th of June, I took the prisoner into custody, she acknowledged her guilt, and took me to the pawnbroker's.
