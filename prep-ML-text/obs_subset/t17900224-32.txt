I am a carpenter. I know Mr. Thomas Ball 's house; he lives at Islington . On the 12th of January, I saw the lead the day before safe on the house; the pipe was cut away, and carried some way off from the cellar and the yard; about forty pounds weight: the prisoner I took in the cellar: the house was repairing for him; he had not slept in it yet.
Then there is an end of this indictment.
