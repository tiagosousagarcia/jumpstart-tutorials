On Thursday, the 24th of April, I lost an iron pallisade from my house; I had lost eight before; and as I was sitting writing at my desk, I thought I heard a wrench; I then went to the door, and before I could get it open the men were gone; I went back and examined the rail, and found one fresh loosened; I then thought he would return; I placed myself behind the glass-door ready to go out; I then saw the prisoner return; I distinguished him by his leather apron, which was tucked round him; I saw him take the bar out; it was fixed in a fence belonging to my dwelling-house; I instantly opened the door and ran up the steps, there are three steps up to the door, and followed the prisoner; he had the bar in his hand; I saw him stoop and put it down upon the kirb, and as he rose again I seized him; that was against the next house to my own; I then sent for a constable; I went out and picked the bar up; I never lost sight of him at all; he first attempted to get away form me; he struggled a good deal, and I tore his waistcoat.
I am a constable: (produces the bar;) I received it form Mr. Taylor, I have kept it ever since.
I am as innocent as a child unborn; I had no tools to cut it away with, not even a knife; they searched me and I had nothing about me; the gentleman said, you rascal, I have been robbed so many times that I will send you to Botany Bay.
Did you find any tools about him?
No, it was done without; the stone work had been fresh chipped away; I saw him take it out.
