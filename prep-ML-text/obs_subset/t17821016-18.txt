I keep the Yorkshire Stingo, in the New-Road, Paddington ; on the 18th of September my servant had been out in the morning, the prisoner came in, and called for a pint of beer, and my servant was asking the prisoner what he was doing with that pewter dish, he had a basket, and I insisted on seeing it uncovered, there were several pewter plates; I looked at one of them, and found it was mine; I saw the plates were gone off the pewter shelf before. I took the prisoner to the Rotation Office immediately, from thence he was sent to Clerkenwell. There were fourteen in number, I saw them on the shelf that morning.
I was laying down almost asleep on the table. I heard the pewter rattling, I saw the prisoner first take down one plate, and then seven; then he took down a pewter dish, that was too big for his basket; he put the seven plates into his basket, and picked them up one at a time, I lay as if I was asleep.
I went into the public-house, and called for some liquor, I was very much in liquor; how the plates came into my basket, I do not know.
What way of life have you been in?
I lived five years with Lord Exeter, and three years with the Earl of Warwick, and with the Duke of Chandos, as footman.
How came you to be reduced so low as this?
I have had a great deal of sickness: I have been a hay-making, I left my fork at a gentlemen's house.
