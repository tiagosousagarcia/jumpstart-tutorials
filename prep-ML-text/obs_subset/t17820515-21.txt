On Monday last, at about two or three minutes before two o'clock at noon, as I was walking up Warwick-lane , I felt the flap of my coat turned up; I looked round, and saw the prisoner with my handkerchief in his hand; I immediately collared him; he then dropped it: while I stopped to pick the handkerchief up from the ground, I observed him to put his right hand hastily into his coat pocket; that occasioned me to suspect he had taken other handkerchiefs; I immediately secured both his arms; he struggled to get his right hand out of his pocket, but I held it fast, and forced him in that manner before me down to the bottom of the lane, to the house of Mr. Proctor, who is beadle of the ward; I desired Mr. Proctor to search him before I let him go, and particularly his right-hand pocket: in that pocket he found a large clasp knife open, and nothing else. The prisoner was in liquor at the time; otherwise I am persuaded he would have got the knife out of his pocket, before I could have secured his arm. I desired Mr. Proctor to take him to the Compter, and he was ordered for trial.
I searched the prisoner; I found this knife (producing it) it was open in his right-hand pocket; he had nothing else in that pocket. In his other pocket, I found a leather strap. He said he knew nothing about it. He was very much in liquor.
Did he say what purpose he had the knife in his pocket for?
Not then; but going along, he said he had it to cut his leather strap.
I should be glad to go to sea.
