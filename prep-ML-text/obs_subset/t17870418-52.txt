I am servant to the prosecutor; on the 23d of March last I was in the parlour, and had rubbed the things mentioned in the indictment, which lay on a little sideboard; the street-door was open, and the prisoner came in softly, and took them; he did not see me; he put them in his pocket, and put a mug under his coat; I ran after him, and he turned round and hit me with the mug on the head, and again on the side; he ran away, and I lost him; he was taken the next morning; the things were never found; I am sure he is the person.
I took the prisoner out of sixteen the next day, at the Marquis of Granby, in Chick-lane.
I am innocent.
