I am a baker , No. 11, Mansfield-street, Goodman's-fields : On the 18th of August, about a quarter before six o'clock in the afternoon, I had seen my watch; about six o'clock I was coming out of the bake-house, and saw the prisoner run out of the parlour round the counter; I had left my wife in the parlour, which goes out of the shop, but she had stepped into the kitchen close by; I called out, but he never turned to make any answer; I pursued him up Swan-street into a court, which is no thoroughfare, and collared him; I opened his hand, and took out a seven-shilling piece, and twopence, which I cannot say was mine; the watch was found in about five minutes.
I was going past the prosecutor's, and saw the prisoner go through the shop into the parlour, the parlour windows were open next the street, and I saw into the room; I saw him take something off the mantle-piece, and return instantly through the shop into the street; Mr. Crawley followed him, and I run with him.
I live in Chapman's-court; my little boy, not six years old, picked the watch up in the court, in a corner where the prisoner was taken.
At the first hearing, before the Magistrate, she said she never saw me in the court; I saw some people running up the court, and I run with them; I am innocent of the robbery.
