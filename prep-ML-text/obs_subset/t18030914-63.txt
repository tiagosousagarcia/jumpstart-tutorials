- I am a carpenter ; On Tuesday the 6th of September, I was at No. 42, Grosvenor-place ; my chest was in the building; the prisoner was a labourer ; I gave my watch to John Hill to put into his chest; he told me where the key was before the prisoner; I went to the fair, and went home to the building, and slept there; in the morning John Hill said somebody had been at the chest; I said, no! we examined the chest, and my watch was gone.
- He confirmed the last witness.
I was sentry, and saw a man come out of the building about two o'clock, who I believe to be the prisoner; the moon as shining bright; he was taken into custody, d the duplicate found on him.
I searched the priner, and found a duplicate, and half a guinea in his mouth.
The prisoner gave me the watch to pawn, and I gave him the money.
I found the watch.
