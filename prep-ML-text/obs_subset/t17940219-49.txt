Did the patrole shew them to you?
He did at the Rotation office.
I am a patrole of St. Margaret's. On the 16th, about eleven o'clock at night, I was crossing of old Peter-street, there was a stranger stood by my side, he said, there is a bundle gone into Lane-court, and he went and I followed him to the
door, and I knocked at the door, after knocking some time, Jackson opened the door, where of I asked him what became of that bundle he brought in? he said he brought no bundle in at all, with that I looked about the place, and moved the bed about, and at the foot of the bed, in an old deal box, I found the bundle.
How did you know this was his room?
He said he came in that afternoon. I asked him where he got the bundle? - I found in this bundle a pair of sheets, a gown, and three clouts; he said, he picked them up in Peter-street, coming from his mother's; I carried them to the office.
I know the gown, here is a piece of the same; I can swear to the clouts, one has a mark on it.
How far is this man's house from the prosecutor's?
About one hundred yards, or not so much.
I left my work at six o'clock and went home to my lodgings, and had my supper; after that I went to my mother's for a clean pair of stockings, and stayed at my mother's within ten minutes of eleven o'clock; coming from there to my lodgings, there was a man came along with a bundle in his hand, as soon as he saw me he dropped the bundle and ran away; I said to him you have dropped your bundle; and he said nothing, but kept running; I stood by it for five minutes, and then I took it up and went home, and went to go to bed. I was undressing myself when the gentleman knocked at the door and I opened the door immediately.
