I am in partnership with Mr. Hawley. On the 6th of this month I saw a trunk, directed to the care of Mr. Foot, lying upon our wharf. Soon after I went to Change, and on my return I was informed that the trunk had been stolen off the wharf.
I am clerk to Messrs. Hawley and Downes. On the 6th of this month about three o'clock in the afternoon, as I was returning from dinner, I met the prisoner at the bar in the street with the trunk upon his back. I had seen it landed at eight o'clock in the morning; it came from Perth, and was landed upon my master's wharf. I stopped him and got it from his shoulders; he seemed as if he would have made off, but I secured him and took him and the trunk back to the wharf.
On the 6th of September a trunk was landed at my master's wharf, directed to Thomas Graham , Esq. to the care of Henry Foot . I saw it upon the wharf between one and two o'clock.
Has the prisoner any thing to do with your wharf?
Nothing at all. This is the trunk which was landed at our wharf.
This is the trunk I found upon the prisoner.
I came out of Scotland in a sloop. I came down to Wapping to seek a ship which was going farther on. I came to two or three wharfs to seek for a ship. A man came dressed in a blue coat, with a small ribbon about his hat; he asked me where I came from? I said from Scotland. I had come only that day. He said he would give me sixpence if I would carry this trunk about forty yards because he did not choose to carry it; as I was carrying it one of these gentlemen stopped me and said it did not belong to me. I said it belonged to that gentleman.
To Newhall, When you stopped him what did he say to you?
I asked him who gave him the trunk; he said a man with a laced hat. I said you shall go back with this trunk and see if you can find the man.
