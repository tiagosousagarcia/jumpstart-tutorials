I live in Rosemary-lane , the window of my house was open the 23d of March, between eight and nine in the evening; I was sitting by the fire, I heard a noise in the chamber, I went to the back door, and saw a man in the street, with his face towards the window, I saw my window open which was fastened before; I left a friend to watch and went up stairs, and he cried out, here he is! I found my drawers open and the bed and bed clothes in the front garret, rolled up in the middle of the floor; I came down, and the prisoner was in hold by my friend, I took him in doors and searched him, I found nothing on him: there was great appearance of his having got in at the window; he did not slip into the house, the street door was never open: there is a back door that goes into Saltpetre-bank, I cannot say, whether that was open or shut in the day time.
I stood to watch the window, and I saw the prisoner put out his leg, to come out of the window, he dropped, and I secured him.
I never was in the house, I was coming by; I never was a thief.
