I keep a perfumer and jeweller's shop , in Fleet-street : On the 7th of this month, about nine o'clock in the morning, an alarm was given by a lad belonging to the Courier office, that two people were cutting our window, I looked through the glass door, and saw the prisoner at the window; I missed the things directly as the boy was taken into custody; I examined the window, and the glass was broke about the size of a crown piece, these things had laid close to the hole.
What is the value of them?
About six shillings.
I am an apprentice to Mr. Dewdney: Yesterday week, a little after nine, a lad came to our house and gave the information that two people were cutting our glass, I was in the work-shop, at the back of the shop; I went out and saw the prisoner standing near the broken square of glass; I had seen the window at eight o'clock, when I opened shop, it was perfectly found then; I charged the prisoner with breaking the window.
What was he doing?
Standing looking up and down Fleet-street, and in at the shop door; I laid hold of him, and he was taken before the constable, and searched, but we found none of our property upon him.
Yesterday week I saw the prisoner and another coming up Fleet-street; they stopped at Mr. Vale's, the persumer's, a few minutes, they saw somebody in the shop, and came away again; then they went up to Mr. Dewdney's, they were walking backwards and forwards from the picture-shop and thereabouts, near an hour; I saw the other that was with him, run his hand along the glass several times, I do not know what he did, the prisoner stood before him all the while he did it; I saw that, and ran down stairs directly; I went over to Mr. Dewdney's, and saw there was a hole cut in the window, and I informed Mr. Dewdney of it.
I was going along about my business; I happened to stop looking at some rings in the window, when they laid hold of me; they know I was by myself.
