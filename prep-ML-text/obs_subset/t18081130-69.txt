I live at No. 15, Carburton street ; the prisoner lived with me about two months and a fortnight.
When was it you lost these things
At different times; the prisoner pledged the articles.
I am a pawnbroker, I live in Tottenham court road; three sheets, a table cloth, a shift, and petticoat, were pawned by the prisoner, at various times, for seventeen shillings and sixpence.
My lord, her name is not Osborne; she owes me a guinea, that a gentleman left for me, and a fortnight's wages; that gentleman kept her; I nursed him; I did not pledge the things with an intention to wrong her; she owes me a guinea and a fortnight's wages.
Is your name Osborne
Yes.
Do you owe her a guinea
I do not; I paid her her wages the day I had her taken up, on the 15th of October; and on that night she pledged one of the sheets.
She is a jewess - she lived with a gentletleman, called Mr. Osborne.
