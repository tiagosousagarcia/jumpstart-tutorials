- I am a victualler , in Tabernacle-walk, Finsbury-square: On Monday, the 26th of October, between five and six o'clock in the evening, I was returning home from the City; I stopped to see the soldiers exercising in Moorfields ; a woman, with a child in her arms, tapped me on the shoulder, and told me a man had picked my pocket of a handkerchief; I felt in my pocket, and found my handkerchief, but missed my pocket-book; the woman pointed out the prisoner to me; I pursued him, and took him, with my pocket-book concealed under his left arm; I took him to Worship-street.
He had done it so clumsily, that the woman saw him do it?
Yes.
I saw the pocket-book taken from under the prisoner's coat.
I picked up the pocket-book, and several people who saw me pick it up, claimed half of it.
