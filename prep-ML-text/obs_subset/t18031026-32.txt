- I am a farrier ; I lodge at No. 1, Queen's-head-court, Great Wind mill-street; I lodged with one Macdonald, who kept a coal-shed: On the 27th of August, I received a twenty-five pound Bank-note, which I gave to my sister, and a one-pound Bank-note besides; she lived at No. 4, Mark-lane, at that time; she left her place on the 2d of September, and lodged with the prisoner three nights.
I am sister to the last witness; my brother gave me twenty-five pounds on the 27th of August to take care of; I left my place on the 2d of September, and was recommended by my sister to go to lodge with the prisoner; she lived at No. 3, Hewist's court, in the Strand ; I slept there three nights: On the 4th of September I had the note; on the 5th, I went to my place, near Battersea; I looked into my box to see that every thing was safe, and missed my pocket-book, which contained the money; I missed a twenty-five pound note, and a one-pound note; the next morning I went to my brother; that is all I know.
I am servant to Mr. Corby, pawnbroker, Green-street, Leicester-square: On the 6th of September, the prisoner at the bar bought some cotton handkerchiefs, and I exchanged a twenty-five pound note for her; I have not the least doubt of her being the person; she gave me the name of Griffiths, which I put upon the note; it was in the middle of the day.
I am librarian to the Bank of England; I brought this note from the Bank.
This is the same note; it has upon it, in my writing, Griffiths, No. 17, York-buildings, 6th of the ninth month.
Is that the note?
I cannot say; I did not take notice of the number.
I know this to be the same note that I gave my sister; it has Masterman and George Talser wrote upon it.
I never had such a thing in my possession.
