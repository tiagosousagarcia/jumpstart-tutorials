I am a smith , in Sun-street, Bishopsgate-street : On Friday the 18th of April, the prisoner was at work for me at a gentleman's house in Houndsditch; he went away to dinner at one o'clock, and returned at two; he went out, and took with him the things mentioned in the indictment; I saw them in the shop before he went out; I have not seen them since, nor the prisoner, till he was taken up last Friday was a week; there were two other men in the shop at the time.
I am an apprentice to Mr. Budd: The prisoner went out to a job, he got his materials ready by dinner-time, and he came back with his pliers, which he had no call to have done; he employed himself in a frivolous job concerning his pliers; I had occasion for a tool, and I went to his vice-board, and I saw him spread his apron upon the vice-board, in order to take his tools and materials for the job; he was in the act of putting them in when I left the vice-board; I saw him go out at the back-door near his vice-board, with his apron loaded, to go to his job, as I thought; he was not seen again till Friday the 23d of May, when he was taken up by the officer; he left us on Friday the 18th of April; he came on Wednesday the 16th.
I am an apprentice to Mr. Budd: I saw the prisoner lay his apron upon the vice-board, and putting the things into his apron; I saw him afterwards go out at the back-door, his apron seemed to be quite full, and he went down the ladder; I saw no more of the prisoner till the officer took him up.
I am an officer of the City: On the 23d of May, a gentleman gave me charge of the of a prisoner, in Ironnonger-lane, for robbing Mr. Budd of a quantity of goods; I searched him, and found a picklock-key, and some scutcheons of a door, upon him.
I never saw the things.
What may be the value of these tools?
Twenty-five shillings.
