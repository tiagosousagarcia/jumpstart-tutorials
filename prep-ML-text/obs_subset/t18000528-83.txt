I am the wife of John Roberts , I live in Sun-yard, East-Smithfield , the prisoner at the bar was a servant of mine; I went out on a Sunday, about half-past ten; I left the prisoner in care of the house; when I returned, I missed a gown and petticoat, and some other things that are not found; they were locked up in a drawer in the room, and the prisoner was gone; I saw them again in about three weeks after, when I saw the prisoner in Catherine-wheel-alley, Whitechapel.
On Tuesday the 29th of April, I apprehended the prisoner in Essex-street, Whitechapel, formerly called Catherine-wheel-alley; I brought her to the office, and took this gown off her back; she was rather in liquor that evening, and I was ordered by the Magistrate to put her in the watch-house that night, and the next morning I asked her what she had done with the other things that she had taken from Mrs. Roberts; she said she had not taken so many things as Mrs. Roberts said she had, there was only two gowns and one petticoat more; I asked her if she had pledged or sold them, she said, no; she had left them at the Weaver's-arms, Whitechapel-road, with the landlady of the house, for eighteen shillings; I went to the Weaver's-arms, and the landlady produced them to me; I brought them to the office, and Mrs. Roberts claimed them.
I am the wife of John Burt , I live at the Weaver's-arms; the woman that goes under the denomination of the prisoner's mother, brought the duplicates of these things to me, she is a tenant of mine, she rents some of the out premises belonging to me; I sent a person with the duplicates, and these things were brought to me for them, they cost me a guinea and nine-pence altogether; she wanted to borrow money of me first.
This woman keeps a house of ill same; I was in the work-house, and this woman would let me have no rest till I came to her house; she lent me these things for the use of the house, keeping a bad house; and I ran away after she had made away with all my things.
