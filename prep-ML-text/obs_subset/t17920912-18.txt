I know the prisoner, I was present when she was tried in October, 1787, for stealing goods of Mr. Jackson, and was capitally convicted; in June, 1789, she received the King's pardon, on condition of being transported for seven years; I delivered her on board the Lady Juliana; she escaped soon after from the ship in Long Reach.
I apprehended the prisoner in Billings-court, Petticoat-lane, on the 9th of August last; I found her in bed, in consequence of an information; she appeared unwell; Joseph Bear was in company with me, Joseph Bear said that the woman sold old clothes, and behaved exceedingly well.
