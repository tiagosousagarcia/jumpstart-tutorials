I was in the compting-house of Mr. Gaston, on the 29th of March, in the afternoon, while the men were gone to dinner, and whilst I was there, somebody called out, that a man had stole one of the blocks that hung at the door; I ran and saw the prisoner taken with the block on his shoulder; it was my master's, it hung at the door, and there was a block missing from the door; I went in danger of my life, and the prisoner was very rude; I stopped him, and shut him up in the compting-house, and kept him there till Francis came.
I assisted in taking the prisoner.
I was asked to carry a load.
