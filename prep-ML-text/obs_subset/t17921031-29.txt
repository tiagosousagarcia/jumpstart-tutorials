On the 20th of October, in Suffolk Mews , I lost my master's great coat from the coach box; I had seen it not three minutes before; I am coachman to Mr. Howard; I saw the prisoner drop the coat.
I saw the prisoner take the coat off the box, and put it in his apron; I had seen him loitering about; I am a breeches maker by trade.
I saw the prisoner drop the coat.
