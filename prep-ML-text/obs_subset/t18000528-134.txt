I am the wife of Thomas Hall , who keeps the Green Dragon in Bishopsgate-street : On Saturday the 17th of May, between four and five in the afternoon, the prisoner came in for a pennyworth of gin; I served her and she put down sixpence, and I gave her change; I put the sixpence in my mouth, and she went away; I was reckoning up a score, and when I had done that I discovered it to be a bad one; on the Monday following she came to my house again for a pennyworth of gin; I served her, and she gave me another sixpence; my blood turned at seeing her again; says I, you wicked bussey, I will charge an officer with you, and punish you; me, says she, and ran away directly; I kept the sixpence in my hand till I delivered it to Sapwell; my servant and I ran after her; she got in between some carts, a good way up Houndsditch, before she was stopped; I never lost fight of her.
I never was in the house before that Monday; I had a pain in my belly, which I am subject to, and I went in to get a pennyworth of gin; I did not know it was a bad sixpence.
