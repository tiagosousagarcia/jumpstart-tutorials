I did go out with the prisoner; I was in liquor; I had the articles mentioned in the indictment; I fell asleep; I awoke; I was disturbed by the prisoner putting her hand into my waistcoat pocket; I missed my things; I went to the watchman without a hat and handkerchief; the watchman went with me; I found a coat tied up in a silk handkerchief, and another handkerchief; I gave it to the constable; he has kept it ever since.
I am a constable. This is the property I received from the prosecutor; I found a hat under the stairs in the passage, in the same house where the things were found.
I am an unfortunate woman. This man met me as I was going home; he gave me these things to take care of.
