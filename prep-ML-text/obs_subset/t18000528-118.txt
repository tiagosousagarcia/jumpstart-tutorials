I am a hairdresser , No. 10, Type-street, Finsbury-square : On Thursday the 1st of May, my business called me out between five and six in the morning; when I returned, I found my shop broke into; I searched, and found the prisoner concealed in the cellar; part of the things were lying down by him, the remainder of the things were found in a washhouse; his friends are very well off, he has been in the capacity of a clerk , he has turned out very wild and has got through it; I have known him some time, (produces the property;) they are all mine, I had seen them that morning.
The prisoner got through my parlour into Mr. Jefferson's-shop, the wash-house joins the cellar, he went from the wash-house down to the cellar, I did not see him in the cellar, I was frightened, and shut the door.
Mr. Jefferson came home and missed some things, we found some of them in the wash-house; then we went down into the cellar, Hancock went first, and found the man there, we both secured him, I never knew him before.
I am innocent of the crime, I know nothing of the things.
