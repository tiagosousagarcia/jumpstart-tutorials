Examined by Mr. Beville. I am porter to Messrs. Hawkes: On Saturday last, about half past two o'clock, I saw two soldier s come down the wharf; presently after, I saw one of them, which was the prisoner, return with a bag of nails upon his shoulder; I immediately pursued him, and caught him at Puddle-dock, in Thames-street; I asked him where he was going with that bag of nails; he said he did not know; I then took him back to Mr. Hawkes's wharf, Mr. Hawkes was present.
I am a constable.
This is the bag of nails that I took from the prisoner.
We are iron manufacturer s: On Saturday last, about half past two o'clock in the afternoon, I was sent for into the yard; I found the prisoner surrounded by two or three men, with the bag of nails by his side; he acknowledged his guilt.
Did you, or any body in your hearing, recommend it to him to confess?
Nothing of the kind passed in my hearing; he said, it was his first offence, that he was induced to do it by the persuasions of a man that had taken away a bag before; I asked him where he was going to take it; he said for sale; he would let me know every particular if I would but promise to forgive him; I told him I would promise him nothing but prosecution; I made no other promise; there was a bag of nails missing that day, to my own knowledge.
On Saturday last, a man asked me if I wanted a job; I said, yes; and he took me down this yard, shewed me the job, and told me to carry it over Blackfriars-bridge; upon that, he took the bag of nails and put them upon my back; I had not gone but a very few paces before I was taken into custody; I have served his Majesty five years in the Guards, and was never taken into custody before; I hope your Lordship, and the Gentlemen of the Jury, will shew me lenity now.
