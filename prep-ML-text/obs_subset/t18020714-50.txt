I am a hatter, servant to Mr. William Morgan , New-street, Coventgarden ; the prisoner came into our shop on Tuesday, the 29th of June, between nine and ten o'clock; I was not in the shop, being at work below stairs; a bell was rung for me to come up; when I came up, the prisoner wanted to see some hats; I shewed him this one, (producing it,) and another; this he did not approve, the other he did; I just turned my back to get a stamp, and I saw him go out of the shop with this hat on his head; I ran after him, and stopped him, not more than a quarter of a mile from our house, on my taking hold of him, he immediately gave me the hat; it was Mr. Morgan's hat; it had neither band, buckle, nor stamp, by which I knew it; he gave a spring, as if surprized; I am certain this is the same hat; when he came back to the shop, I gave him his old hat which he had left there; he had not paid for any hat.
I am a carpenter; I was passing by at the time; I stopped at the door of Mr. Morgan's to see what was the matter; we were taking the prisoner to Bow-street, and at the corner of James-street, the prisoner said to Jenkins, where are you going, he answered, going to Bow-street; the prisoner then ran away, I ran after him, and caught him by the collar.
I went into the shop to purchase a hat, I did not know what I did as I was in liquor.
