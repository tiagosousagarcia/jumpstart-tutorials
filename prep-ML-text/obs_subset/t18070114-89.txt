I am a carpenter . On the 10th of January, about eleven in the morning, I lost my plane from a house that I was at work in, Cole yard, Drury lane . I went out to speak to the plumber, it was safe then, I was gone five minutes; I returned and the plane was gone.
I am a bricklayer, I was at work about five yards from the place. The prisoner came and spoke to me; he walked away and took this plane, I called my labourer to take him; he threw down the plane within four feet of where he took it up; I saw him take it, I have kept the plane ever since.
I never saw the plane till it was shewn me.
