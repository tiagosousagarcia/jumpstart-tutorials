Upon Thursday the 23d of December as I was passing between Temple-Bar and St. Dunstan's church , the prisoner came up to me and said to me, how do you do; I stopped and looked at her; I thought it had been an acquaintance from Brentwood; I found it was not. She asked me to go with her and drink a glass of wine; I refused; she clasped me round the waist, I still refused to go with her. I got from her and walked on as far as St. Paul's church. I there felt in my pocket, and missed my pocket-book; I returned back, thinking to find the prisoner, but could not, till the next night, then I took her into custody; I had her into St. Clement's watch-house; I charged the watch with her. The next day we went before Sir John Fielding , and upon my oath he committed her.
Was she searched?
No.
Never?
No; it being the next night we thought it was made away with.
The pocket-book was not found upon her?
No. It was in my inside pocket; I had it in my pocket a minute before I met her.
I have known the prisoner between six and seven years; she always bore a very honest just character. My husband was a master tailor; he has been dead four years; I carry on the business. The prisoner is a married woman; I have made clothes for her husband.
I have known the prisoner about twenty-two years. She bears a very honest character; I never heard any thing amiss of her in my life. I am a married woman, and have lived in the county of Middlesex seventeen years.
I am a mantua-maker. I have known the prisoner seventeen years; I never heard any thing against her before.
