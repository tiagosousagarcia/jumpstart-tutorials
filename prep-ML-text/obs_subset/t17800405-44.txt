I live in Jermyn-street . The prisoner worked for my wife in the milinery business at her own lodging. This watch used to hang against my wife's bed, in the bed-chamber; it was missed in the month of June, 1778. We had a black girl we suspected. The watch was forgot till lately a discovery was made of it by one Mr. Wilson, a jeweller. It was traced to the hands of a Mr. Trip, in St. Martin's-lane.
I am a pawnbroker in St. Martin's-lane. This French gold watch (producing it) was pledged with me on the 13th of May, 1778, by a woman, in the name of Ann Brown. I have no recollection of her person. There was a gold seal and a ring pawned by the same person the same day.
The prisoner told me she had a gold watch in pawn at Mr. Trip's, and wished my husband would buy it out. My husband took the duplicate, and he went to enquire about it, but could not obtain a sight of it. I went to Mr. Wilson's, who had been a friend to her, and mentioned the watch, and he told Mr. Bouvais of it.
I had the duplicate of my wife for the purpose of making that enquiry.
Mr. Bouvais came to Sir John Fielding 's and laid an information about the watch, and I went and found it at Mr. Trip's.
I have no friend here. I am a Scotch-woman.
Is Mr. Wilson here?
No.
