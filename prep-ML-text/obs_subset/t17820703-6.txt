I live in Broad-court, Covent-garden . I went out of town on the 9th of May. I saw the plate, mentioned in the indictment, on the side-board, in my parlour, before I went out. I returned on the 10th of May. The plate had been missed just before I returned.
What was the whole worth?
I valued it at 20 l. I have never seen any of it since.
I live at a house opposite the prosecutor's. On the day Mr. Lewis's house was robbed, I saw the prisoner walk by Mr. Lewis's door two or three times; and he made a full stop, and looked at Mr. Lewis's child, which was then sitting at the door. He walked to Cross-court, which leads into Broad-court; then he walked back to Mr. Lewis's, and looked into the window. He made a full stop; and then he pushed open the door, and went into the house. I never saw him come out again. I thought the prisoner might have been a sweetheart to one of the maids. In about ten minutes after I saw the prisoner, I heard of the robbery.
I was at that time servant to Mr. Lewis. The plate was kept open, upon a side-board, in the parlour. I saw the prisoner go backwards and forwards past the house three times, and look into the parlour. I was up in the dining-room at the time. It was not above six minutes after the last time I saw him, before the plate was missed.
I was at the Office, in Bow-street, when Mrs. Lewis came with an information of the man who had robbed them. At that time another man was supposed to be concerned, from the description given by the servant. Somebody at the office said Barrett was the man.
