I am the wife of George Kennedy ; I live in King Edward-street, Wapping . While I was sitting in the kitchen I heard a whispering in the parlour; I went up and saw the
prisoner making his escape out of the parlour window. I got up to him before he got out of the window and laid hold of the heel of his shoe; he gave me a shove and said blast you let me go, and he got out at the window. I called out stop thief! and he was taken and brought back in two or three minutes with the hings mentioned in the indictment upon him
Are you sure the prisoner is the person?
Yes; to the best of my knowledge he is. I had a candle in my hand and looked him full in the face.
As I was going into King Edward-street, I heard Mrs. Kennedy calling out of the window
\"stop thief! stop thief! the lord
\"knows what the thief has got.\" I looked round and saw the prisoner with a bag under his right arm, and a bonnet in his left hand. I pursued him and just as I was going to lay hold of him, he threw the bundle in my face and turned back and ran down King Edward-street again. I had a full view of his face; I am sure the prisoner is the person.
I heard the cry of stop thief! I went to the door and saw the prisoner running; I laid hold of him; he slipped out of his coat and got from me, but was immediately secured by another person.
I saw the prisoner running; he dropped his hat, I took it up and pursued him. When he was brought back he asked for his hat and I gave it him.
I pursued the prisoner and saw him taken.
I leave my defence to my counsel.
