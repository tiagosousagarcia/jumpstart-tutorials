I am a taylor and salesman ; I lost a coat on the 8th of December, about four o'clock; I missed a coat, and turning about I saw the prisoner running up Lascelles-place with the coat under his arm; I pursued and took him; I never lost sight of him.
I was coming up, and saw a crowd; a man said, if you will take my comrade's coat into a publick-house, I will give you a pot of beer; I had no sooner got it under my arm than this gentleman seized me.
