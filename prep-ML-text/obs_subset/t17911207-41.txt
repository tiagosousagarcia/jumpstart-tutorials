I am a constable on the quays; I stopped the prisoner with a half-hundred weight; it is the property of the King; it was concealed in a something.
I am one of the appointers of the weighers; this weight (the weight produced) belongs to the King; there is no doubt about it.
Coming over London-bridge, a man asked me to carry this weight to East-Smithfield, and he would give me a shilling.
