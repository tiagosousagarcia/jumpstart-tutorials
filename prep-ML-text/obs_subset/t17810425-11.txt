I am a linen-draper in New Bond-street . On the 23d of February, while I was sitting in my back-parlour, I heard the sound of a foot in the shop; I looked, and saw the prisoner going out with a piece of cloth under his arm; he walked gently out; I pursued him; then he ran: in turning a corner, he went with force against the corner, which drove him over the way, and he dropped the cloth; he was pursued by other people, and brought back: I am sure he is the man that dropped the cloth.
I live in Marybone-lane. About the 23d of January I was going down Bond-street to Mr. Bolton's, the Golden Cross, at Charing-Cross, to agree to paint some carriages, about the hour of eight; there was an outcry of Stop thief! I saw a parcel of people running in Bond-street; I ran after them; I went up another street, leading to Oxford-Road; there was a man laid hold of me, and charged me with taking a piece of linen out of a draper's shop.
I have known him seven months; he always bore a good character.
