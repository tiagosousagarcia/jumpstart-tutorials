I lost two dimity petticoats, the one is corded, the other is dimity, one shirt, an out lining of a bed-gown, they were in the back wash-house.
In whose house?
Martha Staples ; I know they were there, she washed them for me; I was not gone up two minutes from the back kitchen, where they were, in Virginia-street, about five o'clock, on the 18th of December; I am a married woman, my husband's name is William Marshall ; the prisoner was taken with them at the door.
I leave it to your lordship's mercy, I never did such a thing before.
