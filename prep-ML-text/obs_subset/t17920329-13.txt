I am wife of Robert Rayner ; he is a gentleman's servant ; I take in washing; I lost two shirts, and one handkerchief, the 22d of March, off the rails in the garden; I saw them about ten minutes before, or hardly so much; the prisoner was taken; I never saw him on the premises; the things are mine; they belong to Mr. Wigley, in Portland-street; I had them to wash.
I was out gathering some pots; I saw the man run through a hedge from Mrs. Rayner's, and across a field; I asked him what business he had in the fields scaling the hedges down; he said, there was no road; then some more people were after him; I ran and jumped over a river, and he ran back, and he was taken; I was a hundred yards behind; nothing was found on him.
I took the prisoner; I was walking in the fields, and was informed what he had done; before I took him I saw him throw the two shirts and handkerchief out of his pocket; the man that picked them up is not here; he was taken in about half an hour, about a mile off; he did not go half a dozen yards after he threw the things away; I can say they are the same things he dropt; I saw them taken up directly (these are the same); I marked them.
I saw the prisoner take a shirt off the pales; I gave the alarm.
I came out of the country for work, and going through this little village (Bayswater) I saw some people running after somebody, and I stopped, and they ran up to me and took me, and chastised me with it; I have no witnesses.
Where do you come from?
Droitwich, in Worcestershire.
