I am servant to Mr. Brotheroyd, who keeps a public-house . The prisoner came into our house, and had a pennyworth of beer. When she went out, I suspected she had taken something. I followed her, and found a quart pot under her arm, and she had her cloak over it. When she was committed, I went up to her room, and found two quart pots there. Since that, a pan for melting, and some pieces of metal, have been found in her room.
As to the two quart pots, I know nothing of them: I never melted a pot in my life.
