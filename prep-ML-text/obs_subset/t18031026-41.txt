- I live at No. 43, St. John's-street : On the 26th of September, I stepped out of my house about three minutes, and when I came back, the prisoner stood in the middle of the shop; he asked me if I had any children's chairs; I asked him if he would have a basket chair, or a wooden one; he made me no answer; I took an oak-stick to reach a chair, and saw my watch was gone from the book in the parlour; he said, he would call again; I suspected he had taken the watch; I took him by the collar, and called my son; he took him into the parlour, and I went for a constable.
I took the prisoner into the parlour; I told him he should be searched, and then he produced the watch out of his left-hand breeches pocket.
I cannot say any thing in my own defence; I am a man greatly afflicted with a rupture, and very poor.
