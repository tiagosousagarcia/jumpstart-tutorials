- I live at Hendon; I am a gardener : The prisoner lodges at Hendon , in the same room with John Farrant , in the house of John Maddocks ; I lost a pair of buckles and a pair of shoes last Wednesday was a week, in the morning, I had seen them on Tuesday night, in the kitchen; I saw them the same day that I lost them, on William Dean 's feet.
- The prisoner lodged in the same room with me, he is a gardener; I accidentally met with him in Kent-street, with the shoes and buckles upon his feet, about four hours after Bright missed his property.
Do you know whose they were?
I do not know any further than when Bright came in, he said, they were his; he was with me in pursuit of the prisoner.
What time in the morning did the prisoner go out?
I cannot say, I was asleep; I awoke about half after five o'clock.
How came you to go to Kent-street?
We went in pursuit of him.
Did you ever hear of his being there before?
Yes.
