I know nothing of the robbery.
I am the wife of John Groves , I lost the things named in the indictment at different times; I live at No. 130. Drury-lane ; On the 2d of October, I had missed a table-spoon, the prisoner's sister lodged with me, I went to the prisoner's lodgings, with a constable, and found some things in her box that I believe to be mine, a shirt that has Mr. Groves's name upon it, some of the handkerchiefs are marked; a pair of worsted stockings, a linen apron, marked; the other things have no mark.
You do not know that the box in which these things were found was the prisoner's?
No; I do not.
It was a room occupied by the prisoner's brother and his wife?
Yes.( Robert Beresford , the officer who bad possession of the property, was called, but not appearing, his recognizance was ordered to be estreated.)
