I lost a watch on the 31st of January last, it was a silver watch, in a double case, and a chain and seal, and key and hook, in Drury-lane , in the prisoner's apartment, No. 37; he was a lodger, I have known him two or three years, but never was in his company before that night; I was drinking with him at a public house in Castle-street, Long Acre, I was much in liquor; he asked me to come home with him, as I was in liquor I did go; I had my watch in my pocket in his apartment, I sat down and fell asleep above an hour; I missed my watch, and asked him for it, he said he had not got it, I insisted upon having it, he told me, if I would meet him the next morning in Russel court, he would give it me if he had it; at nine the next morning he sent for me and said he would take me to the place where it was in Whitehorse-yard, he pawned it for a guinea; the pawnbroker has it here, one John Lane .
This is not a case that falls within a capital offence, as Sheridan swears he lost it upon the 31st of January last; the account he gives is, he was very much in liquor, they had been drinking together, they both appeared intoxicated, he fell fast asleep, when he came into the apartment he had his watch, when he waked it was gone. This is not what the legislature meant to make a capital offence, or a stealing privately. I believe there was a decision of a similar nature; a person got intoxicated at Vauxhall, and fell asleep in one of the watch-houses or nitches upon Westminster Bridge, during which time, a waiter that came from Vauxhall stole his buckles out of his shoes, in that case the judges considered it, and they were of opinion, it was not a stealing of his property which could make it a capital offence, as he was asleep; the statute was made to protect that property which persons awake can secure; the man must have been in a situation, that he must have been upon his guard to have discovered it, in this case he could not; if you are of opinion he stole the watch it cannot be a capital offence.
