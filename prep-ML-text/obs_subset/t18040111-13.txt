I am porter to Mr. James Smith , a grocer , No. 79, Tower-street; I was sent with the chest on my knot to Craven-street, about five o'clock in the evening; I saw a waggon in Watling-street, and asked the waggoner to give me a lift; he agreed for me to do so; I went behind it past the Bolt-in-Tun, Fleet-street ; I stepped forward from the tail of the waggon to the waggoner, and asked him where about Craven-street was; I turned round, and saw the chest was gone; I stepped back, and enquired for it; I run after it, and in the third court, named Crown-court, I found two men sitting on it; I pushed his legs on one side, and put my hand on the chest, and said it was my property; I called out stop thief, and the prisoner was stopped in the court.
I went up Fisher's-alley with Wilcox, and saw the prisoner sitting on the chest, I did not hear the prisoner say any thing.
I am a porter to Mr. Abbott, in Fleet-street; I saw two men lugging a chest down a court; Wilcox came running, and enquired about it; we followed them, and found the chest and prisoner.
I live in Crown-court; I heard a lump against my door, and saw the chest and the prisoner; I took charge of the chest.
I am an officer, and took the prisoner into custody.
I am a waterman, and was plying at Blackfriars-stairs; a man came and asked me to carry a chest for him to Pepper-alley, and to help him down with it; I went, and found it too heavy; he asked me to mind it while he went for a porter; I said I would, and while I was watching, four or five men came, and being frightened, I certainly did attempt to escape.
