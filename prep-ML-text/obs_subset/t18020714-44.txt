I live at Middle Holloway : On Wednesday, the 14th of June, I had seen the ducks in a little out-house of my father's, at about eleven o'clock at night; about a quarter before one, next morning, I was alarmed by the noise they made; I looked out at the window and saw the prisoner at the bar with two ducks in his possession, in a sack, and the mouth of the sack was folded over his arm; he went about one hundred yards from the door, and returned again; I then went down to call my brother to my assistance, we went into the yard the same way that he did, and I saw him near the place again, with his sack; he dropped the sack on the premises, and ran away; I ran after him, and never lost fight of him till he was taken; he got over some pales, and my brother and I followed him, my brother laid hold of him, and we secured him; we told him he had been stealing the ducks, he said, he had not, he was looking for a place to lie down; we delivered him to the watchman, my brother picked up the ducks, and they went to their roost again.
I know nothing at all about the ducks, I was upon the high-road when they stopped me.
