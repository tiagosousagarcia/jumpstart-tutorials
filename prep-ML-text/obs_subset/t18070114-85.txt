I am the wife of Thomas Macklee, he is a rigger, I live in Shadwell.
Did you lose two silver spoons.
Yes, on the 12th of January; I saw them safe on the mantle-piece between eleven and twelve, I missed them a little after four in the afternoon; the prisoner lodged in my house, he had belonged to a man of war; there were two more men in the house, and when they were missed they said they were willing to go before a magistrate, and when Jack Conner came in, the men said here is been two spoons missing. Jack said he had not took them, he could swear by St. Paul and St. Peter; I searched for them and at last I found by Mr. Rolfe, that he had bought them. He had, owned that he had taken them before I went there.
I am a silversmith, No. 34, High street, Shadwell.
Did you buy any spoons of the prisoner at any time.
I did; on Monday the 12th of January in the afternoon, about six o'clock. I gave him six shillings for them. I am almost certain of his face, but then he has but one arm; I did not percieve it then.
I sold the gentleman no spoons; I have been eleven year's in his Majesty's service, and I was wounded in my head, and I lost an arm with lord Nelson. I cannot bring to my recollection any thing of the kind, being very much intoxicated in liquor; if done, it was not meant to defraud. It is the very first crime that ever I have been charged with.
