I am a tobacconist in Aldersgate-street , in partnership with my brother, George Haynes : On the 12th of March, Saturday night, (I had some reason to suspect the prisoner before), when the prisoner was paid his wages, I followed him out of the house, and shut the door; I had, previous to that, got a constable, he was at my hall-door; I told the prisoner I wanted to see what he had got; and in his breeches he had got two pounds and three quarters of tobacco; the prisoner had lived with me a very short time, two or three months.
What reason have you to believe it to be your's?
I believe it to be mine, but I cannot swear to it.
I am a constable. On Saturday the 12th of March, about seven o'clock, Mr. Haynes sent for me, and said, he had a suspicion of his man robbing him; I took the prisoner, and searched him, and found the tobacco in his breeches, before and behind, as much as he could stuff in.
It was not Mr. Haynes's property; I was out ten minutes after I was paid; I have a wife and three children; I have very little wages, and I bought this tobacco of a coachman, or guard, I am not sure which; I thought I could get a shilling by it, and I wanted it to get bread for my children.(The prisoner called two witnesses who gave him a good character).
