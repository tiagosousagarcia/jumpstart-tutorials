You are a haberdasher in Fleet-street .
I am.
The prisoner was in your service.
He was for about a twelve months down to the 6th day of February.
Do you remember his taking any velvet out of your house, stating that he was going to take it to a customer of your's.
I recollect it very well, there was two or three lengths he took cut, he told me that he received an order from Clift and Cockhill.
How much.
He did not say how much, he took it out of my shop, under the idea of taking it to them.
What time of the day was it when he went out of the shop.
I cannot say particularly, he generally went out between nine and ten o'clock.
Produce the entry made by himself on his return.
There is an entry there of his own writing (witness producing a book); Clift, six and a half yards of velvet, twelve shillings a yard.
That would be three pound eighteen shillings.
Yes.
That was the manner in which he accounted to you for part of the velvet he had taken out that morning.
It was.
You supposing this to be true, you sent in your account to Messrs. Clift and Cockhill.
I did.
When was it you took him up.
On the 24th of February last.
I do not know whether you made a discovery before you took him up.
After I took him up.
He lived some time with you as a servant.
He did.
He made a pretence and said that he had an order for Clift and Co. that turned out to be a false pretence.
So it appears.
In consequence of which you permitted him to take the goods.
Yes.
You gave him leave to take them away in consequence of that false pretence.
Yes.
It was his business to take out goods to customers.
Yes.
At other times he took out goods to customers, stating what he had ordered.
Yes.
Examined by Mr. Gurney. I am in partnership with Miss Clift, we carry on business in Titchfield-street.
Had you dealt with Mr. Harrison in Fleet-street.
Yes.
Has the prisoner at the bar called on you with articles of sale.
Yes.
Had he before the 6th of February, received from you any order for six yards and a half of velvet.
He had not.
Did he on that day bring you six yards and a half of velvet.
No.
When was the first notice that you received from Mr. Harrison of his supposing that you had that velvet.
About the beginning of March.
You then discovered it to be incorrect.
Yes.
You are in partnership with the last witness.
Yes, we are milleners and dress makers.
Had you given any order to the prisoner, prior to the 5th of February, for six yards and a half of velvet.
No, I never saw him after the 11th of January.
Then I need not ask you whether he brought you any velvet on the 6th of February.
He did not.
I have been in the habit of receiving orders for Mr. Harrison, whatever order I received from Miss Clift, or any other person's order, I entered down in my book; during the time I was at Mr. Thresher's, Mr. Harrison came after me, he wished to get me away, he knew I had a good connection, and during the time I was in his house he never went round to one customer, I have even given him the money in public company, he has been the person that has introduced me into company, (for singing) which has been my ruin.
