I live with Mess. Story: I am a yearly servant; Mr. Story's warehouse is in Sharp's-alley, Cow cross : on the 18th of February, I was driving the cart up Sharp's-alley about eleven o'clock; and as I was driving up the cart, the prisoner jumped up behind the cart; I had hold of the horse's head, it being up hill; he took out this piece; there was about a ton of soap in the cart; there was a man near; I halloo'd to the man to take care of the horse and cart; the prisoner went into a public-house near, and held the door on a jar; and just as I got to him, he says, here is your soap: I went and fetched an officer, and gave him charge; he stood at the corner of the door; and the man who had hold of the horse, kept his eye on him: there is about three pounds and a half, worth sixpence a pound: I do not know what the prisoner is, except by sight.
I am the officer; and took him into custody; he owned to the robbery.
I saw this cake of soap laying on the ground, and I picked it up, and looked about to see if there was any owner for it; and as soon as there was, I returned it.
