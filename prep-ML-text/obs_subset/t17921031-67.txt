I live at the house of Messrs. Neale and Turner, the prisoner lived servant with my master two months and one day; she left the service before we took her up; she was taken up a fortnight last Saturday; the 13th of October I lost a cloth apron, a muslin handkerchief, a silver thimble, and other things; I know also that my master's things were lost; there were two books lost, two pocket handkerchiefs, some linen, and a gold pin; these were the property of Mr. Turner; and two pocket-handkerchiefs, and one silk one, the property of Mr. Neal: I found the things in her lodging, in a place called Cat's Hall, near St. Catherine's Square. When I went to her lodgings she was at home, and she gave me leave to look at her box, and there was nothing in it but her own; I looked round that room, and then went up in the garret; I found the things in a bundle, and a gold pin, which I did not take, because I did not know of the loss the prisoner begged I would not hurt her, I told her I would not; she is a young girl not eighteen.
I know nothing more than what the first witness has represented: I went a second time to the prisoner's lodgings, and found the gold pin.
