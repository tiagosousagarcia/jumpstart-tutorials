I am a currier and leather-cutter, No. 10, Clerkenwell-close: I was in Tart's house about three weeks or a month ago; the prisoner came in for a pint of porter; Mrs. Tart went down to draw the beer, and he put a pint pot in his pocket; I laid hold of him, and told him, he had got something that did not belong to him; he said, he had, and desired me to let him go; I took it from him; Mrs. Tart came up, and she wished him to be detained; Longden, the officer, was sent for.
He did his business in a clumsy manner, as if he had not been used to it?
Yes.
