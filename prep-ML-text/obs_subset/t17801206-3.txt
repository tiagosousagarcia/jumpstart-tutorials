I lost a silver box and a variety of copper and silver coins, from a drawer in my house in Downing-street, Westminster . The prisoner was my servant . I had about a month ago a message from the office in Bow-street, that a person had offered to sell some silver coins, which he said he had taken from me. I went the next day and saw the boy (the prisoner) there, and the box and some of the coins, which he said he had taken from me.
I keep a hardware shop in the Strand. About seven months ago the prisoner came to me and said, I have some pocket pieces to sell. I said, let me see them, are you sure they are your own property? He said yes, my grandmother left them to me, I have a sore eye, and so may as well sell them. I bought two ounces of him; I gave him twelve shillings. After that I had a hand-bill given me, that Lord Aylesbury had lost two thousand pound's worth. I went to Lord Aylesbury's and showed them to his Lordship; he said he believed they were some he had lost, and desired me if the person came again, to stop him. On the 1st of September the prisoner came to me again and brought these twenty-three pocket pieces. I said they are very curious pocket pieces, are you sure they are your own property? He said yes; I said, I was afraid he had stolen them, as I had received a hand-bill that a great lord had lost two thousand pounds worth, and I must take him into custody. I took him to Bow-street, and searched him, and found this silver box, and seven more pocket-pieces in his pocket. They have been in my possession ever since. (The silver box was produced in court.)
This is my box, but I cannot swear to the pocket-pieces. I had some of the same kind.
The justice said I must go to Lord Aylesbury. I went; his Lordship was in Ireland. The prisoner was put into the round-house. The next day he voluntarily confessed he lived with Mr. Cocks, the banker, at Charing-cross, and that he had taken them from him.
