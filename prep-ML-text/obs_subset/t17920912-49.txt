I sent my boy on Friday, the 27th of of July, with some shoes; they were taken from him; he is an errand boy; he had three dozen and six pair of shoes.
On Friday, the 27th of July, I was sent out with forty-two pair of shoes; they were in a bag; I was to take them to Duke's-court, St. Martin's-lane; my master lives in Colman street; I carried them as far as Middle Temple-lane; there I rested; I asked the prisoner to help them upon my back; he said, yes, my lad, how far are you going? I told him to Duke's court; he said he was going as far as the Haymarket, and he would carry them for me; he took them on his shoulder; he went into the Boar's-head, in Exeter-street ; and told me to go in and order him a pint of beer, he went into the public house, and drank his beer; he gave me a bad shilling and a tobacco pouch, and sent me to get some tobacco; when I returned, he was gone with the shoes; I ran down Burleigh-street, and cried stop thief! and at the corner of Exeter-court, he dropped them; he was about two steps down the Savoy-steps, one Thompson saw him drop them; I am sure I did not ask the prisoner to carry them; where I found the shoes was about the length of the court from the public-house.
I am servant to Mr. Williams, at the Boar's-head, in Exeter-street; the prisoner came to the door of our house, with the boy, and while the boy was gone, the prisoner took the bag up on his shoulders, and ran down the street as hard as he could run; I called out stop thief! I ran after him, and saw him drop the bag at the corner of Change-court, I did not see the prisoner taken.
I pursued the prisoner; and he dropped the bag; I stood by it, till he was brought back; the boy came up to me, and said, this is my bag.
I stopped the prisoner; I saw the prisoner run.
I can ascertain the shoes to be mine; I have no doubt at all.
I have a very large family, and was not three doors from the public house; I had no intention of stealing the shoes.
