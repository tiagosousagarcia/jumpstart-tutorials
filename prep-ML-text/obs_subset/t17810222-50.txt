I am apprentice to Mr. Davison. I made the rope which was stolen, and know it to be my master's property. It is made of an inferior yarn to raft timber.
Do other rope-makers make rope of the same kind?
Nobody but us.
The prisoner came into my master's warehouse and begged the favour of me to help him up with the rope. He said my master had weighed it or seen it weighed; that it was bought and he was going to carry it to Lime-house. I helped him up with it in the warehouse, and he took it away. I asked him where the foreman was? He said he was busy. He went out at the back-door. I asked him why he did not go out at the fore-door? He said the back-door would do as well.
Was that rope bought of you by any person, or did you weigh it for any body?
No, I was at home ill.
I saw the prisoner with the coil of rope. When he put it off his shoulder, I enquired of him who it belonged to? and finding him in different stories, I secured him.
Who is your master?
Mr. Corbet. He said my master had sold it. I understood him Mr. Corbet.
I was so much in liquor I did not know what I did.
