Be so good as state the particulars of this transaction, and who were your partners?
On the 21st of November, our firm was Frances, Joseph, and Jonathan Sills; the prisoner was our clerk, and employed in receiving money on our account, which he settled every day. I have his book, and, on the 21st of November, 1801, there are four articles entered, but not the sum of one pound eleven shillings received of Mr. Willett.
Has that sum ever been accounted for?
Never.
That article is entirely omitted?
Yes.
I live in Aldersgate-street: On the 21st of November, application was made to me, on the part of Messrs. Sills, for the payment of one pound eleven shillings and seven-pence. I paid one pound eleven shillings, and the person to whom I paid it gave me a receipt, (produces it;) but I cannot say whether it was the prisoner.
I am clerk to Messrs. Sills, and know the prisoner's hand-writing. This is his writing, (looking at the receipt.)
I leave my defence to my Counsel.
