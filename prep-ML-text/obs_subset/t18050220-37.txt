I am brother-in-law to Mr. John-Floyd Hopkins , he keeps an oil-shop in Fitzroy-street : On the 12th of January, Ann Morgan and another was in the shop; she asked for a quartern of yellow soap, and tendered me a shilling; I scrupled the shilling; she said I might cut it, or do what I liked with it; I went to take a pair of scissars to cut the shilling; I saw her go to the soap, and take a cake of it; I looked very hard at her, and the other person said to her, the gentleman thinks you are stealing something, why do not you come forward; when she came forward, I jumped over the counter, and called the watchman, and gave charge of her; the wedge of soap was laying on the counter; after she had taken it I saw it under her arm; she tried to put her cloak over it.
I am watch-house keeper: On the 12th of January the prisoner was brought to me, and this soap; while she was in the watch-house, she dropped a separate piece from under her cloak, Mr. Edwards had these in his custody.
What is the worth of this soap?
There are four pounds of it, it is worth three shillings and fourpence.
Did I not buy half a quartern of soap; it was another woman that took it and you let her go?
You did not buy the soap, I did not like the shilling.
At eleven o'clock, when my partner was going his round, I was sitting in the box; Mr. Edwards called, and I went over and took the prisoner in charge; when she was at the watch-house there was a piece of soap dropped from under her clothes.
Was that soap on the counter?
Yes, there were 140 lb. on the counter, going out on Monday; I noticed this piece of soap, there was no more like it.
I bought half a quartern of soap, and I paid for it; I never stole the man's soap.
