I am a servant : On the 20th of January, I lost my gown from the Green Man at Paddington ; the duplicate of it was found on the prisoner, who was porter there; the gown was in my box on the landing-place.
I searched the prisoner, and found the duplicate; he confessed he had opened the box, and taken the gown out, that he was very sorry, and would take me to the place where it was, which he did, and that he did it through distress.
I am a pawnbroker, and produce the gown which I had from the prisoner on the 10th of January. (The gown produced and identified.)
I met a Jew who was disposing of some cloaths, and I gave him ten shillings for the gown; when I went home, I had no supper to eat, and having no money, I pawned it for seven shillings and sixpence.
