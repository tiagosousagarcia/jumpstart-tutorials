I am a labouring-man ; I keep house in the parish of Hayes ; my house was broke open in the morning; my wife was last out of, and first into the house.
My house was broke open about a month back. In the morning I went out after my husband, and fastened the door; I locked it: the house was secure; I came out about seven in the morning, and returned about seven in the evening: a board was taken down from the back-part of the house, a place that any person might get through; I found the back-door open; I missed a silk cloak, a muslin apron, a lawn apron (repeats the articles in the indictment) I suspected Jane Rolfe ; she was at my house in the morning, and wanted a lodging. My husband found the things upon her; I should know them again.
I do not recollect the day of the month the robbery was done; it was on Tuesday; on Thursday I found her at Brentford; the cloak was on her arm, and the other things in a bundle; I have kept the things ever since.
It was light when we went out, and when we returned. The handkerchief is marked S; the coloured apron was marked; these two books belong to us; she made away with one of them; before the justice she said she picked the mark out of the cheque apron.
