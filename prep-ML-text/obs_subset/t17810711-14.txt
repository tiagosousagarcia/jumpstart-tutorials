I keep the Queen's Head, Whitechapel Road . On the Friday in Whitsun week we erected a bit of a booth before the door, for people to sit in as they went to and from the fair. I was informed there was a ladder set up against my house in the lane: I went to see, and saw the prisoner just putting his legs out of our one-pair-of-stairs window, coming out; it was between ten and eleven at night, it might be a quarter after ten: I cried, Stop thief! By that time he was on the ladder. I turned the ladder round, and threw him flat on the ground: when he was down, I fell upon him with all my strength: we had a struggle; he tore my shirt almost all to pieces. Another man came to his assistance; he was released from me, and run down Ducking-pond lane, to the brick fields. I followed him as fast as I could, till I overtook him and secured him: he was searched; he had nothing upon him but these keys. (producing them.)
Did you lose any thing?
I lost nothing. I shut down the window about five or six o'clock; I do not remember whether it had been opened afterwards or no.
I went to Mr. Cole, and told him there was a ladder raised at his window: he directly turned round the corner, and I saw no more.
I am a weaver. I left off work at ten at night. I was coming home; I saw a mob, and ran to see what was the matter.
