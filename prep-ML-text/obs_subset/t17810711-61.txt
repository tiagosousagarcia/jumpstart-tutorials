I am a pawnbroker , in Old Gravel-lane . Upon the 13th of June, the prisoner and another woman came to redeem a stove. I was not in the shop when she came in. My wife called me down, and said she had lost a cloak. I went out, and saw the prisoner at the door, sitting on the step, seemingly very much in liquor. I told her to get up, and not sit there, to hinder my customers coming in. I assisted her to get up. When she got up, I observed her hand was under her apron. I took up her apron, and saw my cloak in her hand. I took it from her.
I was in the shop. I went to fetch something out of pledge. I saw the cloak hanging up when I went in. When Mrs. Matthews had given me change, she missed the cloak, and said somebody had stole the cloak. It was gone from the place where I saw it hang up. I afterwards saw the prosecutor take it from the prisoner, at the door.
I was so drunk, I do not know how I came by the cloak.
