I lost a pewter quart pot on the 22d of March. I can only speak to the property.
I keep a publick-house in Robinhood-court . On the 22d of March, about five o'clock, the prisoner was going by my house. My wife said she suspected she was going to steal some of our pots. I saw her go into a house opposite where there was a pot standing in the passage. She came out, I laid hold of her and said, she had something which was not her own. She said she had not. I opened her cloak and found this quart pot; and in her apron I found another quart pot and a pint pot. I sent for Mr. Mayor, his name was upon this pot.
Going by I saw the pot stand, and was going to carry it home.
