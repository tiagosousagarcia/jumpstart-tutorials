I am an apprentice on board the ship. I lost these things out of my chest last Thursday.
I am a Thames police officer. On Thursday night about six o'clock, I let the prisoner out of the dock gates; he had a blue jacket, a pair of trowsers, and shirt tied up over his shoulder, with a bundle of sticks over them; he told me that he got them from a boy to carry to a slop merchant to get them changed, they did not fit him; I asked him to shew me the ship, that I might be convinced of it; he would not tell me the ship's name. I took him before the magistrate, and the boy came and owned the things.
We had a good many people working on board; I was going home with a bundle of sticks, I saw a bundle tied up, I took it up and looked at them, I said I will take these things home, and when I come tomorrow I will let them know; I took them, and when I came off with the things I met the constable.
