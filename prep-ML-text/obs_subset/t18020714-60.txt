I am a carpenter, I live opposite Mr. Clancey's; I saw the prisoner on the 10th of June, take twelve china plates, and put them under her cloak; she took them from a sideboard, close to the window; when she was gone a few yards from the place, I went and took her, and delivered her up to Mr. Clancey's wife.
