My father is a baker , at No. 62, Berner's-street: On the 4th of February, about twelve o'clock, I put my basket down at the corner of Wells-street , while I went to serve a customer, and on my return I saw the prisoner go down a passage with it on his back; I ran after him, and asked him what business he had with it; he told me it was not mine; I said, there was WS on it; then he put it down, and took two loaves out of it, which he said were his; I then collared him, and said he should go with me to my father; I asked a woman to mind the basket; he ran away, but I caught him in Windmill-street; he begged for mercy, and said he would never do the like again; then he got from me again, but I caught him at the top of Blenheim steps, and he gave me a push down them; a young man then stopped him, and he was taken into custody; we found out afterwards that the two loaves did not belong to my father, but that he had taken them out of another basket.
I am a poor man, and was out of work; I took the bread on purpose to carry home to my wife and four small children.
