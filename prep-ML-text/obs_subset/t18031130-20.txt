I am a carpenter : On the 27th of October, I lost the things mentioned in the indictment; I live in Windmill-street, Bethnal-green ; the prisoner had lodged with me a week, he is a seafaring lad ; he got up about seven o'clock; he went into the kitchen, and took the things; he then went out; I missed them in about a quarter of an hour; I went after him, and overtook him in Whitechapel, with the things upon him; I took him before a Magistrate, and he was committed. (Produces and identifies the property.)
I am a constable and beadle; I took these things out of the prisoner's hand.
I have nothing to say.
