I live at No. 8, Lukener's-lane. I let her every thing that was necessary, bed, bedstead, table, chairs, and every thing that is necessary, bed, blankets, and sheets, a pair of linen sheets; she stayed one week in the lodging, she came June 4th, that day week she set off, and these linen sheets was missing.
Did she pay you for your lodging?
No. There were two sheets lost; one was offered to sell by a man, to Mr. Bristol, who charged the watch with him.
Mr. Bristol called for the watch, and I went, and I found a man had a sheet, and when I came up he knocked me down, and I took up the sheet, and have kept it ever since.
