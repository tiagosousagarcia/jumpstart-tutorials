On the 18th of March, about ten o'clock in the evening, my brother and me were turning the corner of Great Newport-street , and the prisoner came behind my brother and just snatched my watch out of my pocket; a silver watch and key, and two seals, as mentioned in the indictment: I have no doubt of the prisoner: he gave the watch to another man; I saw him; the man stood in the kennel; but I took the prisoner.
My brother-in-law and me were walking along and the prisoner came round me and snatched the watch from him.
I was coming from Soho-square, from Knox's; one of these gentlemen ran against me; he seemed in liquor; he said he had lost his watch, and took hold of me and took me to St. Martin's watch-house; I was searched, and nothing was found upon me.
Were you, either of you, in liquor?
I was not, nor my brother.
I hope I shall be permitted to go for an East India Soldier.
