On the 9th of May, at about noon, in consequence of the information of a neighbour, I followed the prisoner into Grub-street, and found two quart pots of mine under her cloak. In searching her lodgings, I found another quart pot and a pint pot of mine. She had resorted to our house for liquor ten or twelve days; in the course of that time, I lost above 20 pots.
I saw the prisoner take a pot off Mr. Dolly's horse; I told Mr. Dolly of it: he followed her, and took two pots from under her arm.
I helped a child up that had fell down; I saw two quart pots; I took them up, and was carrying them to Mr. Dolly's, when he laid hold of me.
