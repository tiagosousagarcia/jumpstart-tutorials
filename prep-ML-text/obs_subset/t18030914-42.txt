I am the wife of Job Waldon, he is a tailor , and keeps a house, No. 52, Bolsover-street, Cavendish-square : On Wednesday, the 7th of this month, I lost a pewter bason I saw the prisoner come up stairs, and go into the street; I followed him, and asked him what business he had in my house, and he said he wanted a tailor; I went back, and missed a pewter bason out of the cellar; I went after him again, and found it upon him; the witness here brought him back with the bason, and two pieces of leaden pipe that he had taken from the same place; I am sure it was my bason, I had had it eleven years; it was very dirty; it had been in the cellar about three quarters of a year; the prisoner seemed rather in liquor, but he walked very well; he said he would make me any allowance if I would let him off.
I assisted in stopping the prisoner; he had a pewter bason, and some leaden pipe.
