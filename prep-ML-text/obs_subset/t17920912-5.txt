I am a gunsmith ; I live at Mr. Hemmings's; on the 11th of July I lost the things in the indictment from the garret where I slept, I last saw them the Sunday before; the prisoner laid in the same bed; I was at the White-horse public-house, I was fetched home, and when I came up stairs, at half past nine, the prisoner shoved open the door, and rushed by me, and the candle went out; I could see it was the prisoner, he was stopped on the one pair of stairs, and my coat was on his back, under his own old coat; the other things were all upon him; three shirts of mine and his own, and my coat and waistcoat, and breeches, under his own.
How many persons lodged in the house?
Myself and the prisoner at the bar, and Mrs. Williams, and her husband, and Hemmings lived in the house himself, he had lived in the house about six weeks; I know nothing of his family.
I am an officer; the prisoner was brought to the watch-house; he had his coat and waistcoat, and three shirts, and his breeches, and two pair of stockings, and three pair of stockings he had in his pocket.
The coat cost me 40 s. they will come to that good, though there are several old things among them.
