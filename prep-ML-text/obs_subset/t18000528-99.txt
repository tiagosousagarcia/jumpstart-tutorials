I am the wife of Frederick Wilson , boot-maker and closer , No. 1, Berwick-street : On the 30th of April, a little after nine in the evening, we heard a noise in the passage; and my husband went out in pursuit of the prisoner; I afterwards saw him at the watch-house, and swore to the property.
On the 30th of April I heard a noise in the passage; I saw the prisoner run swiftly out of the passage across the way; I pursued him and called, stop thief; he then dropped a flannel petticoat; I picked it up, and pursued him; when he had got a little further, he dropped a muslin apron; I picked up the apron, and the prisoner was stopped; we took him to the watch-house.
I am innocent of the crime laid to my charge.
