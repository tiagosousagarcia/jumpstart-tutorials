I am apprentice to Mr. Plummer, a West-India merchant , who lives at No. 48 in Lime-street . Yesterday morning about half after eleven o'clock a lad came to me in the compting-house and asked me if I missed a hamper; I told him I did not.
Had you any care of these bottles?
No. He told me a man had been taken up with a hamper on his back that was supposed to be taken out of our hall and was in a stable yard behind the house. I went to the place and saw the prisoner with a number of people about him who had stopped him; the hamper had been taken from him; it contained twenty four empty bottles. I knew the hamper to belong to us by a parchment direction on it to John Beach, Esq. Hackney, who is one of the partners of the house. I went to Mr. Plummer, and one of the clerks went with the prisoner to the compting-house while I went to Mr. Plummer who was out.
I stopped the prisoner with the hamper in the stable yard behind Mr. Plummer's house. I had seen him and others lurking about the place for two or three weeks; I had a suspicion of him and stopped him. The hamper had a direction to Mr. Beach and contained twenty four empty bottles.
The hamper had been in my hall about a fortnight; it had two dozen of empty bottles in it; it was directed to John Beach, Esq. Hackney. I had observed the direction several times, it was my hamper.
A man asked me if I would earn a shilling and gave me this hamper to carry to Leaden-hall street. I had not gone far before this man stopped me.
