I am the wife of William Ellis , I keep a cellar on Saffron-hill ; I missed a waistcoat off a hook that I hang my things out upon; I pursued the prisoner and he was stopped, and brought back; (produces the waistcoat)
I am a watchman. On Thursday evening, about five o'clock, coming up Saffron - hill, I saw the prisoner take the waistcoat; I stopped him, and brought him back; the prosecutrix took the waistcoat from him.
I saw the prosecutrix run and take the waistcoat from under the prisoner's coat.
It has my mark upon it.
I was coming down Saffron-hill very much in liquor, this woman came after me, and said I had got a waistcoat of her's; I don't know whether I had or not, I was very much in liquor.
