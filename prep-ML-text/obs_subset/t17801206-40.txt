I am in partnership with John Child . I lived at the White Bear warehouse, in Piccadilly. On the 25th of November I lost a cask of Yorkshire ale, twenty-six gallons; it was deposited at a Mr. Clark's, in James-street, who not having convenience desired me to send for it. I ordered my man to fetch the ale from Mr. Clark's; he went and brought up the cask of ale from thence. He was sent to deliver it to Mr. Withers, at the George, in the Hay-market . He went and returned in about ten minutes, and said the cask of ale was stolen out of the cart. I directed him to patrole on one side of the Hay-market, I was on the other; to try to discover the cask. At the end of James-street, I saw some people collected together near an hackney-coach; there I saw this cask of ale, and the people attempting to lift it up into the coach; one end of it was upon the boot. I asked what they were going to do with that ale? The coachman pointed to the prisoner and said, \"that was the gentleman who employed him.\" I asked the prisoner what he meant to do with the ale? He wheeled round the back of the coach, and ran away. I pursued him, and cried stop thief! I never lost fight of him till he was apprehended. He fell down in Oxendon-street, there he was taken.
I am a publican in Oxendon-street. I came out upon the cry of stop thief! I saw the prisoner running; he fell down, and I seised him.
I was going through the Hay-market; I met two young fellows; they asked me to assist them with a cask into the coach.
