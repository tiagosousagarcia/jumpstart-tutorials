On Monday, the 2d of December last, I sent my mare, by a servant, to Thomas Woodman , a farmer, to be taken into his straw-yard, at Hayes ; on Thursday, the 5th, I learned that the mare had been sent to Aldridge's Repository; in consequence of which I found her there; she was a bay mare, about fifteen hands high; she had had a disorder, which occasioned the hair to be off in different parts of her body; she was about ten or eleven years old; I saw the mare, and knew her to be mine.
I am servant to Mr. Sewell: On the 2d of December, I took a mare of my master's to Thomas Woodman 's, at Hayes; I delivered her to Mr. Woodman myself, and he gave me a receipt of her delivery; on the Friday afterwards I saw her at Mr. Aldridge's; she had some marks, being rubbed on the near side of the shoulder, and the off side of the tail; she had a piece of a tooth knocked out on the near side of her mouth, and in the fore foot behind there was a flaw.
Was this a mare for the saddle?
Yes.
You do not know how the mare got out of the straw-yard?
No.
I live at Mr. Aldridge's: On Wednesday morning, the 4th of December, the prisoner brought a mare for sale; it was a bay mare, about fifteen hands high, she had a number of marks about her; I saw the advertisement in the paper, and I sent for the mare back from the person that had purchased her, and it corresponded in every particular; there was a crack in the off foot behind, and many places where the hair had been rubbed off her hind quarter, and likewise her tail, and underneath her mane; Pepper came, and identified the mare; I opened the stable-door, and let him pick the mare out; there were others in the stable at the same time; afterwards Mr. Sewell came, and he identified her; she was the same mare that the prisoner brought to me.
I apprehended the prisoner at Mr. Aldridge's, when he came to receive the money for the mare.
The mare that I saw at Aldridge's was the mare that I took to Mr. Woodman's.
