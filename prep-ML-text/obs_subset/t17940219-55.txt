an enquiry, and they said, it was a false note.
Did you demand the money on it?
Yes.
Was you paid?
I was not.
I am a clerk to Taylor and Co.
Have you any partner?
With what part of the kingdom do you principally correspond?
Many parts, but not at Plymouth, where that bill is asssigned from.
Have you made any enquiry at Plymouth?
I had not parted with the goods, and I enquired at the Bankers, and they did not know such people.
