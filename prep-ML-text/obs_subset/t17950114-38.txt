I am the constable that took the woman into custody with this property; a servant maid belonging to Mrs. Brown, came to me and told me that she suspected a woman had stole a tea kettle, on the 16th of December, I was going up New Gravel-lane, Shadwell, to apprehend the woman with the servant maid, and I found the prisoner at the bar with the kettle in this basket.
How far is Gravel-lane from John Brown's?
About a quarter of a mile. She told me it was her own property, and I took her to the prosecutor, and had her to the magistrate, and she was bound over, and I have been and told her the consequence, and she will not attend.
