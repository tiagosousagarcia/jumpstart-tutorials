I am gunner of his Majesty's ship, Dictator , I live on board, the prisoner was my servant ; the Dictator, at that time, lay in the River Medway, near Chatham; the prisoner had been my servant six years ago, but this time he came to me in great distress, about a week before this happened; he went away on the 3d of October, and I saw no more of him till the 12th, when he was taken by one of the officers.
The prisoner came to lodge with me on the 4th of October, at No. 4, Nag's-head-court, Drury-lane; he was dressed very genteel; his hair was dressed and powdered, and a silk umbrella in his hand; he said he was going to Somerset-house to receive some prize-money; he asked me to go and pawn a coat for him, which I did; he went to the shop with me; a day or two after he went away, and brought a spying-glass, which I pawned at the same place; I did not pawn any thing else for him.
I am a pawnbroker, No. 318, in the Strand; the articles have been all delivered up; they were pledged by Mary Kelly; the prisoner was with her at the time the coat was pawned; I paid the money to the women; I lent 14s. on the coat, on the 4th of Octo ber, and 12s. on the telescope on the 6th of October, and on the 7th of October the prisoner came, and had 3s. more on the same telescope; on the 8th of October I delivered them to Mr. Solomons; he fetched them out, and paid principal and interest for them.
I redeemed these things; I live facing the Play-house, in Wooburn-street; Mary Kelly and the prisoner left the duplicates; I redeemed the coat and the telescope, and I gave 32s. for them (produces them) I had the duplicates from the prisoner; on the 12th of October the officer and the prosecutor came to me, and I shewed them the property; the coat was all over powder and dirt, and I had it scowered.
I was never guilty of the like before, but I got a little liquor.
