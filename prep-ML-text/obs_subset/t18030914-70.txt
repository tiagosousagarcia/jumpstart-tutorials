- I am a chair-maker , and keep a house No. 12, Worship-street : I left the money in my pocket when I went out to dinner, and did not miss it till Tuesday, when my lodger asked me if I had left fourteen-pence in my pocket; I cannot swear to the money; the prisoner is an articled apprentice to me. I cannot say I lost any.
I lodge with Mr. Goldsmith: There was a difference between the apprentices about the money in their master's small clothes; the prisoner said there was a shilling and two-pence, and would have the other to have part of it; I did not hear any more.
I am an apprentice to Mr. Goldsmith: On Sunday the 7th of August, the prisoner came in after my master was gone out, and he took fourteen-pence out of my master's breeches pocket, which were laying on the ground, and asked me whether I would have part of it. I cannot say what he did with it, I refused it.
