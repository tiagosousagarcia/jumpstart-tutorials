It was in December, was it?
I cannot say.
How long before Christmas?
It was since Christmas.
Have pou no idea of time?
As near as I can tell it was two months ago.
Do you know when Christmas was?
In December.
The young woman I keep company with brought it to me, and told me to go and pawn it, and if I was stopped, to tell them I got it at a raffle.
