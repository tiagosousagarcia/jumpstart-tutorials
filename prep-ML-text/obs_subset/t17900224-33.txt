I keep a haberdasher's shop , in Oxford-street . On Friday, the 29th of January, the prisoner came into the shop and asked for two yards of worsted binding; the boy served him.
Do you know the nature of an oath?
Yes, if I tell a lie I shall go to the Devil.
The prisoner came in for two yards of worsted binding; I asked him what it was for? I think he said, to bind a black petticoat; he would not let me wrap it up in paper; but slung it round his arm; on going out he opened a glass case; I went to shut it; and I went to the door, and saw two other boys at the door, a chimney sweeper and another; in about ten minutes he came back, and slid the glass case back, and very suddenly snatched a quantity of handkerchiefs; I jumped over the counter, and caught hold of his pocket, and tore it; some body pulled the door too, and pinched my thumb, that I could not hold him; he ran round a coach, and my master called stop thief: he was taken in Woodstock-street; I never lost sight of him till he got into a publick-house: he dropped the handkerchiefs as he ran round the coach, by the wheel; I saw them drop from his right side; I saw him go into the publick-house; he had a blue coat and black waistcoat on.
On the 29th of January I heard the cry of stop thief, at the door of Mr. Grant's; I saw the prisoner run round the hind part of a coach; and I saw the handkerchiefs drop from his right side; he ran round to the horses heads, and I pursued him; I never lost sight of him till he got into the publick-house passage: Mr. Grant picked up the handkerchiefs.
I am a constable. I was sent for to Mr. Grant's, to take the prisoner into custody, and the handkerchiefs.
Now tell me what you did in this business?
I immediately ran across the street, and cried stop thief: I saw the prisoner drop the handkerchiefs by the coach; I picked them up, and saw somebody had him, for they said, here he is: Mr. Buckle was with him when taken.
There are twenty of them altogether: my mark is U. R.
