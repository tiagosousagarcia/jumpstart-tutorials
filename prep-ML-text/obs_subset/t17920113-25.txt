I live in Gower's-walk, No. 3, Whitechapel ; I am a lodger; I lost my apparel on the 16th of December; I missed them at eleven o'clock, from my chamber; it was two pair of stairs; I mentioned it next morning to the landlord of the house, Mr. Cooke, that I lost these things; the prisoner works in the house, a taylor .
I was the next-door neighbour partly; Mrs. Staker desired me to go with her, and take the prisoner, at his master's house; afterwards he owned where the property was; it was moved as far as Gun-street, Spitalfields; the prisoner at the bar went with me to the house, and in a back room up one pair of stairs he gave me the property off the tester of the bed; he first of all took down two towels, and then the rest of the things tied up in a towel.
Mrs. Staker lodges in my house, and the prisoner worked in my house.
I had the things delivered into my care at the justice's, and have kept them ever since.
I was going into the yard, and saw these things on the tiles, and there was a man, jumped over the tiles; I picked them up, and I thought I would play the rogue with with them: when they were asked for, I delivered up the things safe.
He has worked for me a year and nine months; he is about nineteen; he never wronged me of any thing, to the best of my knowledge.
