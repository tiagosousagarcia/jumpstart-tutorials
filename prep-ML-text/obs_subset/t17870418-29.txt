On Saturday night last I had been to market, and returning, I saw two or three women of the town; and my husband was leaning against a post, and the prisoner came and struck me, about twelve at night, and tore my bonnet off my head, and struck me a second time, and tore my cloak from off my shoulders.
On Saturday night last, at twelve o'clock, I heard a noise; I went out towards where the noise was, and the prosecutrix gave me charge of a woman; not the prisoner, but another woman; the croud was so great, and not having any assistance, I could not tell what to do.
Hearing the rattle spring, I ran to Macdonald's assistance; I saw the bonnet drop between the prisoner and Mrs. Inglish; the prosecutrix gave charge of the prisoner for taking her cloak and bonnet; I did not see the prisoner drop the bonnet or cloak; they had come 200 yards from the place where the affray happened; I know no more.
What charge did the prosecutrix give?
For robbing her, and beating her.
I heard the rattle spring in Long Lane; I went to the assistance of the party, and asked what was the matter, and I saw the prosecutrix all over blood, and the prisoner was charged for robbing John Inglish of a handkerchief.
I was going up Long Lane, and there was a mob; the prosecutrix was very much in liquor, and tore every body she came near, and said she had lost her cloak, and she would take me up for it.
