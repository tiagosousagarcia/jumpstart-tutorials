I am Sir George's house-keeper; I delivered the linen to Harry Hobson to carry to Sabella Moor to wash; they were the things mentioned in the indictment.
I received some linen from Judith Stone to carry to Sabella Moore , it was in a parcel, but here is the bill; going down Lower Brook-street, and opposite to No. 53, I was tapped on the shoulder by a genteel well-dressed man, who told me I was wanted, and turning to see who it was, a person stepped from the step of a door, and looked me full in the face, I thought it was somebody that knew me, but I found it was a stranger, he begged me to be so obliging as to fetch him a coach as I was going that way, he said he would give me sixpence, he never offered me any, as I was going away with the linen he came after me, and begged over and over again that he might have the linen to take into the house till I returned, as he was in a great hurry to take two ladies up that were to be set down in Henrietta-street, he took the linen off my head with a pretence to take it into the house, and I ran round the corner to call a coach, and returned in a few minutes, and I found he was gone.
Did you see him take the linen into the house.
No, he took them up to the door, I took him about five the same afternoon at the corner of Broad-street, Oxford-road; I never found the linen again; I am sure the prisoner is the person.
I never saw the man till the minute he stopped me in Oxford-road.
The linen never was brought to me.
