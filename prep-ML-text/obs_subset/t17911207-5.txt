I am a porter, and agent for merchants ; we are responsible for every article taken out of the cart, till it goes on board; I am alone responsible: this cheese was taken from the custom-house keys the 2d of December, about eleven. I missed it; I did not see it taken; I had notice of it in about five minutes; I went to the place, and missed one of the cheeses. The prisoner was brought back with the cheese. I cannot positively swear to the cheese; but it was the same sort of cheese. It was under the second crane, next to the wool-key.
I saw the man take the cheese out of the basket, under the the second crane, next Wool-key. I had not time to stop him. I can swear the prisoner is the man that took the cheese. I saw him when he was brought back; he was the same man; I have no doubt about him; he had a jacket on.
I was just come off the keys. I met the prisoner with something, which I supposed to be a cheese; I stopped him, and found a cheese in his apron. He said, he found it. I made enquiry, and took the prisoner to the keys, and found Mr. Smith had lost one. I did not examine the other cheeses; they have no marks; it was all that kind of cheese, as far as I know. There were 114 baskets, and one was missing from one basket, and this corresponded.
