I am a Portuguese sailor , and lost the things stated in the indictment.
I am the landlord of a public-house, the prisoner and prosecutor slept together in my house; in the morning, the prisoner said,\"let me out, let me out,\" I thought there was something wrong, and watched him out; I immediately run up stairs to the prosecutor, and asked him if he had lost any thing, he said he had lost his cloaths; I run after the prisoner, and brought him back with the things on his back, under his own, he had two suits on.
I had two shillings in my waistcoat, which was gone, and I only took the cloaths up to see if I could find it, when the landlord asked me what I was doing with them, I said, looking for my money.
I stopped him in Queen-street, Towerhill, with them on.
