I am a poulterer : I live in Bishopsgate-street, and have a shop in Leadenhall market .
I am an apprentice to Thomas Morris : On Friday, the 25th of January, I was standing in my master's shop, about a quarter past five in the evening; the prisoner at the bar came up to the shop; I had lit up one candle and went to get another, and the prisoner not seeing any body in the shop he took up a goose and put it under his jacket; with that I went after him, and when he saw me coming after him, he took to his heels and ran; I called out, stop thief; then he pulled out the goose from under his jacket and threw it from him; I am positive of the man, he was never out of my sight.
How far was he from the shop to where he was stopped by any body?
About twenty yards.
You did not see him throw it away?
A young man picked it up, and gave it to the officer.
