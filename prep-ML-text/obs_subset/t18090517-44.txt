I am butler to Mrs. Battina Chaplain, the prisoner was a coachman ; in consequence of his neglecting his duty on the 3rd of May, Mrs. Chaplain desired he might be discharged; I took his suit of clothes from him; I found a box coat and a great coat wanting; the prisoner said the coats were in the stables; I went with him to the stables, the coats were not there; and coming out of the yard, he said he had sold the coats to a hackney coachman.
The coats in question were lost unknown to me, I was so intoxicated, I cannot account how they were gone; the butler told me if I would give four pound Mrs. Chaplain would proceed no further in it.
I work in Mr. Gullen's yard. I saw the prisoner on the 3d of May, between eleven and twelve o'clock take the coats out of the yard; he said he was going to deliver them up to Mrs. Chaplin, and he would be d - d if ever he drove her any more.
