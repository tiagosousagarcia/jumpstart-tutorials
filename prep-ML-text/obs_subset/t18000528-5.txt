I am a cabinetmaker , in Old Compton-street ; I was not at home at the time the tea-chest was lost, I can only prove the property.
I am the wife of William Rann ; I was sitting in the parlour, facing the shop; I did not see any body come in, but I saw the tail of a dark coloured coat, going out of the shop; I went into the shop and missed the tea-chest from behind the door; I did not hear any body come in; he left the door open; I gave an alarm, and the prisoner was brought back with the tea-chest under his arm; I know it to be my tea-chest.
I am servant to the last witness; my mistress gave an alarm that the tea
chest was gone; I followed the prisoner down Compton street, to the corner of Dean-street, and called stop thief, and he was brought back to my master's house with the tea-chest under his arm; he was never out of my sight at all.
Was I not standing still when you first saw me?
He was standing at the door of a house of call, thinking to get in at the door; but he could not, and then he ran off.
I am a butcher, I heard the cry of stop thief; I went up to the prisoner, and asked him, where did you steal this tea-chest from, is it your's or is it not; he said, it was his property; Agnes Stour said, it was her master's property; I immediately took him by the collar, and took him back to the shop; I delivered the property to Agnes Stout , and the prisoner to the constable.
I received this property from Mrs. Rann,
I picked up the tea-chest at the step of a door in Dean-street; I did not know whose property it was.
