I am a bricklayer , and live at No. 32, St. James's-street, St. George's in the East: On Tuesday morning last, being Thanksgiving-day, I came from home about ten o'clock, to go to Temple-bar, and returned about two; when I got back, I put my hand in my pocket and missed my book; on Thursday one of the officers brought it to me.
I am a City officer: on Tuesday, about a quarter before two, I and Cartwright apprehended the prisoner, at the end of St. Paul's Church-yard, near Cheapside, and gave him into the hands of Ryley.
I am one of the City patrol: On the 1st of June, about two o'clock, Simpson delivered the prisoner into my care, and I took him to the Compter, where I searched him; and found in his bosom, between his waistcoat and shirt, the pocket-book which I gave to Mr. Reed; I asked the prisoner if he had any thing about him before I searched him, and he said, no; he put his hand to his bosom, which led me to suspect him; I searched him, and found it, and then he said he had picked it up.
I am a City officer: The book was delivered to me; on taking off the prisoner's hat, I found five handkerchiefs in it, (produces the book) ; he said he picked the book up, but I saw no mud or dirt upon it.
I was going through St. Paul's Church-yard and picked up the book, I asked the people found if it was their's, they said no, and I put it in my bosom; when I came out of the mob, those gentlemen catched hold of me, and said I had robbed somebody, and took the book away.
