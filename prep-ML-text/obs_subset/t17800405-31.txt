I am a carpenter . The prisoner worked for me. On the 9th of March I think it was, between six and seven in the morning, my boy came up to me and informed me that the prisoner wanted him to go of an errand for him, and that he had some suspicion of him. I got up and looked out at the window and saw the prisoner go out into the middle of the highway and watch the boy out of sight, and then go in and come out again with two deals on his shoulder. I went down without my shoes. There was a constable opening a shop just by; I called to him, and he secured the prisoner. The prisoner owned they were my deals, but said he had asked my leave to take them; to the best of my knowledge he had not.
I am apprentice to Mr. East, in Red-lion-street, Whitechapel . The prisoner asked me that morning to go to the Three Kings or Three Queens, in Whitechapel, to know when the Upminster stage went out; I said I supposed he meant the Three Nuns, as I did not know of any such sign as the Three Kings. He asked me if my master was asleep; I said I did not know. I thought the prisoner had some bad design. I went up and came down, and told him my master was asleep. I then pulled off my shoes, and told my mistress, and she waked my master. I then went to the Three Nuns and they informed me the coach went from the Saracen's Head, Aldgate.
I asked my master on the Saturday to let me have two deals to do a job for myself. He went out of town on Monday. He came home on Wednesday, and asked me if I had had the deals; I told him I had not. He said I might have them when I pleased. I was doing the work for one Mr. Allen, a grocer.
