Are you sure that Mr. Bolt is paid for wharsage?
The sugar had passed the King's beam, he will be paid or ought to be. The head was partly broke in, the prisoner had got his hat full, and he was putting more in his apron, and I took him in that situation; what he had got in his apron was not worth bringing
here because he let it fall down into the mud; I gave the other to the constable, his name is Hunter. I asked him where he came from? he said he worked at the lower station, at Brewer's Key, or it was thereabouts, I understood he meant.
I am a constable; I produce some sugar, I received it of Wood; I have kept it in my possession ever since.
I worked at Chester and Brewer's key, and have always been trusted in the buildings; I had been in the buildings most part of the day, I was admitted a scraper or any thing, when there was nothing to do; this morning there was little to do, we weighed ten hogsheads for shipping; my master told me he had very little to do that day, so he told me, Thomas, you may as well go along with the cooper, and hold the hoops for him, very likely he will give you a bit of sugar when you have done; I went with the cooper, and was with him about four hours; he desired me to get another cask to pitch, and turn them; I did so. When we had done he asked me whether I had an handkerchief to carry a bit of sugar? so I told him no; he said, then take your hat off and he filled my hat; coming along this place there were several people there, I stopped and I took a bit of sugar from there and I eat it; I had my hat on my head with the sugar, and he took me up and sent me to the compter. The sugar was given me by the cooper for assisting to hold the hoops before I came to this place.
Are you sure that you saw him put it in his hat, and put it on his head?
I am.
What may be the value of it altogether?
About half a crown; here is five or six pounds of it.
