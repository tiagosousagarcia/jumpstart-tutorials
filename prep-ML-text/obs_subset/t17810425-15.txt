I live in Hanover-street, Rathbone-place; I am servant to Mrs. Hawkins; at twelve o'clock on Friday night I locked the wash-house door; every thing then was safe in it; the copper and tub were in the wash-house; at seven I went in, and found the house was broke open; the area lock was knocked back; the copper and one of the tubs were missing; afterwards, at Mr. Snarey's house, in Peter-street, I saw the copper; I know it by two marks in it.
I knew the copper before; I went out to look for it; I measured the brick-work where it had been taken from, and found, besides my knowledge of it, that it fitted that measure; the house was broke open as before described; I went in search of the copper; after going to a number of places, I saw it at last at the door of the house of a Mr. Snarey, in Peter-street, near Berwick-street.
I keep a broker's shop in Peter-street. On Saturday, between eight and nine o'clock, the prisoner brought this copper to me; I bought it of him, having known him for twelve months, but did not know where he lived, only I had seen him at the publick-house; I gave him 6 d. a pound for it.
What is the copper worth a pound?
Ten-pence.
I found the copper in the morning beyond the rope-walk.
