I am a taylor ; the articles in the indictment belong to me, except the apron; they were on my shop counter, I saw them about three o'clock in the afternoon; I had been out, and returned about a quarter before four, and was told I was robbed.
I lost a cloth apron; I saw it at three o'clock.
I am a servant; I saw the prisoner go into the house; I was on the same side of the way; in about two minutes after, he came out; I seized him; just before I seized him, he dropped the bundle.
I am a constable; I produce this bundle; I have opened it; I received the bundle of Mrs. Weedon, and have kept it ever since.
