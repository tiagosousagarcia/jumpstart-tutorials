I lived at Cross court, Drury lane , I am a salesman . On the 7th of January the prisoner and two others came into my shop about one o'clock in the day, he asked me to shew him a pair of breeches, I shewed him some, and he pretended there was none to suit him; they then went out all three together. I have a line withinside of my window, upon which I hung up this waistcoat, exposed to sale. I suspected them as soon as they went out of the shop.
Did they meddle with any of the goods.
They did not appear to meddle with any, but my suspicion arose from the trouble they gave me. I missed the waistcoat off the line that minute they went out.
How lately had you seen it.
Just the minute before they came in. I went out after them, I met them coming up my court, in a direction from Drury lane playhouse; the prisoner being the nearest to me I catched hold of him by the collar and brought him into my shop, I then taxed him with robbing me; he said he was very sorry, he would give me any recompence.
What became of his companions.
I do not know, they made their escape. The prisoner in my shop took this waistcoat from under his coat; it cost me five shillings.
Were you in Mr. Marks' shop when the prisoner was there.
Yes, Mr. Marks called me in, he taxed the prisoner with the robbery; the prisoner said he was sorry for it, and he would make him any recompence for it, and then he pulled it out from under his coat.
Did I not say that I did not know that the property was stole at all. One of the young men gave it to me about three or more streets off. I should not have come back to the court if I had known it had been stolen.
That was after he was out of my shop, going to Bow street. The clerk asked if any body had access to the shop as well as myself, I told him my wife had; at the same time before I accused him of the waistcoat, I asked her if she had sold any thing; she then described this waistcoat, and that it was hanging in that situation.
