- I am the wife of John Williams , my husband keeps a public-house in Nightingale-lane : The prisoner lived with me three weeks or a month; about six or seven weeks ago I lost the articles mentioned in the indictment.
How long had she left your service before she was apprehended?
I cannot justly say, because I was brought to-bed, and when I got up I missed these things; and some time after she was apprehended, and on her person was found my cap, and two aprons were found afterwards.
Did you find the table-cloths?
No.
I am a pawnbroker's servant, I live with Mr. Heir, No. 6, in Nightingale-lane: I produce two aprons, the prisoner at the bar pawned them at our shop. (The aprons identified by the Prosecutrix.)
I did not steal these aprons; you brought them to me, and desired me to tie them before me, and you asked me if I had put off the aprons when I came to you; I said they were dirty, I will wash them before I bring them to you; I asked you for my wages, you said, you could not pay me my wages; I pawned your aprons to pay my lodging, I expected my money from you, I worked hard for it; and your husband d - d and swore he would not give me above sixpence a day; I was going to bring them to your house as soon as I got my wages from you; you recollect, your own dear self lent those aprons to me.
(To Prosecutrix.) Did you lend her these things?
I lent her one apron, but I have lost three; she was only to have the same money she had before, that was three shillings a week, and her victuals and drink; I did not lend her the cap that was on her head.
How much was due to her?
I cannot say, whether it was three or four shillings.
After she was gone away, and you missed your things, did you inquire after her?
I did not.
