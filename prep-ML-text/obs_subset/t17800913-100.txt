I live at Mr. Cordy's on Snow-hill . On Tuesday last the prisoner and another woman came into our shop; they asked to see a child's cloak; they did not buy the clock; as soon as they were gone out, I missed the buckles; the apprentice went out and brought them both in; I took them both up stairs, and found the buckles on the prisoner, concealed under her breast.
I am apprentice to Mr. Cordy. Elisabeth Bassey told me she missed a pair of buckles; I went after the woman, and brought her back; she was taken up stairs, and the buckles were found in the prisoner's stays.
I went in with the woman to buy a clock, and she gave me the buckles.
