I am a coach-master , at the Rose and Crown-yard, Knights-bridge: On Friday, the 15th of August, I missed a pair of braces and buckles; I found them in the hands of the watchmen.
I am a watchman belonging to St. George's, Hanover-Square: On the 14th of August, about twenty minutes before eleven, I was walking along the road, and saw a man cutting the braces of a coach; I called to the coachman, but he did not hear me; I stopped him, and he asked me what I wanted with him; I told him, I would let him know, and, if he resisted, I would shoot him, for I had arms about me; he endeavoured to get from me, but I secured him, and took him to the watch-house; he had as many braces and buckles as he could carry, almost, in a bag, and in his pockets; I found this knife open in his pocket. (Produces it).
These are my buckles.
I found them near the Barracks, at Knightsbridge.
