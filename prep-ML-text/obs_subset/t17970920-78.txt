I am an Excise locker; the prisoner was employed in Mr. Bolt's warehouse as a cooper ; as the prisoner was coming along him; and I suspected he had something about him; I communicated my suspicion to Mr. Scovel, who is a Custom-house locker; I went up to the prisoner and stopped him, and began to feel on the outside where I had some suspicion he had got some, and there I felt some coffee-grains; upon which I told him, I believed he had coffee there; he told me he had a little, but he hoped I would let him put it down and go about his business, as he had a wife and family; I told him he must put it into the scales, as it must be weighed; he went up to the scales, and unbuttoned the top part of his breeches, and let all the looie coffee into the scale; it was raw coffee; there were four pounds of it; I sent for a constable, and he took charge of him.
Was that such coffee as was in the warehouse?
I cannot answer for that; there was raw coffee in the warehouse.
Are the hogsheads open?
Some of them.
You did not miss any coffee, I dare say?
No, there was none missing.
What is the value of raw coffee?
I cannot say, I am not a judge of the value; it depends upon the quality.
Is there much coffee in this warehouse?
Yes, three or four hundred casks; it is under the King's lock.
I am a constable: The prisoner was given in charge to me.
I am the Custom-house-keeper of this warehouse of Mr. Bolt's; I had the key on the part of the Customs.
Is that the kind of coffee that was in your, warehouse at that time?
Yes, it is.
Whereabouts is the value of that coffee?
About sixpence a pound.
You will not pretend to say that the whole of it is worth more than eight pence or ten-pence?
No.
