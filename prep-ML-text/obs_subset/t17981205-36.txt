I keep a public-house in Wardour-street ; On the 6th of November, the prisoner came to my house and called for a pint of beer; he went backwards, as if he was going to the vault, and a servant seeing the prisoner in the kitchen, told me of it; I went into the kitchen and missed a pair of candlesticks; I came into the taproom, and charged the prisoner with it; he did not deny it, but pulled them out of his pocket, and gave them to me upon the table.
Did he say any thing?
He seemed to be very much panic struck, and could not say any thing; he was taken by Kennedy, and taken to Marlborough-street; he begged I would look it over, and forgive him.
This man is a man, I believe, who bears a very respectable character?
He does, I believe.
Do you believe that he would have done this if he had not been very much in liquor?
He did not appear to me to be a man who was at all a practitioner in the business.
I happened to be at Mr. Doble's house at the time, I heard him accuse this man of having the candlesticks, and he produced them; that is all I know about it; Mr. Dobie and he had some words, but I did not taken notice of the particulars.
Did the prisoner appear to be in liqour?
I did not take notice of that, because I was in a different box.
I am an officer belonging to Marlborough-street; On the 6th of November, the prosecutor applied to me to take the prisoner into custody; I went to his house, and the prosecutor said, there is the prisoner, and there is the candlesticks, they were standing upon the table before the prisoner when I went in, (produces them) I have has them ever since.
Are these the same candlesticks that you lost?
Yes, they are.
