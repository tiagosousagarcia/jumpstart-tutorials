I am a patrole of St. Margeret's, I was going to the watch house about a quarter before nine, I saw the man with the rope at his back, I went up to him and asked him how he came by it? he said he found it about two hours before with a load of dust; says I, you must come along with me to the watch-house, and he had not been in the watch-house half an hour before he owned he took it from the dray.
I had left my master about half an hour, and I was coming out of the Windmill where they were laying this beer down, and I saw this rope in the middle of the road, and I picked it up and put it across my shoulder, and I was taking it to my mother's house, and my mother was not at home, and I was going down to my master's house, and I was taken.
In what manner had you left this rope?
I lapped it up round and round as we always do, and left it on the dray with the pin, and when I came out the rope was missing, and the pin was in the street.
