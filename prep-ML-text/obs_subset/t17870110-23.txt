I live in Brook-street, Ratcliffe ; I work at Squire Bowles's glass-house; my wife informed me of the loss of the things, on the 15th of December; the prisoner lived with me, I gave him board and washing, and lodging for eleven weeks; he told me he was robbed when he came from Greenland; I have had him three voyages; he is no relation to me; the prisoner was gone on board the Hawke Indiaman, and I went after him, on the 15th of December, between six and seven in the morning; he had been on board from the 10th, when he left my house, to the 15th; I knew where he was going, and I sent a man down with him to carry his things for him; I did not know of the loss of the things till the 14th, my wife was afraid to tell me; when I saw him, I beckoned to him; I said Charley, you are guilty of bad manners, let me have them; he said he had sold them out and out in Rag-fair.
I am as clear of it, as God is of sin.
