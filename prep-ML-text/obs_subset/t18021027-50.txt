Mrs. Mary Littlewood is a widow, and keeps a house in the parish of Hendon ; I am her mower , and left my great coat in the tool-house, which does not adjoin the dwelling-house; on Thursday, about eleven o'clock, I went away, and the next day I missed my coat, and have never seen it since.
I know Mrs. Littlewood, and am servant to her, and I know Richard Richards , who is a labouring man; his great coat was left in the tool-house on Thursday; I saw it, and took it out of that house into the kitchen, and hung it up, about half past six in the evening; the kitchen is part of the house; the prisoner was at work at our house, and was discharged that night; about a quarter before seven he made a great enquiry for this coat, swearing and saying it was his; I brought it to the door, and threw it down, saying it was Richards's coat, and would swear to it; he said it was his, and demanded it of me; he took it up, went away with it, and nobody has seen it since; I did not hear any thing of the prisoner till he was brought to Bow-street about a fortnight after, when I was sent for.
I was employed to work in the family of Mrs. Littlewood, and know the coat to be the prosecutor's; I saw it in the tool-house on the 9th of September, but did not see see it in the kitchen; I gave information where the prisoner was, and he was taken up on Monday the 20th; he owned he took it at Bow-street.
I am a mower, the prisoner was a haymaker; I have known him about a fortnight in the fields.
Was there more than one great coat?
No; the prisoner had none.
I have heard the prisoner say it was a noble great coat, and told me to take care of it.
I don't know any more of it than the child unborn.
