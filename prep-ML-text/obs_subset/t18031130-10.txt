I live in the parish of St. Botolph, Aldgate , and keep the Seven-stars public-house : On the 25th of August the prisoner was quartered at my house; and on the 31st of October, our servant was cleaning the room where the prisoner slept, and behind a table she found some pawnbroker's duplicates, some in his name, and she brought them down stairs. I had missed some table-cloths out of a basket that came from the mangler's, the prisoner was out; when he came home, I taxed him with the things; he did not deny it, but gave me the duplicates out of his pocket.
I am a pawnbroker: I received a pair of stockings of the prisoner on the 31st of October. (The stockings produced and identified.)
I am a pawnbroker: On the 29th of October, the prisoner pledged a table-cloth with me, for one shilling and sixpence.
I am an officer: I took the prisoner; I searched him but found nothing; I searched his knap-sack, and found two odd stockings, the fellows of those pawned.
I live with Mr. Gell, a pawnbroker: The prisoner pawned a tablecloth and sheet, the 29th of October, which I produce; the table-cloth for one shilling and sixpence, and the sheet for two shillings.
I leave myself to the mercy of the Court.
