You are a porter belonging to Gray's Inn coffee-house.
I am; on Sunday the 25th of May I saw the prisoner upon the top of the building in Holborn court , I saw him walk backwards and forwards, I gave information to one of the waiters; I am sure the prisoner is the person, he was there by himself.
What are you.
I am one of the porters to Gray's Inn; in consequence of information I went to Mr. Dauncy's chambers, I met the prisoner on the third pair of stairs, I asked him what he had got under his coat, he said a little bit of lead, he put it down and I took it up; I produce it; I went with the plumber's man to match the lead with the place, it fitted exactly.
I am one of the porter's of Gray's Inn, I went up stairs and met the prisoner at the bar coming down, I perceived he had got something under his coat, the edge appeared like lead, he put it down, I knew him before by being a workman on the place belonging to Mr. Mansfield.
I am a servant to Mr. Covey, a plumber, I fitted the lead to the place and it exactly tallied.
How much is there taken.
Ten pounds all but two ounces, there was a considerable quantity beside this that had been taken off; it was first entered with a knife, and then tore off.
What was he.
A bricklayer's labourer.
You I believe are the steward of Gray's Inn.
I am; at No. 2, Holborn court, Mr. Dauncy is the proprietor of the chambers.
I was going to a country job to Dover barrack buildings, I went up for my tools, I found this lead, and I was going to bring it home for safety to my master.
(to Mr. Quin) Was the roof repairing at that time.
It has been repaired some little time past, I do not think it was under repair at the time the lead was stole.
