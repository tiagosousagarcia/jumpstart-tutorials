I am a coachman . I lost my coat last Sunday was sennight, at night, in Bishopsgate-street , from my box; it was about eight o'clock; I did not see it taken, a man saw it taken, and stopped the prisoner; I was looking after passengers to go to Hackney.
I saw the prisoner take the great coat off the box of the last witness Sewell on Sunday was sennight at night, and he ran away, and I ran after him, he dropped if, and a gentleman stopped him; I saw him drop it, and he was secured. The coat was taken up and kept in the possession of the owner, he has it now. The coat produced.
The coat was laying on the ground when I crossed the highway, this man crossed and asked me where I got it, and I told him I picked it up. I am a sugar baker ; I have no friends here, they did not know I should be tried to-night.
