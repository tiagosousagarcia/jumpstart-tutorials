I lost a brass collar, on the 11th of April, in Hungerford-market ; it was on a bitch's neck.
Is the prisoner any relation to you?
None. One of Sir John Fielding 's men brought the collar to my house; it has my name and place of abode upon it.
We went, upon an information we had received, to the prisoner's house, upon the 18th of April; it is in a little court, in Water-lane, Fleet-street; we went to search for some dogs that were lost. We found four dogs alive, and in the yard we found the carcases of nine dogs which had been skinned, and three carcases more in another place. We found the carcase of the bitch skinned, and this collar lying on a shelf.
I was out on the 11th of April. William Howard and William Downs came together to my house, as my wife informed me, and desired to leave this collar upon the shelf.
The prisoner told me he would send my bitch home the next day. I had six puppies at home starving for want of her.
I was charing at the prisoner's; two men came, and desired to leave a collar there, which they said they would call for in the morning; I did not look at the collar.
