I was coming along the 27th of June, about five, I saw the prisoner looking at the gentleman's pocket, then I saw the prisoner put his hand into his right hand pocket, and take the handkerchief; the gentleman was a servant out of place, his name was Leonard, he said he lived in Villars-street, he did not attend at the examination, the prisoner said nothing; we took hold of him, and the gentleman that lost it took it out of the prisoner's breast before my face.
I picked up the handkerchief.
