On the 10th instant my house was robbed; about half after twelve I came home; I went to meet a man that had been inquiring for work, and I said I will give you a winter's work; and I gave him sixpence for dinner; he said he had no money.
About seven in the evening, I saw the prisoner with a linen gown, I should know it again; he offered it me for sale for two shillings and a pot of twopenny, and I bought it of him.
I had the gown from James Smith 's house, in the morning after the robbery.
I found the gown near Turnham Green.
