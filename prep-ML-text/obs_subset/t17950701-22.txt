What have you to say against the prisoner?
She robbed me, picked my pocket, the 17th of May, in George-street, Spitalfields ; I was in a room along with her in the house of a man named George Rose ; she was at the door first, and I went in along with her up stairs into the room, it was about three o'clock in the morning when I first see her; I slept in the room with her till seven o'clock; I went into the public house and had some beer, and went into the room about eleven o'clock again with her, and she picked my pocket five minutes after I had been in the room; we had not been on the bed three minutes before somebody knocked at the door, she jumped up immediately, and I perceived my money was gone; four guineas and two half guineas, I cannot say exactly to the silver.
Was any body else in the room with you?
No.
When was it that you found the money in your pocket?
After I returned to the public house.
Had you felt it after you got into the room with her?
Yes.
What was it in?
In a leather purse.
Did you examine the room?
I looked outside of the bed, I did not examine the house further than that; I went out of the house immediately to see her, but I could not see any thing of her. I was not dead drunk, I was about half and half, I was sensible.
On the 18th of May, (ten days afterwards) the prosecutor came to me at the Flying Horse, and I went with him and apprehended the prisoner, and I found two sixpences on her.
