The prisoner came into my shop the 20th of February, a quarter past four in the afternoon, with an intention of buying two yards of black linen, to pin before her child, I saw her in the shop, one of my shopmen waited on her, I had another customer the other side of the counter, I saw the prisoner going out, I asked if she had bought any thing, he said no; I was sent for to a pawnbroker's in Oxford-street, about two hours after, to see if I knew a piece of cotton that was there, I knew it to be mine, five yards, there were two shop marks, a C and L, which I mark all the goods I buy, I was convinced it was mine, I did not miss it out of the shop.
the prisoner came in about four o'clock, she wanted a piece of black linen for pin-cloths, I fetched her another piece, she went out, I saw her take nothing, I missed nothing, till we were informed what we had missed, then I missed a remnant of cotton which laid in the window the day before, I looked for it then, I knew the prisoner again, it was about four minutes she was in the shop, I never saw her before, she is the same person.
Green, servant to the prosecutor, I saw the cotton in the window on that day, between ten and four, nearest to four, I saw it in the window that day, it was our pattern.
Here are five yards and a half of cotton, I had it of the prisoner at the bar, between five and six in the evening, I have known her four years, her husband is an engraver or jeweller, she wanted fifteen shillings on it; I asked her how she came by it, and she said she bought it that day, the corner of Hayes Court, I went there and they said they knew nothing of it, then she said she had it of Mr. Wollerton, he came, and she swore she bought it of him, he remembered seeing it in Mr. Calthrop's shop; we went and fetched him, he came and owned it, we kept her in the parlour, this is the piece of cotton I had of her.
