I live at Upper Clapton , and am a calico printer , the prisoner worked for me about two years: On the 12th of December, I had a parcel of pieces to print; I gave them to her to look over, and see they were not damaged; she came and told me one piece ran short, that there was only half a piece; I said, it must have been cut on my premises; I took the piece with me to the person I had it from, and he said it must have been cut at my place; the thread was rent; that passed on till the next Tuesday; the prisoner did not come to work that week; in consequence of information, I found the calico at a mantua-maker's in Sandford-lane, Stoke Newington; I saw a gown made up laying on the table, and the end of the cotton, which matched with mine, laying by it; I had the prisoner taken up to Worship-street. (Produces the piece found at the mantua-maker's.)
I am a mantua-maker, in Sandford-lane: On Tuesday evening, the 12th of December, about eight o'clock, the prisoner brought me ten yards of cotton, and asked me if I could make a gown and coat that week; I said I was busy, but if she particularly wanted it, I would do it; she said, it was not for her, but a young woman, and if I fitted her, it would fit the young woman, who was the same size; she came on Saturday, and asked if it was done; I said, yes; she said, she would take the petticoat, and leave the gown till Monday, and I did not see her again; the piece found there was part of the ten yards she brought. (Produces the gown.)
I have nothing to say.
