The prisoner lived with me a week, she came to me the 14th of February, I missed the sheets mentioned in the indictment, likewise a silver table spoon and a tea spoon, and a damask breakfast cloth; on the 25th, I took her in Penton-street, at the pawnbroker's, she was searched, and the spoons were found upon her; I saw them taken from her, here is my own cypher upon them, they have been in the possession of the constable ever since; the silver spoon had been broken and mended.
What did she say for herself?
She said the devil was in her, and she could not help it.
I put them in my pocket, I did not design to make them away; I hope you will have some pity upon me, as I am a strange girl; I have not a friend within two hundred miles.
