I live with Mr. Parke; I am his porter : I lost my watch and money on the 25th of April; I had been to Pimlico; I met the prisoner and another woman, and they asked me to give them a glass of liquor; I did so; I went into Parker's-lane with them, I was sleepy, I laid my head down, and I felt something about my pockets, and I missed my watch and money, and saw the girl run out of the room; she made her escape.
I got the duplicate by telling her, I would make it easy to her.
Mr. Price came to me the day after he was robbed; I went after her and found her; she confessed at last she had the watch and money of him, but it was all gone; so then I told her I would take her before a magistrate.
The prosecutor left me the watch till he called next day.
