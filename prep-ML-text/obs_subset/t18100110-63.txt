My husband's name is James Mc'Guire, I live at No. 5, Caroline-court, Saffron Hill ; I am a lodger. On the 26th of December I sent the prisoner out for the milk; (I am in the milk business; the prisoner was my servant ) I sent her out about six o'clock, she did not return. I went to look for my silk handkerchief to put on, I could not find it; I missed one of my children's frocks and a shawl. I saw no more of the prisoner till New Years Day, I found her in Rosemary-lane, I sent for an officer and had her taken in custody, and some duplicates were found upon her.
I am a constable, I apprehended the prisoner on New Years Day; she said she did take a frock and a shawl, but the great coat and handkerchief her mistress lent her; I searched her, I found four duplicates; she told me of another duplicate at Mrs. Eversall's in Rosemary-lane, that is the duplicate of the great coat; I have got all the duplicates. The prisoner had this pint pot knocked up in her pocket.
I am a pawnbroker, East Smithfield; a frock was pledged with me for one shilling and six-pence; I have no recollection of the prisoner.
I am an apprentice to Mr. Hill, pawnbroker, 81, Cable-street, Wellclose-square. On the 26th of December the prisoner pledged a shawl with me for one shilling.
I am a pawnbroker, 105, in the Minories. I produce a silk handkerchief that was pawned with me on the morning of the 26th of December; I do not know enough of the prisoner so as to swear to her person.
I am a pawnbroker, 5, Ship-alley, Wellclose-square; I took in pawn a woman's great coat of a girl; not the prisoner.
The prisoner came to my mother on the 1st of January and asked her if she would have the duplicate of a great coat; my mother said she did not like to buy it without seeing it; I took it out of pledge; my mother did not think it worth the money she asked, I went and pledged it again; the constable came and had the duplicate.
I used to get up at four o'clock and work hard for my living.
