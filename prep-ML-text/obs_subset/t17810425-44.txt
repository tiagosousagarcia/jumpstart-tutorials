I am a linen-draper in the Minories . Last Wednesday night, about nine o'clock, I was writing at my desk. I heard the cry of Stop thief! I went out, and met my neighbour, Mr. Jackson, who gave me this linen; I know it to be my property, and that it was taken out of my shop.
I am a haberdasher, and live within two doors of Mr. Adams. Between eight and nine o'clock last Wednesday evening, while I was standing at my door, I saw the prisoner running, and two boys after him calling Stop thief! Before he came up to me, he turned off the foot-path, and I saw him throw down this piece of callico just before me; I picked it up, and he was immediately taken. I came back to my own door: Mr. Adams came up and said it was his property.
I am apprentice to Mr. Slocombe. Going down the Minories, I saw the prisoner lurking about the prosecutor's door; I stopped to watch him; I saw him make one attempt to go into the shop, but he did not; but the second time he went in, I saw him come out with a piece of cloth under his coat; I ran after him with the cry of stop thief! I saw him drop the piece, which this gentleman picked up, and he was immediately taken.
