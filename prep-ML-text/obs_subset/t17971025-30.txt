I keep a shop in Newgate-market ; I killed twenty lambs about three weeks ago, I do not know what day it was, and in the night I lost one; it was brought to me the next morning from Mrs. Rutter.
I stopped the prisoner at the bar with a carcase of lamb upon his back, I asked him where he got it; he said, he bought it; that was in Three-tun-passage, leading from Newgate-market, near about twelve o'clock at night; he was very much in liquor, and he threw it down, whether accidently or purposely I cannot tell; he took it upon his shoulders again and pitched it down in the Market; he was delivered to the watchman, but he is not here; he was not bound over.
Then there is a defect of evidence, the prisoner must be acquitted.
