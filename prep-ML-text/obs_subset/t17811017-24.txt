I live at Kingston . My maid left the linen out in a back-yard on Wednesday morning. On Thursday morning it was gone.
Last Thursday morning, between seven and eight o'clock, I saw the prisoner coming along, with a bundle under his arm, in Westminster. I pursued him, and cried out, Stop thief! I saw him drop the bundle. A man took the bundle up, and another man stopped him. I saw him take the bundle up, and give it to the constable. It was the same I saw the boy drop. I had it from the constable the next day. The constable is not here. I saw the bundle opened before it was given to the constable. The things are the same as they are mentioned in the indictment.
Some of the things mentioned in the indictment are the property of my maid. She is not here. There are two partners in the house. Some things were stolen belonging to each of us. To prevent us both appearing, he gave them to me, after they were lost.
Two young lads went down, as they said, to see their aunt; and they brought these things to me in a handkerchief, and desired me to carry them.
