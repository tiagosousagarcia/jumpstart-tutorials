I live in Pye street , the prisoner lodged with me in the one pair of stairs; she took the room to herself; she hired it; I lost my sheets; I missed them a week after she had been in the lodging; she had not left the lodging; I asked her for the rent, the week was up, and she said she had no money; I went to look at the bed and the sheets was gone; she said she had pawned them; I bad her get them out; she went to get them out and ran away; she said she could not get them out without I would pay the money myself, I took her into custody.
Did you give her leave to pawn them?
No.
Did you know she had pawned them before' you missed them?
Yes, one of then other lodgers told me.
I took these sheets of the prisoner, I live in Stretton Ground, she brought them is her own property, one the 22d and the other the 24th of March; she pledged one for sixpence the other for eighteen-pence; she had used the shop about a month or six weeks; I never saw any thing amiss by her.
I was very ill and very much distressed; it was my intention to get them again.
What are you?
Any thing.
Have you any friends?
Not in London.
Have you any body to give you a character?
Nobody here at all; the prosecutor had the money of me to redeem the sheets, and then he kept it for his expences.
I took it in part of rent, she was then committed, and I was bound to prosecute her; and some man came and gave me two shillings in part of the rent, which was three shillings.
Did the man mean to pay it you as rent?
Yes, he said he would pay it me for rent.
He took the money, and said, let us see what I can do for you; and when he had got it, he said, I will keep it for my expences.
Did the man promise to pay you the rest of the rent?
Yes.
Did not he give you that two shillings, in order to shew the woman mercy?
He did not say any thing about that.
