I am a baker , and the prisoner was my journeyman ; I observed him with something hid under his coat, searched him, and found several of these loaves, (producing them) ; and the rest were hid in the bake-house.
When I went to work with my master, it was agreed I should have a weekly allowance of bread; he having a large quantity of loaves on hand, proposed that he and I should fill baskets, and sell them in St. Giles's at a low price; not doing so, it was to be kept for my use, and it was kept till it became so mouldy I could not eat it, and I made those cakes to eat instead, and not to sell.
