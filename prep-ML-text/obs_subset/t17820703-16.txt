On the 6th of June, I was called up a little before six in the morning. I found the prisoner in custody; and the things mentioned in the indictment, which were my husband's property, were in the passage.
Foster lodges in my house. I came down in the morning, before six o'clock. I found the door open. While I was sweeping the door, the prisoner came out. Upon my stopping her, she threw down a bundle in the passage. I secured her.
The bundle was given me in the street by a gentleman.
