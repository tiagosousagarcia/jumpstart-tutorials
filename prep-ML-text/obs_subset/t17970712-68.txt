I am servant to Mrs. Mary Hargrave, a publican : About eight o'clock, on the 8th of this month, I waited in the parlour, and the table-cloth was then on the table, at supper; about half past eleven I removed it from the table and put it upon the bar-door; it was not missed till the next morning.
The table-cloth was missing on the Sunday, and I suspected the prisoner; I went to the pawnbroker, Mr. Patmore's, upon Ludgate-hill, and there I found it; the prisoner and her husband were both at our house that evening.
Did you see the prisoner and her husband there?
Yes.
What time did the husband leave the house?
I did not see him leave the house.
I am servant to Mr. Patmore, (produces the table-cloth) ; the prisoner at the bar brought it to us on the 10th of this month, she told me it was her own.
My husband drives a dust-cart, he found it amongst some rubbish and dirt, and I pledged it.
