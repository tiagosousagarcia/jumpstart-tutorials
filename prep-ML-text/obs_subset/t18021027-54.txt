I am a cheesemonger , in Brick-lane, Spital fields : On the 29th of September, between eight and nine o'clock in the evening, I was behind the counter serving some customers, and I heard a noise behind some tubs of butter on the other side of the shop, opposite the door; I looked at the place where the bacon did lay, and missed it, it weighed about fourteen pounds; the people standing before me, prevented my seeing who took it; I ran down the next street, and took the prisoner with it under his arm; he asked me what I was going to do with him, I said, I would let him know presently, and I took him to my shop till an officer came. (The bacon was produced and identified.)
I was going on an errand to the Minories, and saw a man with this bacon, he said, he would give me two-pence to carry it; I was going along with it, and that man came out, and said, where are you going with that, and laid hold of me; I asked him what he was going to do with me, and he took me into the shop.
