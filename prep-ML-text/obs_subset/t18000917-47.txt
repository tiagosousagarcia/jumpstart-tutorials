I keep a hosier's shop , in Oxford-street : On Saturday the 30th of August, between eight and nine in the evening, I lost a whole piece of flannel from my shop, I had seen it not five minutes before I missed it; we were very busy, as we generally are on a Saturday; myself, my wife and servant were in the shop at the time; I was serving some stockings, and Mrs. Towns was serving some stockings; the moment I missed the flannel, I jumped over the counter, ran right across the other side of the street, and saw the prisoner; I caught hold of him about fifty or sixty yards from my own door, with the flannel in his arms; I brought him back with the property, and from there took him to the watch-house, and gave charge of him to the watch-house keeper; it cost me one shilling and ten-pence a yard, it is a whole piece; they generally are from forty to forty-seven yards, but sometimes they run short; I value it at one shilling a yard; I am sure it is my flannel.
A woman told me, if I would carry that to the stage, at Swallow-street, she would give me sixpence, and I had not carried it far, before the gentleman laid hold of me.
