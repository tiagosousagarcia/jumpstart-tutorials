On the evening before Good-Friday, I missed the things mentioned in the indictment (repeating them.)
Do you recollect the day of the month?
No.
Where did you lose them from?
A three-pair of-stairs back room in my house. The prisoner lodged in that room. They were all there when she took the room. She had the room about three weeks or a month. When I missed them I made a search after the prisoner; she went out on the Thursday morning. I found her on the Friday afternoon at a publick-house in Windmill-street. I thought by her not coming home all Thursday night; that she had left the room. When I found her I asked her what she had done with the things. She was very much in liquor, and gave me several answers. I took her to my house, and sent for a constable.
What time did you take her?
About one o'clock. I sent for the constable at about five o'clock.
What did she say about the things?
Nothing, in particular. She told me of four articles that evening before the magistrate.
Was she sober then?
I believe she was. She told me the things were at three pawnbrokers, and mentioned all the things I had lost. She said three articles were at Parker's in Princes-street; and I found them there; they were, a tea-kettle, flat-iron, and window curtain. She said she was sorry she had done it, and she would pay me so much a week if I would not prosecute her. I said I would not take any thing of her, but if she would tell me where all the things were I would not trouble myself about it.
Was that before she told you where the things were?
Yes. She would not tell me where all the things were.
I am a pawnbroker. The prisoner pawned a flat-iron, a window curtain, and tea-kettle with me for half a crown. She said she got them from her sister.
Did you know her before?
Yes. She used to live with her sister, who takes in washing.
I went out on Thursday morning; while I was out Mr. Greenwood, who had a false key, went into the room. I had not left the lodging.
