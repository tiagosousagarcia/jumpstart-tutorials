I keep the Golden Lion, a publick-house, at the corner of Great Earl-street . On the 24th of July, in the afternoon I lost a silver pint mug. I had seen it in the parlour at about four o'clock. I missed it at about ten o'clock at night.
What is the value of it?
It was bought by my father fifteen years ago; I heard him say he gave three pound sixteen shillings for it.
Is it worth so much as 40 s.?
I cannot take upon me to swear that it is now worth forty shillings.
I live servant with Mr. Street. The prisoner came into my master's house on the 24th of July, between five and six o'clock for a quartern of gin; I served her in the tap-room; she went away soon after. The mug was missed at night.
On the 24th of July, while I was standing at my door, between nine and ten o'clock at night the prisoner came and asked me if I knew which was one Mealing's. Seeing something stick out under her cloak, I turned her cloak aside, and saw a silver pint mug under it. I secured it and her. She was next day carried before a magistrate. She said she found the mug. Upon enquiry I found that the mug belonged to Mr. Street.
I picked the mug up in a passage; I shewed it to a woman; she said it was plate. I asked her what I should do with it? She directed me to Mr. Mealing's.
