I am a tallow-chandler , the prisoner was taken with 4 papers of starch.
I get my living in the streets, I am what they call a Castar - . I met this lad coming through the lane from the half-way house Redman's-Row, he had 4 papers of starch in his apron, there was another boy with him, I suspected they had stolen something, I took him and Price going to the watch-house; Mr. Newell came out, he was about a quarter of a mile from Newell's house; I saw this boy hand the starch over the bank. I went up to him and he seemed to be easing himself; I asked what he had there, he said some starch, he was going with it to Catherine Wheel Alley; that was about ten o'clock in the morning, I think on Saturday the 7th of July.
This boy was brought by my door and I missed 4 papers of starch, they supported some rushes in my window, when I discovered the loss the rushes were all loose; it is marked by the starch-makers and the Excise officers.
I produce the Starch
This starch exactly corresponds with the starch I had at home, and is marked No. 52. I cannot say what number of papers I had in the house; the starch might cost about 13 s.
A man offered me a shilling to carry it to Ratcliff-Highway, and ran away while I was easing myself.
