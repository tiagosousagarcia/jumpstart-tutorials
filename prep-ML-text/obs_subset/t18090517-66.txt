My husband's name is Peter Wilson, he is a mariner ; my house is in St. George's in the East . On Saturday the 5th of May, I left my parlour about five minutes before five o'clock, and went into my kitchen, I left the tea tray there; Mrs. Vyse my neighbour, came and told me she saw a woman go down the street with it under her arm; I immediately went and looked for her, and by the description that Mrs. Vyse gave me of the person, I knew it to be a person that cried old clothes in the neighbourhood.
Did you ever find the tea tray again
No.
What is the prisoner
The prisoner cried old clothes .
On the 5th of May, I saw the prisoner go into Mrs. Wilson's house, she had no tea tray with her then; I saw her come out with a tea tray under her arm, half covered with a cloak: I knew it to be Mrs. Wilson's tray; I have often seen it in Mrs. Wilson's house. I went and informed Mrs. Wilson; I know the prisoner by going through the street crying old clothes. I am sure she is the woman.
I saw the prisoner come out of Mrs. Wilson's house with the tea tray; and she passed me at my own door with the tea tray under her arm. I am sure she is the woman.
My prosecutrix came to me in Rosemary-lane, where I get my bread; she told me she was informed that I was the person that came out of her house with the tea tray under my cloak; I told her I would go with her any where; I knew nothing of her tea tray. I said ma'am, you know me well enough to think better of me. I gave her a direction to come to me in the morning, she never came nigh me in the morning; I waited till half past ten o'clock, and then I went down to her house, to know who was the person that informed her that I had the tea tray under my cloak; I had no cloak on, I had not been in the neighbourhood two months; she said she would not prosecute me if I would tell her where the tea tray was, I told her I did not know any thing of it; I said I would sooner tell her if could, than he taken to a prison.
