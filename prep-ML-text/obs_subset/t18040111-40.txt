The prisoner worked for me four days; I know nothing of it myself.
I am the son of the last witness, who is a lamp-contractor ; the prisoner was one of our lamp-lighter s; he commenced working for my father on the 3d. Having a suspicion, I went on the 6th to look after him on the Stamford-hill Road ; I found him\\ light\\ ing his work between five and six o'clock, with a stone bottle strapped to the side of his ladder; he seemed confused, and I asked him to let me have some of his burners, to see if the oil was chilled; I looked at half a dozen, which I made him bring down to me, and there was not one that had one-third of the oil that was allowed; I asked him what he was going to do with the stone bottle; he said, he was going to take it to his father; I asked him where he got it from; he said, some landlord down the road had given it him; I asked him what his father was going to do with it; he said, he did not know; I asked him if there was any thing in it; he said there was nothing in it that he knew of; while he was up the ladder I felt the weight of the bottle, and found it nearly full of oil (produces it) it is Greenland whale oil, and answers to the sample that he took out; I then left him, and watched him; I suddenly missed the bottle from the ladder; I then looked about the spot, but could not see any thing of it; I watched him till he had done his work; I saw him come out of a public-house, and go towards home; I did not see him go into the public-house; I got up early the next morning as soon as it was light, and found the bottle of oil upon the path-way in a parallel line with two lamp-posts; I procured a constable, and took him up while he was at work; he said, he was very sorry for what he had done; it was the first time he had taken any; he said, the first time he went out he had a pint and a half left, and his fellow-servant told him he might have it if he got a bottle to put it in.
I did not take it with a view of making a property of it.
