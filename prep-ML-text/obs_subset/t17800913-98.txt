The prisoner was my servant ; she was in my service till August. The things mentioned in the indictment were all in a spare bed-room, except one gown; no person went into that room but the prisoner, except the family.
She lived servant with me eleven months. The things mentioned in the indictment (repeating them) were missed, and some of them were found in her boxes. I had a good opinion of her, and gave her a good character when she left my service.
I am a constable. These things (producing a box) I found in the prisoner's lodging on the 21st of August. She said her master the prosecutor gave them to her.
We found the box at her lodgings, in Charterhouse-lane. I found a bundle at a gentleman's house in Marlborough-street, where she used to visit the servants. The maid servant produced them to us. The prisoner said the bundle was her property, and that her master and mistress gave them to her.
These are some of the things which were at my house; my little grandaughter brought them to me; she is about eleven years old; my own daughter's child.
Do you know that the prisoner at the bar had them?
No. Ann Aldridge sent these things to me by her daughter; the prisoner knows nothing at all about them.
