I am a shoe-maker in Butcher-row . The 1st of February, a gentleman came from his carriage, and knocked at my door, and informed me that a soldier had taken a boot from my window, and which way he was gone; I went after him; I came up with the prisoner, and asked him for the boot? he said he had not got it; I told him a gentleman had informed me so; he still persisted he had it not; he went farther, and there was another in a smock frock, an accomplice, with him; I said, I will not quit you till I am positive; and he said I must take him before a magistrate; but the people came up, and I insisted upon searching him; upon which he gave me the boot out of his pocket; before the Justice he said, coming through the row, a man with a smock frock came up to him, but first he denied that there was such a man, but that he followed him.
Coming down Butcher-row, this young fellow in a smock frock came up towards me; he said, soldier, where are you going? I said, to my quarters; where? says he, says I, at the Bunch of Grapes, just by; he gave me the boot to take to my quarters, and said he would call for it in a quarter of an hour.
