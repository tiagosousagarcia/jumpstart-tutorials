I live at No. 5, Bucklersbury : On the 8th of October, about six o'clock in the afternoon, I went to the back of the warehouse, I saw the prisoner come to the front counter; I lost two cotton counterpanes; he had one in his hand, when he saw me he put it back on the counter, and asked me the way to Lothbury; I looked round and missed one piece; I examined him about it, and he denied it; I went to the door to see if I could see any body else, but there was nobody else near, that piece has never been recovered; I sent for a constable, and he was committed.
This is my counterpane.
I sell fish ; the gentleman told me to bring him some fish, and he would pay me for it; I went, and the gentleman came out and laid hold of me, and said, he had lost a parcel, and if I did not tell him where it was, he would do me if he could.
