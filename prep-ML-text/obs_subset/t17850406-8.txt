I am a cooper; the prisoner worked journey-work with me at the time that he offered these staves to sell; which was about the 8th of March, he offered twenty-nine staves to me to sell; he brought them in a bag at two or three times; at last he brought the heads, and on one there was a mark of Munday, and on the other the mark of Charrington; then I told him I would not have any concern with them, because I thought they were stolen; I desired him to take them away; he said he would, but he did not; I informed the prosecutors, and they came and claimed them.
Do you know whether the staves belonged to these heads?
The prisoner told me they did; he told me there were fourteen or fifteen.
Is that about the quantity?
Generally, but sometimes there are more and sometimes less; he said he bought them of a young man; he scratched the burnt marks out of the head of the casks, after they were brought to our house, as he told me.
Can you tell where this cask was taken from?
I cannot be sure; he told the Justice he found one in Little Britain, and the other in Cheapside; and he told the cooper he bought them of a young fellow.
I saw two heads belonging to a hogshead of John and Harry Charrington , I know the mark; we cannot keep any account of where the casks are.
Coming from work one night, I found one of them in Cheapside, and the other in Little Britain.
What in one night?
No, one about a week after the other; they lay in the kennel; between eight and nine.
Then how came you to say you had bought them of a young man?
I never said any such thing.
Have you any body to prove that you found them?
There were a great many people saw me pick them up.
Are any of them here?
Not that I know of.
Have you any friends here?
I expected a couple, I do not know whether they are come or not.
