I live at Iver in Buckinghamshire. Last Monday night about three quarters after six o'clock I lost a box out of the Iver waggon, by the Saracen's Head gate-way . I was in the waggon at the time.
What part of the waggon was the box in?
About the middle; I saw the prisoner get into the tail of the waggon at the corner of the Old Bailey, and pull the box to the tail of the waggon. I lost him till I came to the Inn; then I saw him get in and take the box. I went after him and took him with it on his shoulder. My waggon was robbed before; but detecting them in the waggon, I could do nothing with them. Therefore I did not interrupt him while he was in the waggon.
Are you sure the man that removed the box in the Old Bailey, is the same man who took the box out?
Yes.
And that man is the prisoner?
Yes. He looked into the waggon several times as I came down Fleet-street; at the end of the Old Bailey he got into it, and drew this box to the tail of the waggon; when we came to the Saracen's Head he got into the waggon again and took the box out. I went after him and laid hold of him, he knocked me down, and said he was not the man; that the man with the box had ran up a court. I took him with it on his shoulder.
I was in my master's shop opposite the Saracen's Head. I heard the cry of murder! I opened the door and went out immediately; I saw Parker on his back in the kennel, and the prisoner upon him beating him; I asked what what was the matter? Parker said he was robbed. I took the prisoner by the collar and secured him.
I am entirely innocent of it.
