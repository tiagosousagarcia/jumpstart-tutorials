I am the wife of Christopher Gearish, a salesman in Covent-Garden; on the 15th of June last, Esther Knightley came to live with me, and on the 22d of July, when we went home, about half after eleven at night, the door was locked, and we could not get in; we had left Esther Knightley in the house; when we had got in, I went into the kitchen, and there was a large fire, and a candle on the table; the dining-room door was locked, and the key put under the mat, the drawers in the dining-room were broke open, and the property mentioned in the indictment was gone; there were 202l. in Banknotes, and 107l. in cash, gone, besides my table-linen, and other things. I found a cloth apron of mine, marked, upon the prisoner, and a gown that she had pledged for Esther Knightley ; she owned that she had given her the duplicate; and a black silk cloak, pledged in her own name.
This gown was pledged with me on the 5th of August, in the name of Sarah Anderson ; I cannot be quite positive that the prisoner is the person that pledged it.
This is my gown.
This cloak was pledged with me on the 9th of August, by the prisoner at the bar, in the name of Anderson.
This is my cloak.
