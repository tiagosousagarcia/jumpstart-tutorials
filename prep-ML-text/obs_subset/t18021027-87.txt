I am a stationer in Jewry-street, Aldgate : On Wednesday the 27th of October, about half past two in the day, my door being open, the house being under repair, the prisoner came in, and passed all the workmen; there were seven of them; I was up stairs, and they supposed he was coming to me; but instead of that, he went into the two-pair-of-stairs room, where there were two gowns and a petticoat, which had been put there about five minutes before; he immediately put them under his jacket, and went down stairs; a carpenter followed him, and brought him back with the property; I asked him where he got them; he said he got them up stairs; I sent for a constable, and gave charge of him.
I am a carpenter; I stopped the prisoner, and brought him back; I told him he had got more than he should have, and he said he knew that; I brought him back, unbuttoned his jacket, and there were two gowns and a petticoat.
Was he sober?
Yes.
I had been only three days in town; I had not been in town for seventeen days.
