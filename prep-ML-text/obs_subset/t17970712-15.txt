I am an organ-builder : On Friday se'nnight last, between the hours of nine and ten, near ten o'clock, I was going, in company with a Mr. Hebbins that is here, on this side of Temple-bar , when a man pushed against me, and I felt his hand in my pocket; I turned round, and said, here is a rascal has picked my pocket, and I caught hold of his hands with the handkerchief, which was not quite out of my pocket, but hung about three parts out.
Gentlemen. Mr. Avery has been a little too quick; he had attempted to commit the offence, but had not compleated it.
