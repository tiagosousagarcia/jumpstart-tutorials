On the 6th of May the prisoner brought a load of hay into Carleton-house-yard ; he left thirty-five trusses, he ought to have left thirty-six; he took one truss with him, it belonged to me, I bought it for the prince of Wales.
Did you see him take it away
No.
I saw the load of hay the evening before.
How many trusses were there
Thirty-six. I sent the load of hay into the prince's stables. I never saw any more of the load of hay.
This lad, the prisoner, lived with you
. Yes, ever since the latter end of November; he is very sober and steady, he lived with me once before.
I saw thirty-five trusses delivered by Jackson into the prince of Wales's stables. I saw the thirty-sixth put down; there was only thirty five remaining, one went away in the cart, this man drove it; the prisoner drives a farmer's cart, his master's name is Willshin.
I know no more of it than following the cart. I saw a truss in the cart, the prisoner drove the cart; I saw the cart in Well-street, in the prisoner's way home.
