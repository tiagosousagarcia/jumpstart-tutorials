I am a boot and shoemaker , No. 17, Little New-street, Shoe-lane : On the 30th of September, about half past ten in the morning, the prisoner came into my shop while I was at work, and wished to give me a sum of money to finish teaching him the business; he had been an apprenetice to Mr. Allen, a gold beater in the same street; as soon as he was gone I missed a pair of shoes out of the window, I instantiy followed him and took him; I sent for a constable, and he was committed.
Did you see him take them?
No.
Did you see him do any thing near the window?
He stood with his back towards the window; I saw the costable take the shoes from his pocket; they have my mark upon them, besides my own workmanship; I know them to be my shoes.
Would you give 5s. for them?
Yes.
I found these shoes at the prosecutor's door.
