What time of the day was this?
Half past ten in the morning, the prisoner was there at the time, it was just at the time we were going to church, on Sunday, he came into the area gate, and down the steps, and opened the door, he was quite a stranger.
Did you see him come down?
No.
How do you know he was there at all
I was called to assist in securing of him, while he was in the house.
Did you find him in the laundry?
Yes.
What was become of your clothes when you went down to the laundry?
The laundry is below stairs, they were then laying on the floor.
Where were they before?
On the pegs, where they usually hang; I have got the clothes here, they are mine.
The prisoner came down the stairs, I did not see him, I heard him open the door and go into the laundry, I came out of my own room when I heard the area door open, coming along seeing the area door open, I looked into the laundry and there I saw the prisoner with the clothes on him, he had them first under his great coat, and when he saw me he slung them on the floor. These are the clothes.
I had been to Hammersmith that morning, as I was there, I got rather intoxicated with liquor, and coming home I met with a gentleman's servant, and he asked me if I would call in this street and enquire for one Mr. Edward's, a Butler, and I suppose I made a mistake of the place, and accordingly that gentleman came down and took me, and sent for a constable and searched me, and they found nothing at all about me; accordingly after that they took me to the watch-house, and they asked them whether they had lost any thing, and they said no; accordingly the constable of the watch-house said, they had better go home and see, but before that they said, they had lost some things at a time back, and that they would make me pay for the whole, and they went back and brought this bundle.
