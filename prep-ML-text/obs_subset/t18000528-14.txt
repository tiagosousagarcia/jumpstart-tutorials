I am servant to Mr. William Purdy , a broker , in Mark-lane ; On the 4th of November last, the property was taken away from the kitchen; I saw the articles there about eight o'clock in the morning; I saw the property, in a few minutes after, in the hands of Richard Cox , a fellow-servant of mine, in Tower-street; the great coat and articles are my property; they were delivered to the constable, who had them in his care till about a fortnight ago; I have had them since that time.
What is the coat worth?
Two pounds.
Would it sell for that?
No, it would not; it cost me more.
You must put some value upon it?
I will say a pound; I think the buckles would sell for twelve shillings; the constable has got Mr. Purdy's tea-spoon.
I am warehouseman to Mr. Purdy; On the 4th of November, I was in the warehouse, and saw the prisoner come out of my master's house with a great-coat on; I thought the coat did not belong to him, it was too long for him; I went up to him, followed him, and told him to take the coat from whence he took it; I followed him into Tower-street, and there a silver spoon dropped out of the pocket of the coat; I saw that the spoon was marked with my master's cypher, W. J. P.; he threw the coat off his back in the street, and begged me to let him go, but I brought him back to my master's yard, the buckles were in the coat-pocket; I sent for a constable, and he was taken to the Compter; this spoon has the same cypher upon it; I believe it is the same, the great-coat is the same, and the buckles I believe to be the same.
I am a constable, I received the property from Mr. Cox, in Mr. Purdy's kitchen; I afterwards delivered them up to Mr. Neale, and marked them.
I leave it to the mercy of the Court.
