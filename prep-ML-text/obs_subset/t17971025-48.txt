I am porter to the prosecutors; Three women came into the warehouse under pretence of begging charity, the prisoner was one of them; I suspected them, and followed them; the prisoner ran, and I overtook her in Blackwell-Hall-court, I never lost fight of her; I told her she had got a piece of print, but she said she had not; I felt, and found it under her petticoat.
Has the warehouse any communication with the dwelling-house?
There is a private staircase leads from the warehouse into Mr. Peele's house; I had seen the print about two hours before.
Does the warehouse belong to all the partners?
Yes; but they have nothing to do with the house except Edmund Peele. I saw the prisoner brought into the warehouse, and she dropped the calico.
I am a constable, (produces the calico) ; I received this from Mr. Saunders.
This is the calico, I know it by the pattern; I missed it upon her going away.
I met with two women, who asked me if I knew of an overseer; I told them I did not, I should be glad to get something if I could myself; and I went with them into this place, and was ashamed to ask, and so I turned out again; I do not know any thing of the calico.
