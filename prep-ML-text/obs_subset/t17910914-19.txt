I live in Exeter court, in the parish of St. Clements Danes ; I have known the prisoner some years past, she left her husband, I supported her, she did not lodge in my house, I fed her from the 16th of July to the 29th, I did not miss any thing during that time; I missed the watch an hour after she was gone, I laid the watch upon the table; as soon as I missed it I went after her directly, I found her in her lodgings in Bennet's-court, I begged her upon my knees to give me my watch, I told her no harm should come to her; she would not tell me where the watch was: her husband's name is John Sweet . My reason for putting it on the table was, she sat on the chair next to the place where I used to hang it up, so that induced me to lay it on the table.
This woman came to me and desired me to apprehend the prisoner; I did so, and searched her, and found the duplicate of the watch.
I live with Mr. Moulds, I saw the prisoner at our house on the 29th of July, at seven o'clock in the evening, she pledged a watch, I lent her half a guinea on it.
It was left me about eight years ago by my sister-in-law.
