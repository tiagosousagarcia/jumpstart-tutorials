I am a baker , and live in Church-street, Hackney: On the 16th of January, I went in to serve the White Horse, in the Grove, Hackney ; I left my basket upon a large block of stone in a stone-mason's yard, as high as my head; before the people of the house had time to pay me, I heard an alarm; I went out, and saw the prisoner, and a man with him, running as fast as they could, the prisoner had a loaf under each arm; I kept sight of him till I caught him, before I overtook him he dropped the bread; I stopped and looked at the bread, and found it was mine; I brought him back, and took him to Worship-street; I mark my bread with a particular large W, different from all other bakers in London.
I live next door to the White Horse: On the 16th of January, I saw the prisoner, with two other boys, and a man, lurking about in the neighbourhood; the prisoner and the man went into the stone-mason's yard, the man put his hand into the baker's basket, took out a quartern loaf, and give it to the prisoner; I then saw the man put his hand in again, but did not see whether he took out another loaf or not; I then told the baker what I had seen, he immediately went after them, and I saw the prisoner brought back in the custody of the baker.
I was almost starving, and seeing this bread, I took it.
