I live at Ealing , and lost thirteen geese on Friday, I saw them last about half past one; on Monday following I saw them in possession of Cridland; I had one of them for thirteen years.
I am servant to Mr. Battye, and saw the geese on Friday; I saw them at Cridland's, and know them to be my master's.
I know the prisoner by apprehending him; I was going on my duty on the 4th of November towards Kensington Gravel-pits, about eight o'clock in the evening, and saw him on the road with a little girl and thirteen geese before him; I asked him where he brought them from; he said, from Henley-upon-Thames; I asked him where he was going to; he said, to his brother, a poulterer, in the Haymarket; I told him to go on, and followed him up as far as Tyburn-turnpike. Instead of turning the way to the Haymarket, he went through Cumberland-street; I followed him through different streets, and then I took him and the geese to the watch-house; I found Mr. Battye, and be owned the geese in the watch-house; the prisoner said, forgive me, for God's sake, for I bought them of a man and woman coming along the road.
