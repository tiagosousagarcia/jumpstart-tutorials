I am a cheesemonger , in Great Tower-street; I know nothing of the loss of the firkin of butter, it was lost out of a cart, between Tooley-street and Tower-street , on the 15th of this month, between six and seven in the evening; my servant, William Church, went to the wharf for 13 firkins of butter, 12 firkins of York butter, and I cask of Cork butter; there were 2 firkins lost; 1 of York, and the cask of Irish butter.
I am servant to Mr. Hartshorn: I drove the cart, and took up the butter at Beale's wharf, 13 firkins of butter; 12 firkins of York, and 1 firkin of Irish; I lost 2 firkins out of the cart, that is all I know; they were marked J.H. upon the side of the York, and the other marked with heart H.
I am an officer, belonging to Lambeth-street, Whitechapel: On Saturday, the 15th of this month, in company with Dawson, I apprehended the prisoner, in King-street, Tower-hill; he had this firkin of butter upon his head, (producing it) it was about seven in the evening; I saw him going into a shop that was a notorious shop for receiving stolen goods; the man of the shop was standing at the door, and I believe had seen me; and he would not let him come in; I then apprehended him, having no doubt it was stolen property; I asked him where he brought it from, and he said, from Newgate-street, he was going to carry it to Mr. Wilson, in Ratcliffe-highway; I asked him if he had no bill of parcel or direction, and not producing any, I had no doubt it was stolen property; I went among the butter merchants, and found, it out by the mark.
This is my sirkin, it has my own mark upon it; it had been missing some time at the wharf; the other sirkin I never found.
I had been carrying a load for a gentleman in the market, and going towards home a gentleman stood by the corner of Magpye-alley, in Newgate-street, with this rub; and he said, porter, do you want a load, I told him, yes; says he, you have got to carry this to Ratcliff-highway; he told me he would give me eighteen pence; I asked him for a note, and he said I had no occasion for a note, for, says he, I shall walk along with you; and coming along Cheapside, I saw him close behind me, and I saw him behind me in the Minories; and when I came to cross the way on Tower-hill, this gentleman came up to me, and asked me where I was going; I told him I was going to Mr. Wilson's, in Ratcliff-highway; and I looked about for the gentleman, and he was gone: I have worked fourteen years about the market and the water-side, and nobody could ever give me a bad character.
