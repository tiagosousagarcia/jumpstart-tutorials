I am a partner with Jacob Warner ; I know nothing of the circumstance.
I am a servant to Mr. Warner; on Wednesday the 24th of this month, I found the prisoner at the bar, concealed in a sugar hogshead, up one pair of stairs, in Mr. Warner's warehouse; he had a bag, which was under him I believe, it did not appear like ours.
You did not see him fill it?
I did not; this was a linen bag, and we always use paper ones; I desired one of my fellow servants to call up Mr. Warner; and he was taken to the watch-house.
I went up for a bit of sugar to eat, and hearing the gentleman come up, I was so frightened, I got into the cask.
