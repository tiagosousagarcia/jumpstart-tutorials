I am the wife of Thomas Noble; I live in Three Cups-alley, in the parish of Shadwell ; my husband is a tailor ; the prisoner lodged in the two pair of stairs room; he had a room to himself; he took possession of it on the 16th of November, in the afternoon, and came again at nine o'clock in the evening; I went up stairs, put the sheets upon the bed, and left Mrs. Macdonald in bed in the room, where he sat down; I put a pair of sheets, a linen pillow-case, and a cotton counterpane on the bed; when I came down stairs from sheeting the bed, he asked me what bolts I had to the door; I told him I had two bolts, and a spring-lock; I lit him up stairs to bed, and fastened the bolts, and locked the door; the next morning, between four and five, I heard him go out at the street-door; I immediately got up, and went up stairs, and missed the sheets, the pillow-case, and th counterpane; the blankers were left: on the Sunday week following, I saw the prisoner again at a cook's shop, at the end of the alley where I live; I went in, and charged him with stealing the things; he gave me a great shove in the breast, and ran away; a labouring man that lives close by, stopped him; I fetched an officer, and gave charge of him; my husband is at Memel.
I was in bed when the prisoner came in; Mrs. Noble told him the door had two bolts and a spring-lock; that is all I know of it.
I am an officer of the Police-office, Shadwell; Riley, and I, took charge of the prisoner on the 24th of last month; Mrs. Noble identified him among thirty people; the property has not been found; I found upon him five shillings, and a duplicate for a coat and waistcoat.
I know nothing at all of it.
(To Mrs. Noble). How long had the prisoner lodged with you?
Only that night.
