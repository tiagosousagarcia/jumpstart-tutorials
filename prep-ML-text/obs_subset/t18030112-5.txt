I am a lighterman; I lost a sack containing four bushels of wheat, from the bow of the barge, about half past six in the evening of the 13th of December; we went on shore to get some beer, we were gone about a quarter of an hour, and when we came back, I saw a boat athwart the bow of the barge, and the prisoner and another were in it, the others got away; I found the sack in the boat; we immediately hauled the boat along side our craft with a hitcher, and they said directly, overboard with it, I suppose twenty times; the other man jumped over-board and swam away; the sack was thrown over-board, we got it up again afterwards, (produces the sack) it is my master's property; his name is John-Shepperd Killick; the sack contained four bushels of wheat.
I believe maltsters, and persons dealing in corn, frequently lend their sacks?
Yes, they do.
The prisoner was not the person who ran away?
No, he threw the sack over board.
Did you leave any body on board when you went ashore?
Yes, a lad.
Whether he gave any direction to the prisoner or the other man, you don't know?
No.
Is he here?
No.
I was at work with the last witness; when we returned, I saw a boat lying athwart the bow of our barge, I laid hold of it with the boat-hook; the barge laid off St. Catherine's stairs; as soon as I laid hold of it, they cried out, heave it overboard, which the prisoner immediately did; the other man jumped into the water, and swam away. I laid hold of the prisoner, and brought him into the barge.
Did the prisoner attempt to make his escape?
No; he wanted us to let him go.
I had a fare, a man desired me to row to that barge, which I did, and he took the sack into the boat; when this man came and pulled the boat back again, the man then jumped over board, and swam away; I could have done the same, if I had been guilty.
