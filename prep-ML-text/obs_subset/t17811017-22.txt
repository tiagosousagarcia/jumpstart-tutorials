I lodge at Mr. Read's, the grinder's, in Exeter-street . I went out to work, on Friday the 3d of August: I left the other lodger, Margaret Tool , in the room. When I returned, between four and five o'clock, to tea, I missed all the things mentioned in the indictment (repeating them) out of my box. The next morning, I met the prisoner with them. She said, she only borrowed them; but if I would lend her some money, to fetch her old gown and petticoat out of pawn, she would return all my things.
Had she asked you to borrow them of you?
No: I should never have lent her them, if she had. She ran away from me, and was taken again last Monday week; but nothing was found upon her.
I was in the room when the prosecutrix went out. The prisoner came about half after eight. I went out about half after twelve, and left the prisoner in the room. I thought, as she used the place, she might be trusted in it. I returned about three, and the landlady gave me the key. The prisoner was gone. I met her with the prosecutrix the next morning. She had all the things on. She said, if she would get her things out of pawn, she would deliver her things to her.
I came up to the room. I had lost my cloak. The prosecutrix offered to lend me a cloak, to go after a place. I was not at the house afterwards for two or three days. I know nothing of it.
