How long had she been in your house?
About two months before this happened. I stayed out rather latish one night about ten o'clock, and my wife was along with me, and she took it off the bed, when I went home my little child cried, and said Kit had taken the blanket away from the bed, and gone.
Had you left her in the house?
My wife did, I had been out all day.
What time did you return?
Ten o'clock at night, as near as I can guess.
Do you know of your own knowledge whether any blanket was missing on the bed?
Yes, there was.
Had you more than one blanket on it?
No, only one.
When did you next see the prisoner?
I sent out after her directly, and I heard by the watchman that she was gone down the road with the bundle under her arm; I set out after her between ten and eleven, I did not overtake her at all, I heard at Islington that they had taken her on suspicion, and had got her into the cage, and there I found her, the constable of the night had got the blanket, I saw it there at the watch-house.
I know it is my blanket, I have no marks on it, I can swear to it, it is a very good one.
Is the prisoner any relation of your's?
No, she made an abode there because she was out of work, and I let her lodge with my children out of pity; she continued with me a short time about two months.
I was very much distressed, and one and another snapped on me and I
was going away, but I own it is the gentleman's blanket.
