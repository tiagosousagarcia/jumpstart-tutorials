- I am a labouring man , as well as the prisoner; we lodged and slept together: Last Monday week, in the afternoon, I missed the articles which I had seen in the morning; I saw them again in Ruffell-street, when the prisoner was taken the same evening; I never lent them to the prisoner, or did I owe him any thing.
Did you not lend me a stick the Saturday before?
Yes.
- I am a journeyman carpenter: I was going home to Stoke Newington; I saw the prisoner on the road with the cloaths in a bundle, on a stick over his shoulder, coming from Stoke Newington to London, between seven and eight in the evening; his master rode after him, and gave charge; I stopped him, and he threw the bundle into a ditch; the prisoner rather denied it when his master charged him with the robbery; he said, no, sir, they are not his things, and dropped them; I picked them up, and the watchman and I took him to the Office; he had the prosecutor's hat on.(The property produced and identified.)
I went out and got drunk; he owed me money, and I took the things for it.
