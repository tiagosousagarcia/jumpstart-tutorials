I am servant to Mr. Frere, in New-street, Spring-gardens: On Monday morning, the 25th of October, the prisoner came to work about six o'clock in the morning; I looked out at the window, and saw him go out soon after with two saws; he is a carpenter.
I am a carpenter; the prisoner lodged with me; he was in very great distress when he came to me; I received information of the saws being stolen, and I directed them where to find him. - (The saws identified by the prosecutor.)
