I live with Mr. Churchill, hosier , Oxford street . On Tuesday the 13th of January the prisoner came into the shop, she said she wanted to purchase some silk stockings, she looked out six pair and desired a bill to be made of them; she left the shop without purchasing, but said she would call again for what she had purchased; I put the six pair of stockings on the further end of the counter.
Did you miss any articles.
I cannot say that I did.
You are a hosier in Oxford street.
I am.
Do you recollect any thing of the prisoner at the bar coming into your shop on Tuesday the 13th instant.
Yes, about twelve o'clock. In consequence of my suspecting that she had taken a pair of stockings from me I took her into the parlour.
Was any search made.
Not in the first instance; I was called to the shop by other customers in my shop; while I was there my wife came and said here is some more stockings.
You did not find them, is your wife here.
No, it is impossible for us both to be here without shutting up the shop.
