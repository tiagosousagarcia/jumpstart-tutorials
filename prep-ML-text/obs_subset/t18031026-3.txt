The prisoner is my porter : I am a grocer in Lombard-street , my warehouse is in Clement's-lane; the prisoner had lived with me near three years.
I am servant to Mr. Greenfield: On Monday the 19th of September, a little after eight o'clock in the morning, I opened the window, and saw the prisoner go down Clement's-lane with a basket, and I told one of the men of it.
I am a victualler, I keep the Nag's-head in Red Lion-court, Clement's-lane: The prisoner came to me between eight and nine o'clock in the morning, and desired to leave a parcel for a little time, it was a basket; about half an hour after that Mr. Greenfield's shopman came to me, and I shewed him the basket the prisoner had left; he went away, and his master came and looked at it, and I delivered it to him.
Did you not say before the Lord-Mayor, you could not tell whether he was the man or not?
I said I believed he was the man, but I could not swear to him; nor can I now.
Have you any doubt about his being the person?
I cannot swear positively; I was busy at the time he brought it in.
How soon afterwards did you see him?
About three quarters of an hour.
Had you then any doubt about his being the person?
I had.
How far did he live from you?
About two hundred yards.
I am a constable; I was sent for to take charge of the prisoner and the basket.
Have you not trusted the prisoner with thousands of pounds?
Yes.
And he always behaved honestly?
Yes.
I am innocent of the charge.
