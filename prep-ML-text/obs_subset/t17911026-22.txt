My house is in Aldersgate-street , opposite Little Britain; I came home about nine last Saturday evening; I found my two pair of stairs front room on fire. The prisoner was my servant ; I suspected her of stealing several things. I had her taken up as soon as I had put the fire out. She was going to bed; I found in one of her shoes fourteen duplicates; her bed-room is one pair of stairs above the room that was on fire. I found many of my things upon examining at the pawnbroker's.
I am an apprentice; I know the prisoner; she pledged a pair of breeches with me the 7th of September, a pair of stockings for 9 d. the 20th of September; the breeches are velveteen, the stockings are worsted; a coat for 6 s. 2 d. the 24th of September, and two waistcoats for 6 s.
I never gave the prisoner leave to pawn any thing for me.
I have mended my father's stockings; those stockings are mine.
I have had the coat twelve months; I am sure it is mine.
I leave myself to the mercy of the Jury.
