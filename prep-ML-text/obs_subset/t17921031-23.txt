I am a farmer in the New Road, St. Pancras. I lost a truss of hay on Wednesday, the 24th of last month; it was lost out of my loft.
I am a milk-carrier. I was going to Mr. Mortimer's house, and the prisoner was behind me; he went away, and presently he came out with a truss of hay on his back; I followed him and took it off his back, and stopped him, and brought him back to Mr. Mortimer's yard; it was past nine in the evening: he said the hay was his own.
I am a servant to Mr. Mortimer; I packed the hay, and know this hay belongs to Mortimer; the cutting and colour of the hay; and the bands, I know, and the twisting, it came from a rick that heated, and there was a mouldy place.
I am a watchman: Kelley told me that a man had got a truss of hay; and I followed him and took him with the hay, which hay I delivered to Mr. Mortimer.
