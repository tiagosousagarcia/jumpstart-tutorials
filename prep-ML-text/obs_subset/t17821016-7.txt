The prisoner lodged with me, he paid my wife some rent, and pulled out some money more than she thought he could come by honestly; she said that boy has been robbing some body; I hope it is not our money. I went up stairs and looked in my box, which was hid in my bed-chamber, at the head of my bed; there were half-guineas and guineas, to the\\ amountof twenty-two guineas.
When had you counted the money in it before?
About eight days before, I missed it on the 22d of September, about one o'clock.
Was the box locked?
No.
Where was it hid?
it was up behind the bed in a corner.
Who knew where that box was hid?
Nobody but my wife. The prisoner did not come home all night, the next morning I apprehended him at his master's shop; he owned he had robbed me, and that he had given a man a guinea, and eleven half-crowns; he said he took it, but not quite so much, he would not say the exact sum; I did not ask him where he took it from; he said he took it from me, he owned to about six guineas and an half.
What did you say to him to induce him to tell you this?
I charged him with it, and he said he did take it, and he hoped I would forgive him. I told him I must have him before a magistrate; I made him no promise at all: I apprehend he went in the day time, as my wife is hard of hearing, and searched the room. He did not tell me how he took it.
The lad came to me for a watch on the 18th of September, I am a watch-maker; I had never a one by me that would do for him; I told him I would get him one in a few days, and he deposited the money in my hands, two guineas and a half.
Did not you wonder how the lad came by two guineas and a half?
No Sir, I knew where he worked.
I was sent for a marine and I was not accepted of; then they took me up again, my Lord.
