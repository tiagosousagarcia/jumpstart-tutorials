I am clerk to Messrs. Richard Jones , William Taylor, and Peter Maizeaux. On the 13th of September the prisoner was going from the factory to dinner, Mr. Jones desired me to stop him; he them went into the room where he had been at work; I took him to Mr. Jones, and there was a dozen saucepan-handles in his bosom, and another dozen in his right-hand pocket; he did not say any thing: a constable was sent for, and the things delivered up, and he was committed.
I am servant to the prosecutors; I made these handles for the prosecutors; when I was at the Brown Bear, Bow-street, he was there; says he, I did not know whether they were tin or pewter; he said he took them for the support of his family.
It was distress that made me take them.
What did he earn?
He could earn at least 25s. a week, if he had been diligent, which he was not: he had been with us about four months.
