I am servant to Thomas Crookenton , 21, Manchester-square ; I had left the knives and the forks in the area, in the tray, between ten and eleven o'clock in the morning; I was in the stable; the kitchen maid informed me a woman had taken them away; I immediately left the stable and I saw the prisoner with the knife tray under her arm; she was brought back to the area when I saw her.
I am waiter in Marybone-lane. On the 4th of May, about two o'clock in the afternoon, I saw the prisoner in Duke-street, Manchester-square; I followed her; in about a minute or two I missed her, and in the course of five minutes she appeared again; she had the knife tray under her arm and the knives in it; I stopped her, she was about fifty yards from Spanish-place; I asked her what she had got there; she said her mistress's knives and forks, she lived in Lincoln's-inn-fields; I told her I would find her mistress; I took her to Mrs. Crookenton's house, and they were claimed by some of the people.
I was coming across the square I met a woman that I had carried milk for her sometime back; she gave me this tray of knives and forks; she told me to go to the bottom of the square; I expected her back in a minute; this man asked me what I had; I told him; I never went down the area till he took me down; the cook took me into the kitchen and took them from me.
Is this woman here
No; her name is King; I have not seen her since I have been here.
