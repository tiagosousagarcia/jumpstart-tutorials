I am a farmer at Shepherd's-bush ; I look after a farm for Mr. Gomm, I am his bailiff ; this lamb is my property; I lost him the 28th; he was put in the over night, into the farm-yard; it was a ram lamb with a dam; I missed it next morning about half after five, I could not find it; I received information of it, and went to the gravel-pits, and found the lamb; the prisoner was in the round-house; the constable's name is Hale. I knew the lamb by the slit ear-mark in the off-ear, and a forked purse.
I am constable of Kensington. I stopped the prisoner with the lamb: he said he found it, and was going to sell it. I put him into the round-house. Mr. Goff described the lamb before he saw it.
