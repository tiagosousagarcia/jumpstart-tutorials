I am a coach-master ; I lost the property out of two coach-houses, Brompton-row , it is part of my yard, which locks up. From information I received from Brampton, I laid in wait all night; the prisoner was gone to Hertford, to the election, he did not return till one o'clock in the morning, and when I went to look for this glass in the morning it was broke; I could not find the frame; I wanted a glass-coach pulled out to go to Marybone, I called the prisoner to help out the coach, the glass frames were gone; I said, this must be done by a thief in my own place; the men said, I would have a search-warrant, master, and search all our premises; I went to the prisoner, and said to him, shew me where this frame is; he said, he did not know where it was; I said, I will pull every stick and every stone up in the place but I will find it; finding some of the glass under the rack-board, I then said the frame is not far; one of my coachmen found it, and gave it to me.
How do you know the prisoner had any thing to do with it?
It is the same glass that one of my men was to take to the High-ground for him to sell.
I am a hackney-coachman, I work for Mr. Ede: On the 11th of February, the prisoner was going out of the yard with a chaise, he drove post-chaises and glass-coaches for Mr. Ede; he put his glass in my coach that I drove, he shewed it to me, he wanted me to take it to town.
I am an officer belonging to Marlborough-street; I apprehended the prisoner on the 12th at Mr. Ede's yard, Great Brompton, I produce the glass; after this glass was found, the prisoner called me on one side, and says he, if I tell you the truth, do you think it would be the means of stopping my punishment; I told him it might be.
I am innocent.
The prisoner informed me that he had taken them, on the night after he was taken.
