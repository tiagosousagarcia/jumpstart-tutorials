I live with Mr. William Wrathall of Snow-hill , plate worker ; on the 13th of October, the prisoner at the bar was sent by his master to erect some building in the warehouse adjoining to the premises of Mr. Wrathall, which he completed on the 25th, and at half past five o'clock Charles Crowden brought some bottoms of candlesticks, and asked if they belonged to Mr. Wrathall, which he immediately acknowledged; he said he had been at a publick house called the Sailor's Last Shift, and a carpenter came in and enquired for a bag of tools; the prisoner having something under his coat, and of a suspicious appearance, they suspected it to be a pot, and desired him to unbutton, upon which the article now in my hand fell from under his coat; I went to the publick house and had the prisoner committed to the Compter; the prisoner lodged at No. 8, in a court in Shoe-lane, there we found the articles mentioned in the indictment, and sundry others; there was a metal candlestick, and the bottoms of some other candlesticks, this is the piece I received from Mr. Crowden.
I am a tin plate worker; I was at the Sailor's Last Shift about four o'clock, it is in Poppin's-court, it was the 25th of October; the prisoner came in and asked for a bag of tools, and something appeared under his coat, and a young fellow pulled his coat open and these things dropped from it; this is what they call block tin, it is the bottom of a candlestick; I told him he could not have made it himself, he said he found it among a parcel of things in Shoreditch; in the mean time Mr. Millington went and fetched a constable, and the prisoner was taken into custody.
I am a constable, I was sent for to the Sailor's Last Shift on the 25th of October; I took the prisoner into custody, and took him to the Compter.
I bought these things of the prosecutor's clerk.
