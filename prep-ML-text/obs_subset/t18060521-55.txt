You are a publican .
Yes, I live at the Black Boy and Horshoe, Nicholas-lane, Lombard-street .
Have you lost any pots lately.
About nine dozen.
I live along with my father, he keeps the Mail Coach public house, Abchurch lane. On the 29th of April, between seven and eight in the morning, I saw the prisoner at the bar in possession of three pewter pots; I asked him where he lived, he said he lived with Mr. Birch, who keeps the Black Boy and Horshoe, Nicholas lane; I went home immediately to my father and told him, he told me to go and ask Mr. Birch, I did, Mr. Birch said there was no such a person lived with him; the next morning Mr. Birch's waiter found him in Abchurch-lane.
When you saw the pots in the prisoner's possession did you see whose they were.
Yes, I saw J. Birch, Blackboy and Horshoe, Nicholas-lane, Lombard-street, upon them.
You are sure you saw him with the pots.
Yes, and he said that he lived with Mr. Birch.
Which way was I going.
When I saw you with the pots you was going towards Mr. Birch's.
Examined by Mr. Alley. I am servant with alderman Curtis, at the banking house, Lombard-street.
On the 29th of April did you see the prisoner at the bar.
Yes, he called at our house for the pots, he said that he came from Mr. Birch's, it was just before eight in the morning.
You considered him as the regular servant.
He went into the servant's hall and took the pots away.
I was not in the house at all at that time.
(to prosecutor) Was the prisoner a servant of yours.
He was not.
Where are the pots.
We never had them, I had lost pots on that day.
Do you serve sir William Curtis in Lombard-street.
Yes.
I never was in that place at all, nor never received any pots, nor nothing of the kind.
