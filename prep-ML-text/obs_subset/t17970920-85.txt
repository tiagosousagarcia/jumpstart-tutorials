I live at No. 33, Warwick-lane; I am a servant out of place, I went to lodge with the prisoner's mother about a fortnight before the 4th of August, at No. 2, Garter-court, Barbican ; during the time I lived there, the prisoner lived at home with her mother; her husband was away; I left my lodgings a little after three on the 4th of August; I left the prisoner at home in the room alone; I returned again about seven in the evening; I went to my box, and found the lock was open; it had not been broke, but had been opened; I left it locked; I missed the things mentioned in the indictment; I found nobody in the room at all; the prisoner was gone out; I waited a little while, and finding she did not come in, I went to her mother, and, by her directions, found the prisoner in the evening in St. Catherine's, by the water side; she had one cap, one shawl, and a piece of cotton belonging to me upon her; I desired the watchman to take charge of her, and he took her to the watch-house; I waited till the officer of the night came, and he took the things of me; the constable has them; the next morning I went to attend at the Public-office, Lambeth-street, and the prisoner there said, my marcella petticoat was pledged at Mr. Matthews's, in the Minories; she said, she did not know any thing of the rest of the things; I went to the pawnbroker's for the petticoat, and there I saw a gown of my property which he has; I have not found any of my other things; the pawnbroker and constable are neither of them here.
