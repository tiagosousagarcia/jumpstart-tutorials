On the 2d of February, at twenty minutes before eight o'clock, I had hung up five legs of mutton, and some pieces of beef; I lost a leg of mutton.
I am a carpenter; I live next door to Borritt; I saw the prisoner and two others; the prisoner at the bar stopped; then they came by my house, and went back; and the prisoner took the leg of mutton off the hook; he put it under his coat; I went and asked Borritt's servant if he saw the man take the mutton; I took the prisoner; he went into a passage, and there he left the mutton, and came out without it; before the mutton was brought out, he said he knew nothing of it: the prisoner said, Bl - st you, or d - n you, if you do not let me go, I will cut your bloody head off.
Did you see me go into the passage?
I did not.
I am a butcher: on the 2d of February, I was coming from Islington; I saw a leg of mutton in the passage; it is a passage from St. John's-street to Northampton-street: the prisoner denied any knowledge of the mutton.
I saw Smith there; it was about eight o'clock.
I was coming through this passage, and they said they had lost a leg of mutton, and Mr. Phillips said I had taken it.
I picked up this mutton in George-alley, and delivered it to Borritt's boy; I saw the leg of mutton near the place where they make water; the prisoner was fourteen yards from the place where the mutton was found: I advised them to let the prisoner go, as the property was found, and he had lost sight of the prisoner.
