I can only prove the property.
I am one of the Bow-street patrole: I stopped the prisoner on the 10th of September, between twelve and one, at night, with a bundle; I asked him who it belonged to, he said, it belonged to his father, who lived about twenty yards from where I stopped him; I went with him to his father's door, and there he dropped the bundle, and ran away; his father lived up two pair of stairs, in a back room; I pursued the prisoner, and the watchman picked up the bundle; he ran near a quarter of a mile before he was stopped; I never lost sight of him, but in turning the corners; I am sure he is the same person.
I am a watchman: I picked up the bundle. (Produces it).
This is the same bundle.
I am a watchman: About half past twelve, on the 10th, I was going round Charles-street, Manchaster-square; I heard the rattles go, and saw the prisoner running; he ran up against me without shoes; he got past me, and I sprang my rattle; he turned back, and said he would throw himself upon my mercy.
I lodge in Kallihar's house: On the 10th of September, about twelve o'clock at night, I took the prisoner to my lodging; he was not in my room above a minute, and then we both went out together; I left him at the end of the court; I was not gone about six minutes; when I came back, the room-door was open, and the things gone.
These are my husband's property.
Mary Clarke ran after me in Oxford-road, she had some more girls with her; she wanted me to give her something to drink, and, in order to get rid of her, I gave her something to drink; I missed one shilling out of my pocket, and I told her, I must have it; I threatened to charge the watch with her, and she said, if I would go home with her, she would let me have it; I went home with her, and she wanted me to stop with her all night; then she would not let me have it, and, I said, I would take something out of the room for it, and I took these things.
