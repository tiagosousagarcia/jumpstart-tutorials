I found this coat at Mr. Tomlinson's the Wednesday following, the Black Horse, in Curtain-road, and I have had it ever since.
Do you know any thing of the prisoner?
No, I do not.
This is my coat.
I saw the prisoner near my father's stable, he went through the ground to the Tenter Ground, behind the stable, he had a bundle under his arm, which I saw the slap of a coat hanging out, which when I heard that William Bellingham had lost a coat, I thought that he was the man that had taken it. Then I informed Bellingham of what I had seen.
Did you know the man?
Yes, the prisoner is the man.
I make my board at the Black Horse, in Curtain-road. On Sunday evening the prisoner came with this coat, and he asked me to take care of it for him; I told him I had no conveniency, he had better leave it in care of the house, but he delivered it into my hands, the same time I delivered it to the servant maid of the house, and she put it somewhere; this passed on, on Monday evening I heard that there was a coat lost, and it struck me that this was the coat, and I went and told the hostler.
I did not know any thing about the coat when they accused me of
it. On Monday morning I was very much intoxicated with liquor, I had worn the hostler's coats before many times, they found the coat after I was in prison. I came out of Cambridgeshire to go to work.
What do you know of this man?
He was only with us about three months. I know nothing farther of the man, he came to attend the bait horses, and get them ready to go out at the call. I know nothing of the man, I knew nothing against him.
