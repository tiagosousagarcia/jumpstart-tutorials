I am wife of Hugh Macpherson , I lost the things in the indictment, on the 3d of Sept. the parlour door was open, I went for a bason of water, and coming back, I found the prisoner in the house, running away with the property; he was stopped in two minutes; I saw the things taken from him.
I was going into Bread-street, and heard the cry of stop thief! the prisoner was running, I stopped him, I saw him heave the cloak into a house; to the best of my knowledge, this is the cloak; it is the same I gave to Mrs. Macpherson.
It is the same.
Please your honor there was crying stop thief! I saw a young man running in a blue jacket, I ran the same as another, he threw something over my head, and I stooped down on my knee, and they took me.
