I am a coachman to Mrs. Gibson, in Hertford-street, May-fair; I lost the things mentioned in the indictment; I went out of town and returned the 2d of October; when I came to town the things were missing; I had left them in a box locked up at the Chesterfield arms; some of the things were found at the pawnbroker's.
The prisoner lodged in the same house with me; I wash for him; he asked me to wash these two shirts; I did not wash them; then he asked me to pawn them; I put frills on them, and pawned them at Mr. Moore's.
My husband is a brewer's servant; I pawned a pair of breeches for the prisoner about five weeks ago, for five shillings; I have known the prisoner some years.
I am a pawnbroker; I produce two shirts.
I bought a waistcoat of him for half a crown; this is it.
I found the other waistcoat in Ball's room, and a very large bunch of keys fit for a bureau; I am a patrol.
These shirts are mine; when I lost them they had no frills; I know the waistcoats, they are mine; I left my two boxes in the club-room, I lost things out of one box only.
I bought the two shirts of James Point ; Mrs. Gard bought two shirts at the same time; Mrs. Berry bought a waistcoat and breeches; I never saw the Chesterfield arms, nor do I know where it is.
I bought the waistcoat of Isaac Ball .
I bought the breeches of Isaac Ball .
