I am a stay-maker . The prisoner came to my shop on the 27th of February last. I was called down stairs: my wife was run out in pursuit of the prisoner; she and some of the neighbours brought the prisoner back to my shop. I searched her myself; I found a piece of ribband under her arm, and another in her bosom: the black ribband is my property, and the yellow one is not.
I am a millener. The prisoner and another woman came into my shop on the 27th of February, under pretence of buying ribbands: while she was looking at the ribband, some other people came in; I served them, and turned again to the prisoner; they both staid in the shop about ten minutes. When they were got about two doors, I missed the ribbands; I called my husband down, and ran after the prisoner; I overtook her in a passage facing the Five Bells Tavern: my shop is at the end of the New Church in the Strand. I got up with the other woman, but she struck me on the breast, and got away: I got assistance, and brought the prisoner back; I saw her searched, and the two pieces of ribband taken from her.
What is that piece of black ribband worth?
About nine shillings.
The other young woman asked me to go along with her to buy a yard of ribband; I went into this shop with her; the lady and she could not agree: when we came out, and had got a few yards, the lady called out she had been robbed; the young woman put these pieces of ribband into my hand; I did not know where she got them.
