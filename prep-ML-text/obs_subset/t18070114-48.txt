I am a cheesemonger , I live in King street, St. James's. On the 14th instant, about eight o'clock in the morning, I bought two pigs at Newgate market , and I saw them taken out of my cart by a man in company with the prisoner, I saw that person put it on the prisoner's shoulder. I took hold of him, and he threw the pork down. I secured the prisoner.
What is become of the man that put the pork on the prisoner's shoulder.
He run away.
The pork that you bought is the same that was taken out of the cart.
It was.
I was employed to carry some pork down in the street, and the gentleman said he would give me sixpence for carrying it.
