I am a bricklayer , No. 81. Drury-lane ; the prisoner at the bar used to come backwards and forwards to her sister-in-law, and on the 16th of April, I saw the coat in a drawer, I went out and left it there about an hour, before I missed it the prisoner came to the house between four and five o'clock.
I am a pawnbroker, in the Strand: On the 16th of April, between eight and ten in the evening, the prisoner brought a coat and pledged it with me, I am sure the prisoner is the person, (produces it;) I sent her six shillings and sixpence upon it.
This is my coat, here is a place where it has been fine drawn.
A sister-in-law of mine gave me the coat to pledge, I did not know it was stolen.
