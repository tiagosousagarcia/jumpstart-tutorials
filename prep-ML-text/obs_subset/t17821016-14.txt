On Saturday the 28th of September last, between the hours of eleven and twelve at night, I was going home through the King's Road, opposite John-street , the prisoner stopped me, and demanded my watch and money; he repeated his demand; I said, no, and stepped back: he drew a large knife upon me, which I seized, and knocked him down. I called for assistance, and had him taken to the watch-house; I took the knife from him, and gave it to the officer of the night, the constable has got the knife: two small knives were found upon him; he at first appeared to be sober, but afterwards he seemed in liquor.
Prisoner's counsel. Where do you live?
I live at the corner of Dyott-street, Saint Giles's; I am a carpenter ; I wrenched the knife out of his hand by the blade, it was bent by the twist; the prisoner struggled to get away.
I am a constable. The knife was given to me in the watch-house.
Prisoner's counsel. Did the prisoner appear in liquor?
Yes.
I am a watchman. The prosecutor, Mr. Hughes, had the prisoner by the collar in one hand, and the knife in the other; Mr. Hughes called watch, and said the prisoner demanded his watch and his money; the prisoner denied knowing any thing about the knife, and he did not make any charge against the prosecutor.
Do you know which called watch?
I think Hughes.
Was the prisoner drunk?
He did not appear drunk.
Which gave the charge?
Hughes.
Hughes knocked me down, and kicked me; I called watch several times.
