Is the pawnbroker here?
He is not, I have his note on the waistcoat, I found the duplicate in the prisoner's pocket, and one of my witnesses went to the pawnbroker's, and found the waistcoats there; the prisoner denied the whole.
On the 20th of February, the prisoner came to my house to ask for a lodging, in the name of Gilbert, I enquired his character, and found it a very good one, I took him in on the Sunday evening, he came in at Ten o'clock, I let him into the room, the prosecutor slept out that night, and the Saturday night, the prisoner went out on the Monday morning; I saw the sheets off the bed, and I entered the room with a ladder, and I saw the prosecutor's box broke open, and the cover split in two, then I informed the prosecutor, I went to the place where he had directed me for the prisoner, and I found a person that answered the name, and was very much like him, but was not him, we very soon after took the prisoner, and the key of my room was found in his pocket, and a duplicate was found, which led to the discovery of the waistcoats.
I went for the waistcoats, the pawnbroker has got the duplicate, and has sent his note in writing.
I never saw the property till I see it now, and at the Justices before; the duplicate I had in my pocket, was a duplicate of two waistcoats, which I bought of a young man that is gone into the country, they were white waistcoats, and they went and brought these two striped waistcoats; I have no proof of it, because he is in the country, the landlord and I had a falling out, and he wanted three shillings for some misdemeanor in soiling the room, and insisted that I should go out at that hour of the night, on Sunday night; so I went away on Monday.
But you know it was not necessary for you take the key with you?
I forgot the key, I have no friends, I have been here starving these two months.
