I saw the prisoner come into the shop, when I was behind the counter; he reached down these cups and saucers from a shelf and ran away with them, directly I called out to a German; he followed him, and brought him back. I took these cups and saucers from him.
I stopped the prisoner and saw the cups taken from him.
I put the cups and saucers upon the shop-board, till the constable came, and then I delivered them to him.
A man asked me to take this china up the street, I do not know the name of the street, and I was to leave them at the alehouse till he came.
