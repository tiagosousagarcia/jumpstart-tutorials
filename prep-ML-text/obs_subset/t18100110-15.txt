I am a cabinet maker , No. 8, Sun-street : I was not at home when the glass was taken, I can only speak to the property.
I am a servant to Mr. Taylor. On the 23d of December, about twelve o'clock, I was in Sun-street about two doors from my master's shop; I saw the prisoner go out of the shop, with the glass. There was not a soul in the shop: I made enquiry of my mistress, whether she had sold the glass; she said, she had not: I ran after the man, and came up to him in Sun-street. I asked him, where he was going with that glass, he told me, that he was going in the fields with it; I desired him to bring the glass back to where he took it from, he said he would not; I said, he should, and collared him with one hand, and took hold of the glass with the other, and brought him back.
I was coming towards his master's house, a man met me that I know perfectly well, but I cannot find him out since, he asked me to take the glass to Mr. Wilkes's house, Moorfield's, and when I received it out of his hands, I had not gone two doors before that gentleman came to me; and as to my being in the shop that day, I was not.
