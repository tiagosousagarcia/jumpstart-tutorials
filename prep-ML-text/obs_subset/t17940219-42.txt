Did you lose a flag flail and twenty-five pounds weight of Malaga plumbs?
Was there three, two in the shop and one at the door?
No. Afterwards
the other woman that was in company with her went out to the door, I was serving behind the counter, and I see her from the counter, and I seized her by the arm immediately across the counter, and as soon as I could get over the counter, the other woman was off with the plumbs. I only secured this woman, and sent for a constable; the plumbs were in the flag flail, what the Malaga plumbs comes in.
Were all the plumbs in the shop belonging to you?
Yes.
I never saw the man, and there was no woman with me, my husband then laid a dying, and he has been dead since I was in goal; there was no woman with me.
I laid hold of her arm while she was handing them out to the other woman.
Where were the plumbs?
On the further side of the shop, near the door, about two yards from it.
