The night the accident happened I slept in the house opposite, in the first floor. I was waked with something flung against the window; at the same time I heard somebody fall on the ground. Then I heard the prisoner say, Logan, he is dead, he is dead! he has thrown himself out of the window!
What time of the night was that?
I cannot tell. A little after the accident happened and the young man (the deceased) was taken into the house; the watchman called two o'clock. I jumped out of bed almost instantly, and went to the window and saw Dilley at the door with his clothes on.
He appeared to be dressed as he usually was?
Yes.
Did you enter into any conversation with Dilley?
No. I looked out at the window some time and heard the young man groan twice. Dilley went from the door up the lane, and the young man they call Logan, came down.
Was Dilley in the street almost as soon as you heard something fall?
I suppose it was not above the space of a minute at the outside.
You do not know what time of the night it was?
No.
