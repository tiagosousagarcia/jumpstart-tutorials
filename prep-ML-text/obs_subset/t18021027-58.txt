I am a linen-draper , at Shoreditch : On Monday, between ten and eleven, the prisoner came into the shop, where there was another customer, I asked her what she wanted, she said she wanted some black stockings; I brought her a pair, she said she would not have them, but asked for white worsted, or cotton; I fetched some; she bought two pair, but did not pay for them; she had her gown thrown over her shoulders, and at that time I observed she had something she should not have, between her knees, from her mode of conducting herself; she said she wanted some dark pocket handkerchiefs; I shewed her some, and she bought one, but did not pay for it; she then asked for a yellow handkerchief, I told her to go to look at some which hung up; she would not go, but said they would not wash well; she then asked me for some calimanco, which was behind me; I stood side ways and pulled it down, keeping my eye on her; she did not like any of them, but there was one in the next pile she thought she should like; I pulled it down, and bringing it to the counter, I perceived her put something into her pocket; I said, you think you like this colour? she said yes; I asked her how much she wanted, she said seven yards; I then took hold of her arm, and took her into a little room behind the shop; I asked her what she had put into her pocket; she pulled the shawl out, and said that was what she put in; that she had nothing else, and that I might search her; there were several shawls laying on the counter when she came in; I asked her if she had money; she said she had not a farthing to pay for the things; I then went and got an officer.
I was distressed, as I had just come out of the country, and did not know what to do; I had had no victuals for two days.
