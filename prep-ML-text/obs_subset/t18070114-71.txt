My husband is a carpenter , we live in Hungerford market . On the 27th of December, a little after four o'clock, I saw the prisoner going out of the house, I asked him what he did in my house, not knowing the man; a little girl that I have got saw a piece of my gown hanging out of his jacket. I took hold of the gown and took the man home to my own place, and he delivered the property up. I produce the property, they are mine.
I was stupid in liquor, and I have had a hurt in my head ever since I was discharged from the service.
