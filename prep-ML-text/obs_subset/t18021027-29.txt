I keep the Bull public-house, the corner of Saunder's gardens, Kingsland-road : Last Sunday was fortnight, the 17th of October, I bought two geese of the Leeds waggoner, they were picked, I gave thirteen and sixpence for the two; I hung them up backwards, by the safe, upon a hook, separately; I hung them up between six and seven o'clock in the morning; I lost one of them; between four and five in the afternoon, the prisoner came in and had a glass of gin; he asked the way to the necessary, my little boy got a light for him, and when he had lit him down, he said he could do his business in the dark; he came up into the tap-room, and then went out that way; I missed the goose about a quarter, or half an hour afterwards; I went to different public-houses, and at last found him at the Adam and Eve, in Hoxton, and the goose; that was about six o'clock; he was sitting on a bench close to the fire; I called for a pint of beer, went into the second box, and then I saw a goose lying on the table, not near the prisoner; I took the goose up and said, if any body here has more right to this goose than I have let them own it; the prisoner immediately said it was his; he said he had bought it by Kingstand-turnpike, of a waggoner, and given four shillings and sixpence for it; then he went out of doors, I followed him, clapped him on the shoulder, and told him I wanted to speak to him; he said, what what; I told him I would let him know before I left him; I sent for Mason, the officer, and be took charge of him.
You cannot swear to the goose?
Yes; he left this on the hook.
I was at the Adam and Eve public house, and saw the prisoner, and saw the goose; the prisoner said it is my property, Mr. Castle said it was his; I was sent for an officer.
I never had the goose in my possession; Browne has known me for sixteen years.
I have known him for twelve or fourteen years; he has worked for me; I never heard any thing against him.
