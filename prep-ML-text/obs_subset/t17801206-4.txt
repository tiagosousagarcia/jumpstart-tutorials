I am a grocer , and am in partnership with my father, Samuel Noton , and John Ewer . On Friday evening, I believe the 17th of November, I perceived some tea in a paper bag, concealed in the staircase in the back yard, leading to some warehouses. On Saturday evening about eight o'clock, I again saw it there; between ten and eleven o'clock I went there again and it was gone. At eleven o'clock we paid our men their wages; after we had paid them we shut the doors, and had them searched. The same package and the same tea, to the best of my belief, was found on the prisoner, and some raisins. I cannot swear to them; there was about two ounces and a half of tea, which is of the value of one shilling. We got a constable and searched his lodging and found some coffee, and some books of small value, and a penknife; the penknife and one of the books were mine; the other book was my brother's.
Were they your own separate property, and the other your brother's separate property, and did not belong to the partnership
They were our separate property.
How long has the prisoner lived with you?
Upwards of five years I believe.
You had a good character with him?
A very good character.
You do not swear to the tea?
It is not possible.
What is the book?
A printed book of accounts of the clerks.
