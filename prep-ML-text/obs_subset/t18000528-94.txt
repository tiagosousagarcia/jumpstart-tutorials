I am the wife of Solomon Phillips ; I keep a clothes shop, No. 33. Orchard-street, Westminster : On Tuesday, the 29th of April, between three and four o'clock in the afternoon, Levy Hart was in my house, I missed a gown and a cloak from the door; I turned round and missed four muslin aprons and a shift from the shop-window; I called Mr. Hart; I went immediately to Mr. Hart's house in Dean-street, Westminster; he is in the same line; I saw the prisoner there, sitting on a chair, with the cloak round her and one of the aprons in her lap; the gown and shift were lying by the side of her, in a bundle, in a handkerchief; I told her I could swear to the cloak and apron as the property that I lost; she said, your property ! I said, yes; I had never seen the prisoner before; then she said, if it is your property, take it; I sent for a constable, and delivered her and the things to the constable.
Mr. Phillips was out, and I went to keep Mrs. Phillips and her father company while he was out; I live at No. 2, Dean-street; after I got home the prisoner came in with two bonnets to sell; she went away and returned again in about a quarter of an hour with a bundle, and wanted to buy a pair of stockings; I saw the corner of a gown sticking out of the bundle; my wife was serving her with the stockings; I went to Mr. Phillips's again, to sit a little longer; I went up stairs, and then Mrs. Phillips went down stairs, and squalled out, I am robbed; I de sired her to make haste to my house, it might be the person; and she went directly.
The prisoner came to my shop; she had a bundle; there were four aprons; she wanted to change one of them for a pair of stockings; there was a gown and a shift; my husband came in with Mrs. Phillips, and a constable was sent for.
I have nothing to say any farther than that I was in distress.
