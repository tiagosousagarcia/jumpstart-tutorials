I am servant to Mr. Oriel, in Park-street . The prisoner was a carpenter , who was at work at our house: on the 18th of December, the prisoner was doing some repairs to the larder; at the dusk of the evening, I went to him, and said, I was going to get my tea; he said, he was going to get half a pint of porter, instead of tea; the room that I sat in, was just opposite of the kitchen door; I could see every thing that passed there; I saw him put something in his coat pockets, he ran up stairs; I said, stop, I'll light you; he ran out, and left the street door open; I shut the street door, and ran down in the kitchen immediately; I looked after the four articles of copper, they were gone, I had them in my hand at twelve o'clock, there had been nobody in the house but he and I. I went to the public-house, where he said, he was going to have half a pint of beer, he was not there; then I went to Mr. Watson's, he brought a constable, and when the prisoner returned, he had got a new piece of board in his hand; I asked him whether he had been to the shop for it, he said, he had not; he said, this board I took out with me, and I brought it back again, because he thought I suspected he had taken something out. His master came, and said, he had been to his shop for the board. Then he was taken in custody.
Were these things ever found afterwards.
No.
He returned back to his work, and was taken from his work.
Yes. He was gone an hour and a half.
I am a beadle; I was sent for. This young woman informed me that the carpenter had robbed them; the prisoner said, he took nothing but this board, and he brought it back to shew her.
I am foreman to Mr. Charles Royce ; his shop is in Brewer-street. On the 17th of December, about half past five or six o'clock, the prisoner came to the shop for the board. It belongs to a sash in the larder.
I am quite innocent.
