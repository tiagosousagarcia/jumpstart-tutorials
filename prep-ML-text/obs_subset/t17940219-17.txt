I am a married woman, my husband's name is Thomas. I did not lose my property, I have got it again, it was taken the 22d of January.
What was taken?
Three linen shirts, and a pair of stockings, they were taken off the line, the line was cut.
Did you see them taken?
I did not.
How soon did you discover they were taken away?
In a quarter of an hour, they had not been out more than that, it was between one and two o'clock when they were taken.
How soon after they were taken away did you get them back again?
They were not carried off the premises, with the alarm they were dropped in the garden; I never see him till he was brought back again, I am certain they were my property.
I saw the lad go into the garden, and I saw him cut the line in three places, and he was going to take the property away, and he saw me coming across the field, and he dropped them in the garden to make his escape, he had removed them better then further from you to me, I took the boy, and that is the boy.
Did you know any thing of him before?
No.
I was going along, and there were three young men met me, and they told me to go and cut the line for them, and they would give me six-pence when I came back, accordingly I went as they asked me.
