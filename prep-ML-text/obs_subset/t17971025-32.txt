I am the sister of Thomas Dewell. On the 11th of October, about two in the afternoon, I lost two linen aprons, and two check linen aprons, from a back-room, near the Chapel, Old Brentford ; it is my mother's house; the prisoner lived next door; the window had been opened and propped up with a stick, that she must have got in that way: I found her in the room, I asked her what she did there; she said, she was going to hang the clothes out to dry; she said, she thought I was busy, and she did it to assist me: I asked her why she did not come to the front door, and ask me if she should assist me; she said she was afraid she should disturb me; she then got out at the window into an alley, the same way that she got in; she dropped the two linen aprons in the alley; they were all on a table; the door was not locked. I got a constable, and delivered her and the things to him; we found the other two aprons and the shawl in a room in the house where she lives, not her own room.
I am a gardener; I heard the cry of stop thief, and saw the prisoner running, and stopped her about 100 yards from this girl's house, near the alley; nothing passed between her and me. I took her to this woman's house, and a constable was sent for.
These linen aprons are my brother's, I wash for him, he is a tallow-chandler; I have no doubt at all about it.
Her mother brought me these things to pawn; and I carried her a plate of sheep's liver fried, and a quartern of gin.
Was there any intimacy between your mother and the prisoner?
She has come in to ask my mother how she did, no farther.
