I am a baker , No. 49, Old Compton-street ; I lost a coat and waistcoat from a small room over my shop; I did not see the prisoner take it; I lost it last Thursday morning, a few minutes past eight, and had seen it there at that time; I found it again on the woman, and took it from her just at the shop-door; I asked her what she had got in her apron; she said, nothing of mine; presently I laid hold of it, and took it from her, and have kept them ever since.
I am a cabinet-maker; I saw the things in her possession, and saw them taken from her.
I never was in the place, nor ever saw the things in my life.
