On the 10th of May, a quarter before nine in the evening, I stowed my boat at our junk chain, where we fasten them for the night; the prisoner gave me a cast on shore that very night, the next morning the boat was gone, I could not hear any thing of her, till the 15th of May following, when I found her at the Thames Police-office, Wapping, disfigured; I knew her to be my boat; I had hired the boat of Mr. Hodges from February the 22d, up to Christmas next, I was to pay him three shillings per week.
I let Thomas Knight a wherry-boat, on the 22d of February; I saw the same boat afterwards at the Policeoffice; I built her, and marked her with this marking-iron, five of the marks were punched in her bottom, and four in her keel; I am sure she is the same boat.
I was at work, repairing the boat for the prisoner, when the officers came and took it away.
I apprehended the prisoner at his lodgings in Old Gravel-lane; I found the boat upon some timbers, a little beyond New Crane-stairs, Mr. Hodge's name is branded on the bottom of the keel.
I bought the boat of a quartermaster, who was in the service with me last war, he is gone to sea again.
