I believe you are a wire-worker, and live on Holborn-hill?
I am, in partnership with my father, Thomas Cato ; I knew the prisoner as a servant to Mr. Yerraway: On the 9th of July, he came to me for payment of a bill of 5l. 1s. I told him Mr. Yerraway was in a great hurry, but if he would take off the discount, I did not want credit, there was the money; he said he would go, and enquire; he went away, and in about twenty miutes returned, saying, he would take off the discount; he took off 5s. and I paid him 4l. 16s. he gave me a receipt, which I have here. (Produces it, and it is read.)
You are sure the prisoner is the person who gave you that receipt?
I am.
You are a timber and coal-merchant in Earl-street, Bank-friars?
I am; the prisoner was my servant.
Did you authorize him on the 9th of July to call on Messrs. Cato and Son for 5l. 1s.?
I did not.
Did you authorize him to allow any discount upon that bill?
No.
Do you know the prisoner's hand-writting?
I believe this to be his hand-writing.
Was that money ever brought to account?
It was not; I did not discover it till October, when I went to demand 7l. of Meffrs. Cato, and adn they told me part of it had been paid.
Did not the prisoner say, that what he had done was by the direction of the young man who has just been convicted?
Yes.
How many years has the prisoner lived with you?
Fourteen or fixteen years; I am very certain it is fourteen years; when the prisoner was apprehended, he said he had paid the money to my clerk.
I was sent by Mr. Clarke for the money; Mr. Cato would not pay it without a discount being allowed; I went back to Mr. Clarke, adn he directed me to allow it; Mr. Cato paid me, and I never eat, drank, or stopped, till I had paid the money to Mr. Clarke, in Mr. Yerraway's counting-house.
