I am a publican ; I live at the Golden Lion, King-street, St. James ; the prisoner was my servant , On the 25th of November, I gave him a 10 l. and a five pound note, I said, Robert, go to Ransom's and Morland's, and get me small change, the ten pound note was a bank note, and the five pound was a country note, Messrs. Ransom and Co. were my banker's; I sent him there to get change, I gave him the note in the presence of Mr. Thomas Marks .
Did he bring back the change.
No; by his staying so long I went and found he had changed the ten pound note. The next time I saw him was about three weeks afterwards, I met him in Lombard-street, and took him to the Poultry Compter. I have entrusted him with larger sums of money before this, he always behaved honest in them.
Did you ever get the produce of these notes again.
No; I never got any part of them, nor he never gave me any account what he had done with the money.
Have you ever seen the notes again.
No; I gave them to him in the presence of a gentleman who is here, he was to get change ar Ransom's and Morland's.
Is there any body here from Ramsom's and Morland's
No; he got the ten pound in notes and the five pound in cash; I firmly believe at Messrs. Ransom's and Co.
I saw the notes delivered to the prisoner by his master.
