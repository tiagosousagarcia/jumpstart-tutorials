I am a chimney-sweeper: last Sunday was a fortnight, I lost the things mentioned in the indictment, from my lodgings; I did not see the prisoner take them; but after he was taken up, he confessed to me that he had taken them, and that he had made away with them.
I am a pawnbroker: the prisoner pawned a watch at our house, on the 10th of October, (produces it) I lent him half a guinea upon it.
This is my watch.
I took these coats in of the prisoner, on the 10th of Oct. he was in a chimneysweeper's dress, and the coats were sooty; I had no suspicion that they were not his own.
They are both my coats.
I had the things given me by a girl.
