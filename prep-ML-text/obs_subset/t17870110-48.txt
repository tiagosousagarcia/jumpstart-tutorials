I was fetched to the watch-house about twelve that evening; there was a fire; and a person was taken with a quantity of shoes; I saw the shoes there, and the person both; I ascertained them to be James Bampstead 's property.
I am a watchman in Prince's-street, Leicester-fields; between ten and eleven, I met the prisoner with a parcel of shoes in her apron; I asked her, where she was going; she said, she was going home; I asked where she got them; she said, she got them at Mr. Bamstead's; I asked her, who gave them to her; she said, nobody gave them, she took them herself, because they were in distress, to keep them in safety; because the house was on fire; I asked her, where she was going to; she said, she was going home; I said, I should take her to the watch-house, and the shoes to Mr. Bampstead's, that was the properest place; I took her to the watch-house, and went to Mr. Bampstead's, and the foreman came between ten and eleven, and owned the shoes to be Mr. Bampstead's property. (The shoes produced, thirty-seven pair.) These are the same shoes that were produced at the watch-house.
I looked them all over at the watch-house, and they are all Mr. Bampstead's property.
I wish Mr. Gray would give me the character I deserve?
I have known her about a twelvemonth; and I have heard a number of people speak well of her; and I never knew any thing amiss of her before this; she is belonging to a man that did work for Mr. Bampstead sometime; she worked for him; she lives with a man, either as his wife, or lived with him as such; she then worked for Mr. Bampstead at closing the upper leathers, about six months before this time; she was not employed to take care of the things at this time, as I know of; I detected her before I stopped her with these shoes; she had another bundle, before, I spoke to her, she dropped it; when I saw her at the watch-house, I knew her again.
I went to help Mr. Bampstead in his distress, as me and my husband worked for him.
