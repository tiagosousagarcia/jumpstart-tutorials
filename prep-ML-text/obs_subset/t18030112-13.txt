I am a stationer , in Lime-street : On Tuesday the 21st of December, between one and two o'clock, I lost three packs of cards; my apprentice saw the prisoner take them; I was called down, and the prisoner was brought back with three packs of cards in his bosom; they were playing cards; the apprentice took them from him, and I delivered them to the constable; I had seen them in the window half an hour before; when I was called down, I missed them immediately; they had the picture of a Highlander upon them.
The prisoner came into our house to buy a penny sheet of brown paper; he asked for a remarkable stout one; I stooped down to get him one, and while I was stooping down, I observed him shoving his hand into his bosom; I suspected he had taken something out of the window; when he went out of the shop, I called my master down to know if he missed any thing; he missed the cards, and I went after the prisoner, and caught him in Lime-street-square; I told him he must come back with me; he came back with me very quietly; when he came back, I put my hand into his bosom, and pulled out three packs of cards; there is no mark upon them; I cannot swear to them.( William Wood , a constable, produced the cards.)
I bought the cards in Fenchurch-street.
