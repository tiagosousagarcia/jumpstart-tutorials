I am a patrol of Clapton, and heard the watchman talking to the prisoner; he said to me, this man has got some flour; I asked him how he came by it; and he said his master allowed it him, and that foreman Frost had tied it up for him in the handkerchief.
I am a constable; I asked the prisoner how he came by the flour; he said, it was given him by his master, and that the foreman had tied it up for him; I don't know where the mills are; I have kept the flour ever since. (Produces it.)
I apprehended the prisoner at five o'clock in the morning, going along with the flour, which he said was his own, and had been tied up for him by foreman Frost.
I am foreman to the prosecutors, and the prisoner worked in the mill; our hours are from nine to nine; he should have staid till nine next morning, but he had ground all his wheat out; the mill stopped about four o'clock in the morning; I sleep in the mill-house, and left the mill in his care; he locked the door, and took the key with him; there is sometimes an allowance made if a bargain is made for it, but I don't know whether there was any or not made to him; I had not given him any.
This man had a good character?
Yes, very good.
And did his business very well?
Yes, he suited our purpose very well indeed; I did not give him any flour, nor did I miss any.
The mill belongs to my brother John and myself; I gave the prisoner eighteen shillings a week, and nothing else; we never do, except to the foreman, for his puddings; I had a very good opinion of the prisoner, and would have trusted him with the mill for a week together; I cannot swear to the flour.
I leave my defence to my Counsel.
