I am a shopman of Messrs. Blyth, Aldersgate-street : on the 31st of January, the prisoner at the bar came to the shop, about seven in the evening; he addressed himself to me, and desired to see some linen for shirts, and he paid me down 7 s. I immediately knew them to be bad money; I shewed the money to Messrs. Blyth, and then sent for a constable; when the constable came, I asked him how he came by this money; he told me he had it in change for half-a-guinea; the constable searched him, every part, and at last he found three shillings, and two sixpences, in his mouth; I saw them taken out; I wrapped the seven shillings in one paper, and the three shillings and two sixpences in another, and delivered them to the constable.
Had he any other monies about him?
None.
I am a constable: I searched the prisoner on the 3d of January, about seven in the evening; I asked the prisoner if he offered these shillings, and searched him, and asked him if he had any more about him; he said no; I found nothing in his pockets, but I observed something the matter with his mouth, and I told him to open his mouth, and he put out three shillings and two sixpences; I took them, and put them separate in a paper, and have kept them ever since. (Produced.) I produce also the seven shillings I took off the counter: they all appear to be bad.
I have attended on this business twenty-three years; these seven shillings are all bad, most of them of the same manufactory: these three shillings and two sixpences are counterfeit likewise.
I leave it with the gentlemen of the Jury to do just as they please: I have got two or three witnesses.
I am a master butcher: I don't know what business he is now; he lived with me two years ago; then he was an honest lad, to the best of my knowledge.
