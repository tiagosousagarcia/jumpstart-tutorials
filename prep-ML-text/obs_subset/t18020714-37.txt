I am a waterman: I was on board a boat that lay along-side the Sally Gravesend boat: On Sunday morning, I turned out about three o'clock, I saw the prisoner on deck tying something in a handkerchief, and making toward the shore; I immediately took hold of him, and said, you rascal, you have been robbing the boat; he said, no, he had not, he had been sleeping there all night; upon that, he took the clothes up in his arms, and threw them down below again, and went below himself; he called out, Joe, Joe. you know me; he told me he had been sleeping with him all night; when the money was taken from him, he said, don't take that half-crown, it is mine.
The money is all my own.
