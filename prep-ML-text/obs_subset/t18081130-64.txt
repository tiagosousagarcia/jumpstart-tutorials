You are a publican
Yes; I keep the Brill House, Somers' Town; the prisoner was my pot boy .
Was he employed to receive the money for your weekly bills
He was.
Did Mr. Wells deal with you
Yes.
Was he indebted to you
Yes; seven shillings and eleven pence halfpenny.
How do you know that
By the prisoner setting it down; I had the account from the prisoner which I had on a slate; I copied this from the slate; it is an exact copy.
I met the prisoner on the Sunday that he said he was to leave his master, in Wilson street; I asked him to tell me how my account was; he told me it was sixteen pots and a pint; I then informed him he was wrong; I should not pay him then; I desired him to call on the Monday following. He did not call on the Monday; I believe it was on the Wednesday or Thursday evening he called; he was then paid seven shillings and eleven penee halfpenny; he said my account was right, fifteen pots and a pint, and one shilling and sixpence for liquor. I always kept an account against him. I do not recollect the day of the month; it was the day that he went from his master.
Mr. Perry, what day was it he left you
I believe it was on a Sunday unbeknown to me; I had hired another man, but I had not discharged the prisoner.
Upon your oath had you received this seven shillings and eleven pence halfpenny
I had not; he had never brought it to account.
The customers owed me so much I was afraid he would be angry; I was turned away without an hour's notice.
When I returned from the country I found he was gone away; the bills not paid amounted to three pounds eighteen shillings. I sent a note to him by the lamp lighter that he knew, if he would come it would be all right; he did not come.
How did he behave
Very bad indeed.
I gave Mr. Perry a month's warning; I settled with him except five shillings and ten pence; I told him I was agreeable to stop till all was settled if he was agreeable. Soon after he got another man; I was willing to have all things meet with him.
Is the account between you and him settled
There are eighty seven pots he took out unsettled.
Supposing you had given him time, do you not suppose that he could have settled this business
I offered him all the time in the world; he would not come forward.
