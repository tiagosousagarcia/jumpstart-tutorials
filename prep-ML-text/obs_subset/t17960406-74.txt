I live with Mr. Goode, linen-draper , the corner of Gray's-Inn-lane . On the Ist of March the prisoner came into our shop to buy a piece of cloth; after I had sold it her, she asked to look at a muslin handkerchief; she asked the price of several, and at last I missed one; and in searching of her I found it, she pulled it out of her pocket - hole; I knew it to be our's, it was very dirty; it had been in our shop - window a long time; it is not marked, (produces it) It laid loose upon the counter when she took it.
I never had it, nor never saw it.
