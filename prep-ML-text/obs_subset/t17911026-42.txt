I sell muffins about the street , on the 2d of this month, the corner of Tower-street, Seven-dials , I lost a shirt and waistcoat out of my pocket, I had them five minutes before; I do not know who took them, I did not see the prisoner there. I never saw them since.
On the 2d of October I saw the prisoner between Tower-street and the corner of the Seven Dials. This old gentleman was going by, and I saw this prisoner take out the shirt and neckcloth, and put it into his bosom. I knew the prisoner, and I knew the other; says I, be ashamed, give it him again; he gave me ill language, and made a motion and ran; I lost him, I knew him, and the next morning I saw him, I followed him to a cellar, and fetched the prosecutor; we waited for his coming, I seized him, he said, Oh d - n you, and gave very ill language; then he offered to pay for the shirt, and me for my trouble and lost time, but I secured him.
On the Monday morning I was informed of the robbery, the prisoner offered to pay for it; I said you shall go before the Bench of Justices. D - n my eyes, says he, I do not care for the Bench of Justices nor you either.
I stood at the Dials a considerable time, and the next morning they took me.
