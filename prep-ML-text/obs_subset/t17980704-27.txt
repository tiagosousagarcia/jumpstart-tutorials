I am the wife of Evan Morris ; the prisoner lodged in the same house with me: I lost my cloak from a drawer in my room; I missed it in the afternoon, I believe, of the 2d of June; I saw it the next day, at Queen-square, in the hands of Mr. Gordon, a pawnbroker.
I am a pawnbroker: On Saturday, the 2d of June, a little after four, the prisoner brought me this cloak, and asked twenty shillings; she said, her name was Elizabeth Young , that she lodged at No. 41, Chandos-street; I pretended to make out the ticket, while I sent one of my boys to see if it was true, and the boy brought word it was not; I told her, I suspected it was not her own, and I would not part with it; then she said, she lived in Strutton-ground, and afterwards, she said, she lived at No. 22, Poland-street; that was where Mrs. Morris lived. (Produces the cloak).
I live at No. 22, Poland-street. This is my cloak.
The cloak was lent to me; I was in distress, and pledged it. I expected my husband home in a few days, and I intended to replace it again.
