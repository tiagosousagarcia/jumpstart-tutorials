I am the wife of John Fletcher ; we live in Cecil-street ; the prisoner was employed occasionally as a washerwoman and chairwoman . I cannot recollect on what day these things were taken, but I dare say they were not all taken at the same time. The constable whom we employed searched her lodging, and found several duplicates.
I was there a charing; and the gentlewoman went out of town, and my husband was in great distress, and he went with me, and made me pledge these things; and he had the money.
