This is the ribbon, I picked it up, I know it by being put on an irregular block; it was inconvenient to mend the window at that time of day, and several pins were stuck into it; the pins were all forced away.
Please you, my Lord, and Gentlemen of the Jury, I stand here for a crime of which I am totally innocent; neither of my prosecutors can say they found any thing on me, how then, my Lord, and Gentlemen, upon your wife opinion, can I be guilty of this offence: I humbly throw myself on your lenient protection and humanity, for I am innocent of the crime.
