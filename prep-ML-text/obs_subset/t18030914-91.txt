You are pay-clerk in the office of Mr. Smith?
I am; he is agent to pay the out-pensioners of Chelsea-hospital.
Had you upon your books a pensioner of the name of Thomas Heasty ?
Yes, of the 78th regiment.
At what time would he have been entitled to the payment of any money from the hospital?
On the 25th of June; they are paid a half-yearly advance to the 25th of December, but his regiment would not have been paid till the 21st of July.
Do you remember the prisoner coming to your Office upon any occasion?
Yes, perfectly; but before that, a woman, saying she was Mrs. Heasty, had come for a blank receipt; it is a custom to grant blank receipts when a man is incapable of coming himself: On the 16th of July, I received a letter, signed by Mr. Morgan, saying that this man had been dead a month; I therefore provided an officer in case the woman should come to receive the money on the 21st of July, but she did not come, the prisoner at the bar came; I said to him, I don't think this is Heasty's writing; he said, yes, it is; I said, how do you know; he said, I saw him write it; I asked him how long since, and he said about a week or ten days; I then had him taken into custody. The receipt was filled up by one of my clerks before it was given to the woman; he is not here, but I can swear to his hand-writing; no person but myself or my clerks can get possession of them.
Is that the receipt that was brought to you by the prisoner? - (Shewing it to him.)
Yes; I put my initials upon it; the name has evidently been penciled, and written over afterwards; this is not like his hand-writing; I never saw him write, but I have seen his writing; when a man is able to come himself the receipt is in a receipt book.
You were one of the overseers of St. Bride's in July last?
I was.
Do you remember a man of the name of Thomas Heasty being in your workhouse?
Yes, very well; I understood he was an outpensioner, and received his pension half-yearly; I have seen him write; this is not like his handwriting; this is Hasty, and he spelt his name Heasty.
What are you?
Master of St. Bride's workhouse; Thomas Heasty died in our workhouse on the 15th of June; he told me himself that he was an out-pensioner of Chelsea Hospital -
The night before I went to that gentleman's office, I met Mrs. Heasty in Shoe-lane, and she asked me to fetch the money for her; she told me she would give me a new shirt for my trouble.
