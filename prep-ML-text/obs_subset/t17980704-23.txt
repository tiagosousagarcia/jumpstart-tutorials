I keep the George, at Enfield ; I do not know any thing of the robbery, I was out at the time.
I am the daughter of the last witness: On the 21st of June, the prisoner came to my mother's house as a private in the Fifeshire Sencibles, with a billet, he staid in the house about two hours, he called for a pint of beer, and went out while the beer was drawing; I heard a noise in the street, and he was brought back in about ten minutes to the gate by Mr. Young and Mr. Taylor, he was not brought into the house; the ham and mortar were brought back with him.
Mr. Taylor and I were returning home to Enfield, and observed the prisoner getting over a hedge; I rode up to him, and asked him what he was breaking the fences for; he said he wanted to sleep; I asked him what he had got in his pocket; Mr. Taylor said it was a ham; we jumped off our horses, and took him by the collar; he then got out of the coat, it was a very large great goat, and he and Mr. Taylor had a struggle; we took him just by the George; a constable came up, and we delivered him to the constable. (The property produced).
After he was brought back, I searched the house, and missed the ham and a brass mortar, the mortar was upon a shelf under the ham; I cannot say when I had seen the ham before, I did not take particular notice, it was a ham like this; the mortar I know to be my mother's.
