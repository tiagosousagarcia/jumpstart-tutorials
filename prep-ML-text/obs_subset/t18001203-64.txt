Will you favour us with your firm?
George-Augustas Nash, George Vandernuneberg , and Andrew John Nash ; we have a shop in Cornhill; some of my warehouses are in Finch-lane.
At the time you charged the prisoner with this offence, was he in your service?
Yes, as porter ; he had lived with me about five or six months.
Had you, before this offence, missed any of your property?
Yes, we suspected the prisoner.
In consequence of that suspicion, what did you do?
The prisoner, upon the Tuesday evening, was in the act of shutting up the shop; and as we were determined, in consequence of lo sing several articles, to watch him, he did not come in so readily as I could wish, and I went out and brought him in with me, and I asked him what he had got in his pockets; I put my hand upon the outside of his pocket, and I felt something like a bread and butter plate; I then pushed him forwards towards the desk, and he took out of his pocket a China bread and butter plate, and a black milk-pot; I then asked him where he got them; he told me, in the warehouse, and that they were our property; I neither threatened him, or made any promises; we then sent for a constable, and went and searched his lodgings, and we found the other articles stated in the indictment.
Were those such articles as you dealt in?
Yes, they were; I believe them all to be my property.
Were there any particular marks about the plate you took out of his pocket?
It was a very remarkable one; we had had it in the house man years; it was a very old-fashioned pattern.
You dealt in those articles, but you cannot swear to them?
I am positive they are my property.
I was present when the property was taken from the prisoner.(The property was produced and deposed to by the prosecutor).
