I met the prisoner at the bar with a gate and chain on the 5th of December, at the corner of Catherine-wheel-yard, in Windmill-street.
I am a carpenter, in King-street, Golden-square; I lost a gate in Panton-square; it stood in a room of a house that was repairing; I lost it on the 5th of this month, and it was brought to my shop on the 6th by Mr. Northam.
I am a plaistere: On Wednesday night, the 5th of this month, the gate was missing; the prisoner came to work the next morning as usual; I asked him where it was, and he generously told me where it was.
What did you say to him?
I asked him where it was, and he told me at No. 35, Great Windmill-street; I went there and fetched it.
This is my gate, I know it by the chain and the fastenings, I had had it some years.
Was it at an old iron shop?
Yes.
What did you see him do with the gate?
Nothing, only he passed me with it.
I brought the prisoner down into the kitchen, where Mrs. Maycock was; she said, he was the man, and then he told me where it was.
I keep an earthenware and broker's shop, and deal in old iron, in Windmill-street; the prisoner came to my house about one o'clock in the day, and asked me if I bought old iron; I told him I did, if it was their own.
You are sure you told him that?
Yes; he said, it was his own, and I told him not to bring it unless it was; I gave him five farthings a pound for it.
That is the full value of it, I take it for granted?
Yes; we do not get three halfpence a pound for it ourselves.
Are your sure that is the man?
I am not positive, I had seen him but that once, I believe he is the man.
My Lord and Gentlemen, I met with this gate in an alley, as I was coming out of Panton-square; I sold it at this shop; I stumbled against it as I came out of the alley.
What is the prisoner?
A plasterer and labourer; he has worked with his master, I believe, three quarters of a year, or a year.
