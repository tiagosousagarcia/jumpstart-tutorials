I am a journeyman hair-dresser ; I am a lodger; I lost four linen shirts from my lodgings, No. 13, Tash-street, Gray's-inn-lane , in November, I believe; the first was on the 4th; the woman was a stranger to me; she and her husband called to let me know my child was well in the country; I believe this was on the 2d of November; my child was in the country; my wife employed her to wash for me; after that, I told her she might come and see what was wanted to do, and I would give her her victuals for it: she had a fit, and frightened my wife, and went away one Saturday night; and the next time my wife went to wash, she missed four shirts; this was on the 12th of December: I found them at the pawnbroker's: he is here.
I missed my linen when I went to sort it out of the foul-clothes bag.
I am a pawnbroker: I produce four shirts, pawned by the prisoner at the bar, at different times; I have not the least doubt of the woman.
I was very much distressed when I came to London, and I went to Mr. Addison's to help her to wash, and she lent me the shirts to pawn; and because I did not get them out against the time, she did this from spite: I was very poor; my husband had but six shillings a week.
Had you ever any quarrel with this woman?
Never in my life.
Did you ever give her any shirts to pawn?
Never in my life, upon my oath.
