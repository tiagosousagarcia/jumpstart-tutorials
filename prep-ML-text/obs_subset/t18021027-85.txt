I live at No. 28, in Church-street, Bethnal-green ; I keep a cloaths-shop : On the evening of the 28th of September I returned home about nine o'clock, and found the shop had been robbed; on the morning of the 29th I attended at Worship-street, and found the prisoner and the property; they have no mark upon them, but I believe them to be mine; they had not been long in the shop; but I cannot swear to them.
I am one of the patrol belonging to Worship-street: On Tuesday evening the 28th of September, I was going up Church-street, with Ray, about half past eight o'clock, I saw the prisoner and another boy at the door; I watched them, and saw the prisoner come out of the shop, with the property in his hand; I stopped him, and the other got away.
A boy came out with the things, and dropped them close by me.
