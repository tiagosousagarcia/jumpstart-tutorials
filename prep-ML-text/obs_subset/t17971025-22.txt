I am a cheese-monger in Spital-fields . On the 26th of September, about eight o'clock at night, I saw the prisoner passing backwards and forwards in the street; the bacon hung at the door, and I and another laid wait for him; he came to it several times, and at last he took it off the hook and went away with it; I stopped him, and gave charge of him.
This was at night, and dark?
Yes.
Do you mean to swear that that is the man that took the bacon?
Yes, that is the man.
What coloured coat had he on?
A whitish coat on.
Did you never say it was a man in a blue coat?
No; there was a man in a blue coat with him.
You might have prevented the these if you pleased, by taking in the bacon?
Yes.
I saw the prisoner take the bacon off the hook, and go away with it.
I am entirely innocent of the fact.
I heard the prosecutor say it was a man in a blue coat; and I heard him say he would not swear to any one.
