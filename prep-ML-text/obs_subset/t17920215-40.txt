I lost a pair of half-boots from behind the door, on the 11th of February, on Saturday: he took them from a nail, and laid them down on a tea-chest, with other goods; he then turned about to the other part of the street, and took his apron off, and came back with his apron under his arm, and lay his apron over the half-boots, as they lay on the chest; then drew them up so, that they could not be seen; I instantly ran after him, and took them from him; it was his own apron: I bought them of a gentleman's servant; I marked them, after he stole them, and gave them to the constable.
I am a shoemaker: I was informed that the prisoner was about Mr. Ford's door; I went and saw him take the half-boots off the nail, on Saturday the 11th of this month; I was present when the prosecutor took them from him.
He has took me at a very great nonplus, or I could have brought very good friends to my character; I have 20 l. a year annuity; I could have sent for Alderman Harley: I picked them up in the street.
