I am a carpenter; I know the prisoner: On the 5th of July, in he afternoon, I saw him strip the lead off, and take at down through the trap door; I saw him come again through the trap-door, and begin to cut the gutters; this lead had been nailed on the trap-door; here were about ten or twelve pounds of lead taken.
In consequence of what had been told me, I went with one Mosely, Williams, and another carpenter, and saw the prisoner come from the top of the house.
I went to the top of an adjoining house, and there I saw the prisoner running along the top; he jumped down and got on the garden wall; I cried out, stop thief.
I had the key of Mr. Jones's house; I went in and up stairs; before I got up, I saw the prisoner jump off the third house from our's, and run away; I called, stop thief; on the prisoner's being taken, I saw the lead; it sitted the trap-door; I saw a piece that came out of the middle of the gutter; I sitted it with the rest.
