- I am shopman to Mr. Marley, linen-draper , in Holborn : The prisoner came, with another young woman, last Wednesday morning, between eight and nine o'clock, to look at some printed calicos for gowns; I shewed her several, amongst the rest I shewed her this piece, (producing it) they fixed upon a pattern for a gown, and ordered it to be put by; they said they would leave two shillings, and when they came back again they would pay the remainder part of the money.
What was the value of it?
Thirty shillings; they went away then, and before they had got out at the door, I missed this piece of print; I ran after them directly, and brought the prisoner back; I found this piece of print concealed in her apron.
See if that is your master's property?
Yes; here is the length of it in my own writing.
I did not see her take the property, I saw her bring it back again.
