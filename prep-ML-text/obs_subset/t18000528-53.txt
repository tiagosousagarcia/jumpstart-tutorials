I am the wife of William Smith , I live in Artichoke-lane, St. George's in the East ; I lost a pair of silver buckles from a little drawer under my husband's bed; I saw them on the Sunday in my husband's shoes; I saw them at the pawnbroker's on the Monday following.
On Monday the 5th of May, I apprehended the prisoner in Long-alley, Moorfields; I searched her, I asked her what she had done with the buckles, she said they were at Mr. Purse's, the pawnbroker, in Wentworth-street, Whitechapel; I went there and found them, and found the duplicate upon her.
I am a pawnbroker; on the 28th of April, the prisoner pledged these buckles with Mr. Purse, I was in the shop at the time, (produces them;) I lent her nine shillings, and on the Monday following she came and asked if I would lend her three shillings more upon them, which I did, I had known her before for some time, I believe she used to work at slop work.
These buckles are my husband's property; the prisoner's farher lodges with me, she came to me on the 26th, she remained there till the 28th.
I went to see my father, and being very much in distress, I took them and pledged them at Mr. Purse's.
