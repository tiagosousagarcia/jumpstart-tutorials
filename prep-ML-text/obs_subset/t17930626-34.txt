I am an upholder and cabinet maker . On the 14th of June I had some information from Mr. Edward Smith respecting the prisoner, and I got up the next morning between four and five o'clock, and at five o'clock the prisoner came and rattled at my door, at the latch, he was a stranger to me, then I did not know him, he came to the shop door; I have only one door, and then I asked of my boy if he had not sold some things out of the shop? I did not meddle with the prisoner that morning; the Monday morning following he came again; on the 4th, I see him there, I was in the street on the opposite side of the way, and when I came nigh the door, I heard him say to my boy, there is your master. On Monday morning the 18th, I had two officers ready to apprehend him, he was apprehended in my shop; he rattled at the door, and we opened the door, it was at five o'clock in the morning.
Did you hear him rattle at the door yourself?
Yes.
Did you go to him?
Yes.
Did you say any thing to him?
I asked him how he came to buy any thing out of my shop? he said he had only bought some rags; I called my apprentice and asked him if that was the man that he sold the harateen furniture to? he said it was; he said this in the presence of the prisoner.
What did the prisoner say to that?
He did not say any thing particular.
I am an apprentice.
Have you ever been told what will become of you if you swear that which is false? suppose you tell a story, what will become of you in the next world?
God will correct me.
Which way will you be corrected? have you not been told how you will be corrected?
No.
