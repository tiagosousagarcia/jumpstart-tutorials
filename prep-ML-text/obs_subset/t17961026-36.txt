I keep a public-house in Brewer-street, Golden-square : The prisoner lodged with me; I lost a shirt; the duplicate of the shirt was found upon him.
When had you seen it before it was lost?
It was lost out of the basket of clean linen that had just been washed.
I am a constable of the night: When this man was taken into custody, he was brought to St. James's watch-house, and I searched him; I found a duplicate upon him; I went to the pawnbroker, and Dorman went with me.
I am servant to a pawnbroker, Mrs. Hall, in Rathbone-place.
Do you remember the prisoner coming to you?
Yes, repeatedly; he brought me a shirt; he pawned it for 3s. he said it was his own property, (produces it.)
It is my property; it is marked J.D. the collar is gone out of the thread.
I asked the prosecutor's wife to lend me a shirt, and she lent me that shirt.
