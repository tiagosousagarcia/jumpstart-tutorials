I am clerk to William Edridge , a copper and brass-founder , and has a manufactory at Goswell-place , where the prisoner worked; I know nothing of the loss.
I work for Mr. Edridge. On the 1st of December, in consequence of having missed some copper, I marked three pieces, and gave them to Harrison and Ritchie, and they put an additional mark to them; the next day they suspected the prisoner, and I went after him; he had got about forty or fifty yards from the premises; I called to him to come back; he asked what I wanted; I told him, from the appearance of his coat, I thought he had something that was not his own; he turned his left pocket to me, and took out this copper, which I can swear to be my master's property.
This is the same piece of copper that I marked; it is my master's property.
This is the same that I marked.
I found it on a heap of dust outside the gate.
