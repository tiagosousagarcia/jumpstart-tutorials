I am a carcass-butcher , No. 44, Aldgate High-street: I can only swear to the property.
I am servant to Mr. Boot: On Friday the 29th of January, in the morning, I went to call one of my fellow-servants, and as I was coming back, I saw the prisoner coming from our house with the meat upon his shoulder; I stopped him, and asked him where he was going with it; he said, he was going to take it to Mr. Squires's, that is a carcass-butcher at the top of the street; I took it from him, told him it was my master's property, and I would swear to it; I kept him till my fellow-servant came up, and then we took him to the watch-house; the meat consisted of the two hind quarters of a sheep, the two fore quarters had been sold to the Jews; I knew it by a score that we make when we dress it; I went home immediately and missed it.
Suppose you had seen it at York, would you have sworn to it?
No; but I saw the prisoner come from our shop with it.
We mark all the quarters differently; I kill a great many sheep for graziers, and we are obliged to mark them differently that we may know them one from another.
If you had seen it at York, could you have sworn to it?
Yes.
When they are cut for the Jews, they only mark the sides, and, I believe, there are people in Court, that can testify they never saw a pair of hind quarters marked.
