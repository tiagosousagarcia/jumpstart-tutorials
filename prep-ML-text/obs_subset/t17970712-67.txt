I was from home at the time of the robbery.
The prisoner came into my shop on the 13th of July, about three o'clock in the afternoon, and asked for some gold drops; I took out a parcel to shew him some, I took out two pair; he seemed to make choice of one, I took all the rest away; he then asked to look at some gold rings; I left them on the counter while I went round to the other counter to shew him the gold rings; I took out half-a-dozen, and he seemed to object to them, he said they were not well made, they were not round; I told him I had none better made; and then he said, they were not the size; I went to get out some more, and, I suppose, at that time he took the gold chain; he said, I must send them to No. 7; I asked him where No. 7, was; he seemed a great deal agitated, and not knowing where it was himself; he said, it is over the way, and immediately went away; I missed the chain immediately after he was gone, I ran out to the shop-door, and saw him running up Barbican, I called out stop thief, Mr. Hayward, a neighbour, ran after me; I told him that was the man in the brown coat, and he was brought back, but nothing was found upon him.
I live opposite Mr. Cole, in Barbican: I saw Mrs. Cole run out to the door in a hurry, she desired me to follow that man in the brown coat; I pursued him till he was caught.
I was going to Clerkenwellgreen when I was stopped, I never had been in the shop at all; I was armourer on board the Middlesex East-Indiaman, since that, I have been to America, and one voyage to the West-Indies.
