I lost a coat, a brewer's jacket, and a hat, from the Queen's-head, in Poultney-street , last Saturday week; I got up a little before six, and lest the prisoner in bed; my cloaths were in the room, I put the coat out to be cleaned; I went out with my dray, and when I came home the things were gone; I found them afterwards in Goodman's-fields.
I lost the things, mentioned in the indictment, from the Queen's-head; I left them lying in the room where I slept, the next room to Burrin; they were in the room when I went to bed, and I did not see them after; the prisoner slept in the same room that Burrin did.
I keep the Queen's-head; the soldier (the prisoner) is quartered upon me, these two men lodge with me; they informed me they were robbed, and they suspected the soldier; I found the property in possession of Mr. Dawson, an officer, on Monday the 28th of March last.
(Produces the property). On Saturday, the 26th of last month, about half past seven in the morning, I saw the prisoner offering these things to sale in Rosemary-lane; I had a suspicion of him, and took him before a Magistrate.
This jacket, coat, and hat, are mine.
I did not find this hat upon the prisoner; but when he came before the Magistrate the second time he had it on his head.
All these things are my property.
I brought these things out of the country; I was down on surlough for a fortnight, at Christmas, and I brought them up with me.
