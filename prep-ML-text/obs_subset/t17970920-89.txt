- I am a linen-draper in Fleet-street : On the 16th of this month, the prisoner at the bar came in, and wanted to buy some handkerchiefs; I attended him myself, and shewed him several; he agreed for one, desired I would cut it off, and he would call for it in a few minutes; I did not cut it off; he had a short jacket on, upon his turning round to go out, I discovered between his thighs a piece of silk handkerchiefs folded up; I called to him, but he did not come; I called stop thief, sent a man after him, and he was brought back with the handkerchief.
Who was in the shop besides you?
Two servants, besides myself and a customer.
Are they attending here?
No.
Then, for what you know, they night have seen it?
They say not.
- I am shopman to Mr. Thompson; I saw the prisoner come in; Mr. Thompson came over the counter as soon as he was gone, and called stop thief; I went after him; he ran down Bride-lane; I observed the silk handkerchiefs in his hand as he was running, there were four of them in one piece; in turning round Bridge-court, he fell down, and I detected him; I took the prisoner, and had him back to my master, Mr. Thompson; I delivered the handkerchiefs to my master, and got a constable.
I was sent for to take charge of the prisoner; Mr. Thompson gave him into my charge, with the handkerchiefs.
These are my handkerchiefs, they have my mark upon them; they are the same that I delivered to the constable.
These are the same handerchiefs that I took from the prisoner.
I have lost one arm, and the use of great part of one side of me, that it is totally impossible I should be able to hold them between my thighs.
