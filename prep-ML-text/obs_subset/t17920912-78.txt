I am wife of John Stillwell ; we keep a chandler shop and greenshop ; I lost two silver tea spoons the 6th of July; I went for a pail of water, I heard a foot in the shop, and I returned immediately, the prisoner was there, and asked how I sold my potatoes, and I immediately missed my tea spoons; I said you do not want potatoes, you are a thief, you have taken my spoons off the table; and I laid hold of him, and he got away, and I cried stop thief! he was taken; I saw the prisoner's hand in his pocket, and I picked one spoon up in the passage.
I only produce two spoons I had from the prosecutrix; I know nothing of the robbery.
I am a clerk at a banking house; I took the prisoner in Jewin-street, on the 6th of July; he threw the spoons out of his hand, one of them I picked up, and gave to the prosecutrix, the other was thrown behind some shutters, and she got it herself.
