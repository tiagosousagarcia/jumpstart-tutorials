I am the wife of Charles Cotter ; the prisoner nursed me; she slept in the same room with me and my husband; I waked about seven in the morning, and saw the prisoner dressing herself; my hat and cloak were hanging up; the prisoner went out, and I missed the things mentioned in the indictment; I went after the prisoner, and found her; but I never recovered any of my things.
The prisoner came to my house, dressed in a hat and cloak, and handkerchief, that, by the subscription, were the same that Cotter had lost.
I lived with that woman about eleven weeks; I lived a very unhappy life; the man and she used frequently to quarrel, and fight, all hours of the night, not being married to the man, as they have both declared; she used to get up in the night, and pick his pocket, and it was laid to me. On Saturday, the next morning, I went out, and said nothing to them; going to my cousin's, in Bishopsgate-street, I met a young woman, that lives at the Seven Dials, who lent me a hat and cloak. They would swear my life away for a glass of gin.
