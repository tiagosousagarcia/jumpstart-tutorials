On the 13th of May, about three o'clock in the evening, I took off my coat in Gardiner's-lane, York-street , two serjeants were having a dispute; I put the coat upon the step of No. 8; I saw the prisoner take it, but did not think she was going to steal it; when the dispute was ended, I went to look for the woman, and she was gone; I found her near the Blue Anchor; I asked her for the coat, and she said she had given it to a soldier of the first regiment; I gave her into the custody of an officer.
I was going of an errand; I saw a crowd of people fighting; a drummer threw the coat out to me, and desired me to take care of it. GUILTY , aged 50.
