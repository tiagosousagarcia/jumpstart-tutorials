I keep a publick-house in New-street, St. James's . On the 31st of August the prisoner came to my house, between seven and eight o'clock at night; he went backwards; the fiddle and bow were in the parlour, the door of which opens into the passage that leads into the yard; I saw them there not a minute before the prisoner came in; I missed them as soon as he was gone; I pursued him, but could not find him; I took him about an hour after at a publick-house, and charged a constable with him. I was informed by a person that the prisoner went into the Coach and Horses, a publick-house in Shug-lane; I went there, and the woman of the house delivered to me the violin and bow.
I am servant to Mr. Hardy; the prisoner came into our house; he called for no liquor; he went backwards to the yard; I saw the fiddle and bow lie on the table in the parlour, not half a minute before; he came back in less than two minutes, and went away, and he did not call for any thing; I saw him have the fiddle and bow under his right arm.
This gentleman came to another publick-house where I was, and asked for his fiddle; I told him I knew nothing of it.
