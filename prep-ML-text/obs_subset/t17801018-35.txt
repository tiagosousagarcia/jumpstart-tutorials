I am the wife of William Portal ; we keep a linen-draper's shop . The prisoner came about five o'clock on Tuesday the 17th of this month to our house, and asked to see some muslin handkerchiefs. I shewed her some. She said they were very coarse, and desired to see some kenting ones. I took a bundle out of the counter, and shewed her some. I had two more customers at that time in the shop; I did not mistrust her. She asked me the price of the handkerchiefs; I told her three shillings. She said she would give me two shillings and fourpence. I refused the two shillings and fourpence. As she t urned the corner of the door-way to go out, I saw the handkerchiefs behind her, under her arm. I called to my son to run after her. He ran out and brought her back with seven kenting handkerchiefs.
I saw the prisoner in the shop; I ran out on my mother's calling to me; I took her seven doors from the shop , and found seven handkerchiefs under her arm. I brought her back into the shop.
My witnesses are not here.
