- On Saturday, the 5th of August, about seven o'clock in the evening, going along the Strand, directly opposite St. Clement's church , I had a sudden sensation that my pocket was picked; I instantly turned round, and observed the prisoner at the bar not above a yard from me, whom I immediately seized, and took from under his coat, on his right hand side, my silk pocket handkerchief; I secured him immediately; when I took the handkerchief from him, he ran across to the rails of St. Clement's church, but I never lost sight of him; I was within about a yard of him all the way; he sell down at St. Clement's church gate; I then secured him, and carried him to Bow-street, and he was committed by Mr. Floud, (produces the handkerchief) ; this is my handkerchief.
- I am a wharfinger; the prisoner was, when I knew him, in the pawnbrokering line with Mr. Rodbard, Broadway, Blackstiars, he is now dead; he lived with me three years; I have seen him frequently at his father's house; he has lived with Mr. Wilkin's, in Tooley-street, and Mr. Barnes, in Bermondsey-street, in the same prosession.
