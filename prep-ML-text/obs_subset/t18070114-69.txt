I am in partnership with William Joshua Cook , we are iron founders and machine makers ; the prisoner was a labourer and lately a carter in my employ.
I am superintendant to Messrs. Cook. On the 26th of December, as the prisoner was going out of the door, I heard something rattle, I went to the door, I perceived the prisoner going a contrary direction to where he lives; I called to him, he made no answer, I pursued him; I saw that he had something in his hand, I asked him what he was going to do with them files, he said to make a fire grate, he hoped I would not take any notice of it; I told him I could not discharge my duty, if I did not. I produce the files, they are the property of my employers.
