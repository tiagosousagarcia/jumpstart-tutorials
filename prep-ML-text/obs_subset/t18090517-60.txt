I am a shoemaker , I live in St. Catherine's-court, Tower-Hill . On the evening of the 12th April I missed a pair of boots which had been hung outside of the window for sale.
I am a carpenter; I live next door to Mr. Varney. On the 12th of April, near five o'clock in the afternoon, I saw the prisoner turn up the boots and look at them. I did not see him take them away; I saw them in his hand.
I saw the prisoner take them off the place where they were hanging; he turned them up to look at the soles, and then he looked round to see whether any body saw him, and then he ran away; I am sure the prisoner is the man.
You never went and told the man, did you
. No; I thought the man had been in and paid for the boots.
On the 15th of April, I took the prisoner up; he said if I named the day the boots were stolen he could tell me where he had been at work: he said he worked on board a ship at St. Catherine's; he could not tell me the ship's name.
How were the boots found
They were exposed to sale in Rosemary-lane.
A deaf and dumb man that works for me saw them in Rosemary-lane; he came to me and wrote it down on the slate; then I wen there and saw them exposed for sale.
I saw the deaf and dumb man soal and heel them.
I know nothing at all of them. They fetched the woman of the shop in Rosemary-lane, and the daughter to prove that I was the man; no, my dear, said they, this was not the man; this man is a man and a half, the other man was a little man; I know nothing at all of it no more than my dying day.
