I am a hair-dresser , No. 26, Buckingham-street ; the prisoner was a servant out of place, he used to call upon me to ask me after places. On Monday, the 10th of October, about a quarter after nine in the morning, I went out, the things were then in the back parlour; I returned at noon, and missed them about four o'clock; I went round to the pawnbrokers and found them.
I know nothing at all of the things, neither did I take them out of the house.
