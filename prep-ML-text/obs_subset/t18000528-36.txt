I am a publican: Last Friday morning, in St. Martin's-le-Grand, I saw the prisoner surrounded by a number of boys pelting him; I enquired what was the matter, and was informed he had stole a pot; I went to Mr. Litchfield's directly, he desired me to detain him; I went after him and stopped him; he said he did not steal it, it tumbled into his breeches somehow or other, he did not know how.
I got information that the prisoner had a pot in his breeches; I went up to him, and he said he would knock any body down; and a great many people came round, and then he took the pint pot out of his breeches, and held it up, and said, I do not want the pot, I was going to find out who it belonged to, only I could not see to read.
I am a Marshalman: I was going past, and had the pot delivered to me.
This is the same pot.
This is my pot.
I picked it up all over dirt.
