- I am a silk-weaver and keep a shop to sell silk in Jewry-street, Aldgate : The prisoner and another man came in under presence of buying a silk handkerchief, on the 6th of January, between seven and eight o'clock in the evening, the prisoner said he should like a red one, I shewed him some; he asked about the colours, and a person outside the shop, in the street, said \"have a red one, have a red one,\" then I shewed some yellow ones, and the same voice said
\"have a yellow one, have a yellow one,\" I was going to open the piece, but the prisoner would do it himself; another young man then came in, and after looking at them, the prisoner said he would call in teh morning as he could not see the colours at night. I had some mistrust, and as they went out of the door I lifted up the piece, and missed five handkerchiefs of a red piece, six of another, and we odd ones. I pursued them and saw them running, some in the horse road and some in the too road; I called out stop thief, and a gentleman stopped the prisoner, who I had not lost sight of-I have never seen the handkerchiefs since. A.constable took the prisoner in charge, who offered all the money he had about him for his liberty.
I am a constable, and took the prisoner in charge; he said he was innocent, and offered three or four shillings sooner than get into trouble.
I know nothing of it. I never saw the other persons who were in the shop before they were standing at the window when I went in.
