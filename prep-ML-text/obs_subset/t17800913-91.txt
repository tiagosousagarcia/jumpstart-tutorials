I live in Tothil-street . The prisoner was my servant . The things mentioned in the indictment were stolen out of my box; I had opened my box while she was present. I went down stairs and left her in the room; she brought me the key of the door down. I missed the things; in an hour after she went out and never came back again. We took her up about a week after. She confessed the fact. She had the buckle then upon her.
The prisoner pawned this sheet with me on the 10th of July, for three shillings in the name of Mary Brown . She said it was her property.
It is nothing but spite and malice, I know nothing of it.
