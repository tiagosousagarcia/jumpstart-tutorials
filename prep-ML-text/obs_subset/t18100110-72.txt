My husband's name is Thomas Patterson .
When did you lose these things
I cannot say; I was out from home; I am in the habit of going out a nursing. They were pledged in August, in December I found they had been pledged. The prisoner had lodged in the house; she was in the poor house; I went and accused her of taking them; she said she had taken them and pledged them at Mr. Hills; she had destroyed the duplicates.
I am servant to Mr. Hill, a pawnbroker. A sheet, two quilts, and a bed gown were pawned at our shop on the 11th of August; the young man is gone away that took them in.
I did do it; I was in great distress; I took no more than what is laid before you.
