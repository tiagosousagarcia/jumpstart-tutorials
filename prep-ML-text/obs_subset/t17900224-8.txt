I live at No. 30, German-street : on the 4th of February, I was in the wash-house, and employed the prisoner as a washerwoman , at two shillings and six-pence a day; I stood close by her in the wash-house, and she took two shirts out of the clothes-basket; one was mine, and the other was one I was entrusted with: this was between two and three in the afternoon; when she went out of the wash-house, I missed them; I never saw the shirts, till I saw the officer who took her: the officer came to me immediately.
I am an officer of Litchfield-street; on the 4th of this month, I was coming through Piccadilly; I saw the prisoner with a man, and had got these two shirts with a man; I listened to hear what she was going to do with them; I asked her what she was going to do with them? she said, what was that to me; I then brought her up to the office: she told me where she lodged, from whence I learned where she had been to work: I carried the shirts with me to the prosecutrix: the woman had a hearing, and was committed; they have been in my possession ever since.
I was very much in liquor when I did it.
