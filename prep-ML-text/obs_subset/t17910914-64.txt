I am a housekeeper, the woman was my servant ; I got up at six o'clock on the 29th of August, the first thing I missed was my watch, on Monday morning I had last seen it hang on the side of the mantle-piece in my bed-room, and all the articles in the indictment, besides many more; I recovered them again at the pawnbroker's about three weeks after I lost them.
I am servant to a pawnbroker, on Saturday, the 10th of September, the prisoner pawned an apron and a muslin handkerchief; I knew her person; on Tuesday the 13th she pawned another apron.
I am a pawnbroker; the prisoner pawned a watch the 30th of August with me, and two silver spoons. (Produced.)
I am a pawnbroker's servant; I produce a shift, a coloured apron, and a neckcloth, the apron and neckcloth were pawned the 26th of August, and the shift the 6th of September.
I am a relation of the prosecutor's; Mrs. Northover sent for me, and I went to Bow-street, and saw the prisoner searched, and there was a petticoat and half shawl taken from her, (that was this day week,) and several duplicates, which led to these articles. (Produced.) Two applied to the things pawned at Allen's, three to Garude's, and one to Wilson's.
I can swear to the shawl, by some of the edge of the fringe worn off; I can swear to the flannel petticoat, for I pieced it.
I beg the mercy of the Court.
