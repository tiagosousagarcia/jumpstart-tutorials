I live in Clarges-street, Piccadilly : On Friday the 20th of August, the prisoner brought me from the Hay-market Theatre, and in the morning, he wished my servant to follow him to Bond-street, to his lodgings, saying, he would send me some money; she came up stairs, and I asked her why she did not follow him; she said, he told her to go to the Thatched-house Tavern, and she would find him; I would not let her go, and I went into my bed-room; I looked into my box, and on the toilet, and missed a pair of gold ear-rings, a gold pin, a gilt locket, and a shawl, which I had placed on the trunk, near the bed; I did not see any thing of the prisoner till the 24th of September, when I took him as I was coming out of Convent-garden Theatre; the duplicate of the pin and ear-rings were found in his apartment; he denied having robbed me, and wished to make his escape; I took him to the watch-house, and afterwards he was taken to Great Marlborough-street; I am positive he is the person.
I am servant to Miss Ithier; and let the prisoner in about twelve o'clock in the evening of the 20th of August, I am sure he is the person: I let him out in the morning, and he said I was to follow him to the Thatched-house Tavern, but not immediately; by my mistress's order I did not go.
My son is a pawnbroker, and I was minding his shop: On the 21st of August, the prisoner came in and pledged a pair of gold ear-rings, and a pin, in the name of Edwards, for 5s. I am certain of his person.
I am an officer, and have a duplicate of the ear-rings and pin, which I found in the prisoner's box, at his lodgings, at the corner of Tom's-court, Bird-street, Grosvenor-square.
