I am a pawnbroker; I took in a shirt and neck-handkerchief; the prisoner brought them the 3d of March, he said he was a valet; he has frequently brought things and redeemed them again.
There was a shirt pledged with me; I know nothing of the prisoner, only the description given by my servant answers to the prisoner.
