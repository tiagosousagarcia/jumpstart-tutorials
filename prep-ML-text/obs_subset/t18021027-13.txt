I am foreman to Messrs. Fields, No. 119. Lower Thames-street; I packed the articles stated in the indictment, on Monday last, in a box, for the West-Indies; I marked it K.W.H. I delivered it to our carman, on Monday evening, to go to No. 79, in Basinghall-street, with three other boxes; the carman is here.
I am carman to Messrs. Fields: On Monday evening last I received four boxes and two bags, from Mr. Martin, to go to No. 79, Basinghall-street; I was going along the Old Jewry , about half past six o'clock, and saw a man behind the cart, I drew back, he found me coming and dropped the box on the ground and ran away; I cried stop thief, and picked up the box; the prisoner was immediately stopped close to the horses head; the prisoner is the same man; I took the box to No. 11, Old Jewry, and delivered it to a constable.
I am servant to a hosier, in Lothbury; I was in the Old Jewry; I heard stop thief cried; I was on the off side of Mr. Field's cart, and saw the prisoner drop a box; he came round on the off side of the horse; I ran across the way and stopped him directly; I took him into Mr. Dixon's shop, in the Old Jewry, and a constable was sent for; the prisoner and the box were given in charge to the constable.(The constable produced the box, which was identified by Martin and Allen.)
I am an attorney; I heard the cry of stop thief; I saw the prisoner at the horses head, making for the corner of a court; I immediately collared him; Mr. Ashwin collared him nearly at the same time; I did not see him with the box.
I am innocent of the charge.
