On the 13th of December, between four and five o'clock in the afternoon, I caught the prisoner taking wool out of a bag, between Cox and Hammond's Quay , I saw him stop and pull it out of the bag of wool that was lying there under my care; I am a servant at the waterside; I took charge of him, I caught him with the wool upon him; there was some in his hat, some in his breeches, and the rest in his hand.
I am one of the watchmen upon the wharf: I was called by Mr. Hall to assist in securing the prisoner; I took the wool from him, and gave him to the constable; I saw some wool fall from his trowsers; I took him to the Compter, and there I found secreted in his hat a quantity more.
I beg mercy of the Court.
