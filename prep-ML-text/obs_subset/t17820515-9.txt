I keep the Fountain, in Wych-street . Mr. Haynes informed me two men had carried a table out of my yard; I looked into the back-room, and missed a mahogany dining-table; it was about half after eight at night; Mr. Haynes and I ran out; and, about 200 yards from my house, we took the prisoner with my table on his back.
A man employed me to carry the table for him.
