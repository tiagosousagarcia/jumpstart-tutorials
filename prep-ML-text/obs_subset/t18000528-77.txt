Mr. James Pitcairn is on his passage to India, his great coat was left at my house; I know nothing of the loss.
I live near Mr. Simpson's, in Somerset-street ; my little boy lives opposite Mr. Simpson's: In consequence of his information, I went after the prisoner, I overtook him in Hyde-Park, near Grosvenor-gate, he had the great coat upon him, (produces it) ; I told him that great coat did not belong to him, he had better take it back to the parties that it did belong to; he said the great coat was his own, what did I mean by that; I told him the coat did not belong to him, certainly, and he must go back; he said he would not go back, but I forced him to go back; I took him to Mr. Simpson's, and shewed him the great coat.
This is Mr. Pitcairn's great coat; he desired it to be left with me, I had worn it one day, it rained and I slipped it on; I know it to be his coat.
On the 23d of May, I saw the prisoner go into Mr. Simpson's, between nine and ten o'clock in the morning; he made two attempts before he brought any thing out, and the third time he brought out a coat under his own coat; I did not see what it was, but I supposed it to be a coat; he had not any thing under his coat when he went in; the door had been left half open by the servant.
I bought the coat of a Jew, and gave one shilling and sixpence for it; I am totally innocent of the robbery.
