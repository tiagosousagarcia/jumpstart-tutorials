I am Mr. Jerdein's coachman. On the 29th of May last, I lost a coat from the coach-house. About twelve at noon I saw the prisoner and another man in a sailor's dress: after I had put the coach in the coach-house, I went up to shift myself, and I came down and missed the coat.
I overtook the prisoner at the bar with the coat on him, and took him, and delivered it to the coachman.
I was coming over Moorfields, and I saw a lad chuck it away, and I picked it up; and I went back into the stable-yard, and there was a woman said I was not the person who took it.
