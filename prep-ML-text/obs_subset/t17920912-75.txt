I saw the prisoner walking very heavy; I followed him into Mrs. Field's shop; I saw him shug up his waistcoat, and take out a piece of lead from his waistband, and lay it down in the shop; then he went to the warehouse, and came out a second time; we took him into custody.
I found a piece of lead, 37 lb, under the waistband of the prisoner's breeches: says I, whose property; says he, I am my own master. I took him to the plumber's shop; there I found 1 cwt. and 3-qrs. more.
I was employed by the India Company; the prisoner worked with me six weeks, and two or three days; these three pieces are part of the lining of the reservoir; we had finished the building, and this new lead was the lead of the reservoir. I opened the pieces at the mansion-house, before the man had his examination, and the pieces are the exact length.
I see this lead; this lead never was from the reservoir at all; we had no such lead as that come from the reservoir at all; we have no such sized piece as that.
I lived at Mr. Goodwin's till yesterday, twelve o'clock.
Look at that lead, and see whether there is any way of identifying it.
I cannot swear to that lead.
Do you think it possible now, for people on their oaths to identify it?
I do not think they can with a safe conscience.
What sort of lead is that?
It is sheet lead.
Upon your oath was there not such lead used?
There was sheet lead used at the reservoir.
