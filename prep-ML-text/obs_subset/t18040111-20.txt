I am a grocer and confectioner in Princes-street, Leicester-fields ; the prisoner was my servant : On the 9th of January I gave my servants a supper; after the rest were gone, I observed the prisoner go twice into the confectionary; the second time I heard a rustling of paper among the confectionary goods; he came up stairs, and I opened the door myself, and let him out; I watched him about fifty yards, left the door on the jar, and went down into the confectionary, and found a parcel at the top of the area; I immediately ran up stairs, and found him in the act of taking the parcel from the area; I called the watchman, and he was taken; it was sometime before we could find them, but at last found them upon him. - The property produced.)
