I work for Mess. Lucas and Spencer, they are lamp-contractor s; on the 15th of January last I was in Newman-street, Oxford-road , between the hours of one and two, I was trimming the lamps, I was up the ladder, I left the kettle in the street about one hundred yards from where I was at work, on the foot pavement by the rails of a house, I went back again and my kettle was gone, I had not seen it for about three quarters of an hour, when I saw it again, it was at the watch-house the same evening, and the prisoner was in custody; there was about five quarts of oil in it.
I have worked for Mess. Lucas and Spencer years; I was coming from dinner, I live in King-street, Seven Dials, their shop is in Phoenix-street, St. Giles's, about half after two o'clock; I went into White Lion-street, which is the way to the shop, and I met the prisoner with the kettle in his hand, coming towards me; it is better than a quarter of a mile, half a mile I should imagine; when he saw me, he immediately put the kettle on his head, I was in the dress of a lamp-lighter, in a greasy jacket; I am perfectly satisfied he saw me, he was about seven yards off, I walked up to him and met him, and I asked him whose work he was going to do, and who he was going to help; he then gave me a good many sawcy answers, which induced me to think he had stolen the kettle; he told me cheeks, that was the word he said; I followed him across the Seven Dials into Short's Gardens, at the corner of Belton-street in Short's Gardens; he took the pot off his head, and set it down under a grocer's window; I then passed him up Short's Gardens, he then came out into the middle of the street, and beckoned as if to somebody, I cannot say whether he saw me or not; I then turned myself about in order to come at Short's Gardens again towards him, he had then taken the kettle up again, and was coming towards me with the kettle on his head; I laid hold of him and said, now young man, where are you going with that kettle? he told me to ask his a - ; I still held him by the collar; I said, you rascal, I believe you have stolen this kettle, it is my master's property; (I knew it to be so at first by a particular bruise) he then said his brother-in-law gave it to him; he refused to tell me his name, I took him to the watch-house; says I, that is where your brother-in-law lives you rascal, and he was committed; I left the kettle at the watch-house till six o'clock; I took off the cover and found oil in it.
I never saw the man; my Lord and Gentlemen of the July, I belong to a ship at Deptford, and it is a general rule for a man to find a bondsman for his two months allowance; my bondsman lives in New Bond-street, he promised me; I have a wife and family, two small children, and I thought the few pounds would be of service to her; I was coming from Carnaby-market, and met a man who had been pressed along with me, his name is Jonathan Price , he asked me to give him some beer, and we had some beer and gin; I gave him the duplicate of a watch I had in pawn to sell, and he went out, and staid above two hours, and I said to the landlord, I am afraid this young man has tricked me, and I took this kettle and went to see for him; I saw him go into a house, and I beckoned to him, and this man took me.
