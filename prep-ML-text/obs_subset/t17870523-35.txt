I am a shoe-maker , in Cow-lane ; the prisoner came into my shop on the 1st of May; he wanted a pair of child's shoes; I was in the room behind the shop; I heard somebody move the steps in the shop, and he reached a pair of shoes off the shelf and put them between his legs; my man's back was turned while he was reaching the shoes he asked for, I came into the shop and asked for the shoes he took off the shelf; I sent for a constable and I saw the shoes drop from him.
The prisoner had these two pair of shoes, which we suspected he had stolen some where else; they are not the prosecutor's; I have had them ever since.
I went into the shop to buy a pair of girl's shoes; I never stole a pair of shoes in my life.
