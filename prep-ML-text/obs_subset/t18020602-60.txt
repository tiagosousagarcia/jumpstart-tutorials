I lodge at the Fleece, in Little Windmill-street ; I left the ar ticles in question, in a box in my bed-room; about two o'clock on Wednesday, the 5th of May, the prisoner was on the bed in the next room; he has been discharged from the marines ; about four o'clock I saw the prisoner go out from the door, but did not see whether he had a bundle or not; I received information from the servant maid, in consequence of which I went after him, and took him with the property upon him; I brought him back, and he was committed; he offered me a glass of any thing I pleased to drink, and to say nothing about it; I have had the things ever since.
Was your box locked?
I cannot say, the key was in the lock; they are all my property.
I am a servant at the Fleece; I went up stairs between four and five in the afternoon, and met the prisoner coming down with these things in his hand, tied up in a handkerchief; he said I am going off, I shall bid you good bye; I suspected him, and told Harper of it, and he missed his property.
This man asked me to fetch these things down for him, and I went to the door to look for him, when he came up and took me into custody.
