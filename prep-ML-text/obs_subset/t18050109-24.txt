I lost a ring about two years back; it was made for Mr. Dean, it came to be altered; there came two women to ask for the ring; I put out the drawer that contained the rings for them to choose the ring; they cried, this is it, and this is it, and so I supposed they took it; I cannot swear to the day of the month; my husband was not at home when it was lost.
I am a constable; I was sent for about the 12th of December to Barnard Benjamin 's, Golden-lane; the prisoner and her daughter were fighting, but when I had got there they were not fighting then, and there was a woman named Johanna, who said to me, look at that woman's finger, she has got a ring that belongs to a silversmith, opposite the butter-shop in Smithfield-bars; I took it off her finger, and took her to the watchouse, and then went to Mr. Whitford with the ring; he said it was his ring, that he had made it for Mr. Dean, who keeps the Bull's-head, Smithfield, about two years ago.
I know that ring to be my property; I know nothing more about it.
