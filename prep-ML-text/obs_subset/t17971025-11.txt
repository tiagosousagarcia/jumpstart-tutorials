Last Sunday night I lost a guinea and a half; I went to bed about ten o'clock at night, I put it into a piece of paper in my waistcoat pocket, to give to my mistress; the prisoner slept with me that night, and when I went to give it to my mistress I missed it, and I got a constable, and when he was going to be searched I saw him let it drop.
I knew the paper that it was wrapped up in; he said he only took it out of a joke.
There were three of us in the bed; I picked up a piece of paper, I did not know what was in it.
