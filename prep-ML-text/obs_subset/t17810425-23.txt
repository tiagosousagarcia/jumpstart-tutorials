I am a broker in Brook-street , Grosvenor-square; I had a picture of fruit and flowers hanging up on the outside of my shop in the street for a twelvemonth; I had a fellow to it; I valued the pair at three guineas; on the 14th of February the picture was missing early in the morning; ten days after that, I had an information that led me to suspect the prisoner; and the picture was found in his lodgings.
Upon the 14th of February I was in my own house, which is opposite Mr. Mason's; I saw the prisoner take the picture from Mr. Mason's house; he walked up and down the street two or three times before he took it; then he walked away; I went to the boy, and asked him if he had sold the picture; he said, he had not; the boy and I pursued the prisoner, but lost sight of him; I believe he went into a court.
On suspicion of another charge, the prisoner's lodgings were searched about four or five days after he had been in custody; the picture was found in his room, over the chimney.
I leave my defence to my counsel.
