I live No. 6, in Thanet-place, Temple-bar . On the 25th of this month I went from my dwelling about nine; in a few minutes after I was fetched back, and the prisoner was in custody.
I live at Mr. Cook's. On Sunday last, the 25th of March, I heard a noise on the stairs; I was on the kitchen stairs; and a gentleman went up with me; it was about twenty minutes after nine; we went up stairs into the bed-room, and the gentleman lifted up the vallances of the bed, and the prisoner was under the bed; that is the man.
I lodge next door to the prosecutor; and there was an alarm by the servant of thieves; I lifted up the bed clothes in the bed-room, and the prisoner was there.
My master and mistress went out about nine on Sunday evening. I was putting some flowers in water; and I told my fellow servant I heard a rustling, and within three stairs of the kitchen; I went across the way and called the maid; and at the next door a gentleman came and went up stairs; when I shut up the windows there was a coat on one of the dining-room chairs, and a hat and sheet on the table; they were gone; all the doors and windows were shut; I saw afterwards the staircase window open, with the print of a man's feet on the stone-work; at twenty minutes after nine I went up stairs, and saw that window shut; nobody went up after me till the gentleman.
I have nothing to say, only they say a great deal false in it.
Why, was not you found under the bed?
Yes; but that young woman was not present as she says.
