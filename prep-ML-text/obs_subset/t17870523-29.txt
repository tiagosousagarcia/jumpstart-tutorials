What age are you?
Just turned of fourteen; about eight at night, on the 20th of March last, I was robbed at the corner of Ducking-pond-lane, Whitechapel-road ; It was just dark, it was the prisoner that robbed me; I was coming down Whitechapel-road, and at the door going round the corner, I saw the prisoner come from behind me; he came before and hit me in the face; I had a black eye for two or three days; and took the bundle from under my arm and run up the lane; I have frequently seen him about the neighbourhood, but never spoke to him, or played with him; there was a cotton gown in the bundle, tied up in a handkerchief, it was my mother's gown; my father is here; it was just under a lamp; I am sure it was him and nobody else.
I am father to the last witness; I was at home, and my son came crying into the house, and said, this prisoner had robbed him, and described his dress, and he was taken the next day according to the description; I never got the gown again; I know the gown very well.
What is it worth?
It is laid at twelve shillings, but it is worth a good deal more; it cost twenty-seven or twenty-eight shillings.
Mr. Earl came to me, being an officer; on the 21st of March, I took him on Tower-hill at a place he frequented, where boys meet to gamble; I found nothing on him; I have enquired about his age; the neighbours tell me he is about eighteen; he lives just at the back of where I live.
I was never nigh the place at the time; I was on board a ship at the same time; my friends are here; they were here yesterday; I was fourteen last May.
