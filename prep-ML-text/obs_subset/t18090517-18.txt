I am a hosier , No. 22, Wood-street . I lost these things on Friday last, about five o'clock. As I was sitting in my accompting house, Samuel Stratton brought the prisoner back to my warehouse; I took the bundle from under the prisoner's arm. I asked him how he came to take the bundle out of the warehouse, he said it was distress; he was out of employ, and begged me to let him go; I sent for a constable and gave him in charge.
I am warehouseman to Robert Barthrop , and Richard Railton . On Friday the 12th instant, I was in the warehouse; I saw the prisoner carying the jackets out of the warehouse; they lay near the door. I immediately acquainted Mr. Barthrop, and pursued him. I took him in Lad-lane; I brought him back to the warehouse. He surrendered the jackets into Mr. Barthrop's hands.
I am a man that has brought up a large family; I have experienced a deal of family trouble; so much so, that I am in a derangement of mind at times.
