I am a Blackwell-Hall factor , in Basinghall-street : I am in partnership with Joseph Clementson , and Thomas Borrodaile, Mr. Clementson is the only partner who lives in the house; I can only prove the property.
I am clerk to the prosecutors: On the 23d of September, about three o'clock in the afternoon, I saw the prisoner in the warehouse, with a piece of red cloth in a bag across his shoulder; I called to him, he threw it from his shoulder, and endeavoured to make his escape; I pursued him and took him, I knew nothing of him before; I don't know whether the warehouse-door was open or not; I cut a piece out of the cloth that I might know it again.
I saw the prisoner drop the scarlet cloth in the passage, and make his way out into the street, I did not pursue him; I took up the cloth, and Mr. King pursued him.( William Mead , a constable, produced the cloth, which was identified by Brogden.)
I have nothing to say.
