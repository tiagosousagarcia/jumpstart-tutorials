I keep the Golden-lion in Fore-street, Cripplegate : On the 17th of October , the prisoner and Bonnein, and Pearson, were all at my house together, about eight o'clock in the morning; the conversation turned upon the Aldermen and Common Counsel presenting a petition to his Majesty; Bonnein, who was acquitted last night, d- d the Lord-Mayor, Alderman, and Common Council, and the King and Parliament; to which Hillier said, so say I, d-n the King and, the Parliament; at which Pearson, asked Bonnein, if a foreign enemy were to land in the country whether he would join them; Bonnein's reply was, d-n his eyes and limbs if he would no; Hilliar seemed rather shocked at that, and said, no, he would not do that; Bonnein was, very drunk, Hilliar had been one of the watchmen, that had had Bonnein in costody over night for a riot in the street, and Pearson, was on of the watchmen.
what kind of a man is he?
I do not know.
I know no more than what Tanner has said; Hillair said he would not join a foreign enemy; I did not perceive that he was very much intoxicated, but I have heard since that he was for he had been drinking gin, and I cannot tell what.
I was sent for to Mr. Tanner's and there was Bonnein and Hilliar there: Tanner gave me charge of them; they were both in as great a state of intoxication as ever I saw men.
Gentlement of the Jury, intoxication is certainly no defence; but if you think that this was a drunken conversation, they not knowing what they said, you will acquit the defendant; but if you think this man was of a wicked disposition, and wishing to overturn the Government, to be sure you will find him guilty.
