I am shopman to Mr. Edwards, pawnbroker , Clare-street . On the 18th of December, in consequence of information from the next witness, I pursued the prisoner four doors off, and took this gown from her; I pushed her into the shop, Mr. Edwards charged a constable with her. The gown was worth ten shillings.
I saw the prisoner take the gown off the hooks at Mr. Edwards's door, I told Mr. Paul of it, he took it from her.
I did not go away with the gown, I took it down, and went into his own place to ask the price of it, he took it away from me.
