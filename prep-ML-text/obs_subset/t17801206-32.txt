My husband's name is George Watson . We live in Carnaby-street . The prisoner took a ready furnished lodging of me about the middle of October, at two shillings a week; she lodged with me about a fortnight; then I missed several things out of the room; I asked her where they were? She said \"being in distress she had made use of them, not meaning to defraud me, but she would fetch them back.\" I sent for the watch and she was committed. I missed all the things mentioned in the indictment (repeating them) which were all let for her use with the lodging.
To Macpherson. Had she pawned any thing with you before?
Yes, from May last; I understood that she was a married woman; she said her husband was in St. George's Hospital.
My husband was in St. George's Hospital. I had not bread to eat at the time; I meant to have brought them back on the Saturday when I should have had money coming to me.
