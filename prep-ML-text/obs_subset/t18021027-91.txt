I am a pawnbroker , in Anchor and Hope-alley, St. George's in the East : On the 28th of September I lost a pair of pantaloons from the door, about five o'clock in the afternoon; I missed them, and went in pursuit; Randall and I saw the prisoner running; we pursued; the pantaloons were thrown away upon a dung wharf; I did not see the pantaloons in his possession.
I am a tallow-chandler; I saw the prisoner handling the pantaloons as they bung at the door; I went to turn some children from a little gate, and when I came back the pantaloons were gone; I told Mr. Bradley of it, and we ran after him; we got sight of him, and I saw him throw the pantaloons upon a dung-wharf; he was immediately secured.
I know nothing about it.
