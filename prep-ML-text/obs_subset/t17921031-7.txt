I am a servant to Mr. Akerman; I know the prisoner; in February 1788 the prisoner was capitally convicted; this is a certificate from Mr. Sheldon of her conviction; in June 1789 she received a conditional pardon; I delivered her for transportation, on board the Lady Juliana; she has behaved very well; I have no doubt of her person whatever.
I apprehended the prisoner in Spital-street ; she was at work in the silk way; it was on the 27th of the last month; I have made enquiries into her character, it is a very good one; she has had a child or two, I believe, since she got away.
I speak to the same effect as Mayne.
I have witnesses to my character; I have worked hard ever since I left the ship
Gentlemen, you are right; I shall certainly join my recommendation.
If you are let loose, I hope you will pursue the same line of industry which you have done according to the character you have had given you this day.
