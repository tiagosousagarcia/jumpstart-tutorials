I am clerk in the house of Thomas Coles , Richard Godwin , William Coles , and Charles Coles , No. 9, Scott's-yard, Bush-lane, Cannon-street, merchants'-broker s, and deal by commission: On the 24th of October, we had coffee in our warehouse, but the coffee supposed to be stolen, was from a vessel; I saw the coffee produced before the Magistrate by Smith, in two small bags, each containing about fifty-six pounds, marked Q. S. 77, and the other 97, on board the ship called The Four Sisters ; there was coffee of the same mark landed after the 24th of October, and those two numbers were wanting, and others also.
I am a Thames Police-officer: On the 24th of October, about seven o'clock in the evening, I was on duty near St. Catharine's-lane, and saw the prisoner, (whom I had often seen before as a waterman ), in company with another man, each with a small bag on their shoulders, coming from the water-side, walking very fast; the moon was very clear; I had a suspicion, and followed them, and they both took to their heels and ran; when I pursued the prisoner he dropped his bag, and pushed into the door of a house, and slipped the bolt upon me. I then pursued the other, whom I also knew, and he dropped his bag; I picked up the two bags, and took them into a public-house, and coming out again, I saw the prisoner pass the door and looking about; he saw me, and ran away; I pursued him, and took him into custody.
Did you see them land?
No.
You have not heard of the other man?
No. (The bags produced.)
A young man came to me at the stairs, and asked me if I would assist him to carry a bag of smuggled coffee which he had purchased, and I did; I did not know it was stolen.
