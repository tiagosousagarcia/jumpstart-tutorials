I am a cabinet-maker in Cambridge-street , I lost the wood in the indictment, and a great deal more; I got a search warrant, and found a part on John Dodd , in a house in the Gravel Pits, where he lodged; I have seen him before and spoke to him, he worked for a man that rents part of my shop, I heard he had been offering my wood for sale, then I went and got a search-warrant, I found it in the place where he was working, it was about twelve at noon on a Monday; says I, Dodd you have some wood of mine; he denied it with an oath, then he said a man gave it him to sell; I said produce that man, the wood was over his head across a beam, I suspected it to be mine, I looked at it, I have it here, I have kept it ever since, I could swear to it among ten thousand, I am certain I had not sold it or given it out to be worked up; there are ten of them, I valued them at one shilling a piece.
I belong to Justice Reid, the prosecutor came to me and told me he had been robbed, and suspected Dodd; I knew Dodd, and found him at work in Husband-street; Watkins was with us, says he to Dodd, I have lost some wood, you know where it is? says the prisoner, cannot we settle it, without going further; he said one Martin a soldier gave it him, but would not tell his regiment; he reached down eight of these things, he wanted to settle that matter with Watkins, I said he must go before a magistrate; I know nothing of the table legs.
You missed some of these things between Sunday and Monday?
Yes.
My Lord, I met this soldier, and he asked me to sell them for him, he laid the table legs on my arm, and carried the vaneers to my place where I was at work; I saw them the next day, and told him to take them away; they said that would not do, and the best way would be to burn the whole kit; I said that was not right; he said, you take care of the vaneers, and I will take care of the legs.
