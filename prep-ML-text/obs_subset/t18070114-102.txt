I am clerk to Mr. James Harman , Bush lane, he is an agent to a principal house in Birmingham. On the 5th of January, between ten and eleven o'clock in the forenoon, Jonas Taylor came into the accompting house with an order (which I have in my hand), purporting to be an order from Messrs. Welch and Newell.
Who is Welch and Newell.
They are customers of ours, they live at Anchor wharf. He told me the porter had sent him; I looked out the goods for him.
What was the value of two dozen frying pans.
Two pounds, six shillings. I followed the prisoner; instead of going to the Anchor wharf, he went up Walbrook, he met with the officer Crabb, and he was in the act of stopping him; I told Crabb what I suspected; he lodged both him and the pans in the Poultry compter.
Do you know the man at the bar.
No. I am in partnership with Mr. Newell, Anchor wharf; we never sent this order.
I am a constable. I met the prisoner, I asked him where he was going with these frying pans; he said he was going towards Blackfriar's bridge.
On Monday I was returning home along Thames street, a man like a porter says, soldier, will you go of an errand for me to No. 10, Bush lane, for a dozen of large size, and a dozen of small size frying pans. I will give you eight pence, he says; come to this place, and I will be here when you come back. I went to No. 10, Bush lane, and received the goods.
