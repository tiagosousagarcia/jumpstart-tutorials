I keep the house called the Newcastle-upon-Tyne , in Broad-street, Carnaby-market : On the 5th of February, the company staid till three o'clock in the morning, and, when they were gone, I put the candlesticks on the shelf, locked the door, and went to-bed; the next evening, at six o'clock, they were missed; having a suspicion of the prisoner, who used to come to the house, I charged her with it, and sent for a constable, who took her to the pawnbroker's where they were produced.
I am servant to the prosecutor, and having been out with my porter, I was going home, and met the prisoner coming out of my master's house, very much in liquor, and with a quantity of things, but I did not see what they were; and, about half an hour afterwards, the candlesticks were missed.
I am a pawnbroker, in Windmill-street, Golden-square, and know the prisoner very well, I took in four brass candlesticks on the 6th of February, which she brought to pledge, at nine o'clock at night. (Produces them.)
They were brought to me by a person who lives in their house, and asked me to pledge them; I never was in the house, for I gave the person the money at the door.
