I am partner with John Philpot ; on the 28th of June I lost three pieces of nine eights British callico, value ten pounds and upwards; it was brought to our house to be printed; the callico was pawned by the prisoner; I saw it there the day before.
I am an officer; on the 15th of this month I received information, the prisoner had some callico; prior to that I saw the advertisement of the prosecutor being robbed, and some hand bills; in consequence of that I apprehended her; I was informed she had pawned them at Mr. Mathews's in the Minories; I saw some callico there, I cut off a little bit, and I advertised it, and Mr. Philpot came and claimed it, and another piece I found at Mr. Windsor's a pawnbroker in the Minories, which appears to be a counter part of the other that I found at Mr. Mathews's.
I am servant to Mr. Mathews; I took in a piece of callico of the prisoner, on the 29th of June; I am sure it was her.
I am servant to Mr. Windsor, in the Minories; I have another piece of callico which I took in from the prisoner on the 29th of June.
I deal in Rosemary-lane, and have done so these fourteen years, and I bought these things of a man in the open fair; as I bought them and had no more money to turn my hand upon, I pawned them.
The act of the 18th of George the second, makes it a capital offence for stealing of goods above ten shillings, from any bleaching ground, which had been brought to be printed and exposed there.
