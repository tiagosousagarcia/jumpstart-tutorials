I am a weaver , I lost five tea-spoons from a closet; I saw the spoons that very day.
I was standing at my door between seven and eight, I saw the prisoner run by very fast, and M. Boytell's servant following him, I saw him stopped, and searched him, and found five silver tea-spoons.
These are my spoons, two are marked A. E. M. T. I am certain of them.
I live with Mr. Boytell, I had been out, and on my return I found a young man and a young woman at the door, the young woman asked me if Sally lived there, whose mother lived at Bethnal-Green; I said no; then she went out, and as he got to the threshold of the door, I heard a gingling in his pocket, I went into the kitchen, and missed five spoons; I saw them taken out of his pocket.
I am innocent of the robbery.
