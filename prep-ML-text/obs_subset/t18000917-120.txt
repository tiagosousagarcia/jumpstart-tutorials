Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am chief mate of the Albion East-India-man: On the 22d of August she lay off Blackwall ; the prisoner was a lumper on board the ship: Between six and seven o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner in the custody of Blancarn, with a quantity of pepper of the same quality with that which was on board the Albion.
Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am a tide-surveyor: On the 22d of August, between six and seven in the morning, the prisoner came on board the ship from shore, went forward into the galley, came out again with a cleaver in his hand, and said he was going to grind it for the steward of the ship, and he was to have a bottle of arrack for so doing; he got into a lighter; I asked him what he had got before him; he said, nothing at all, only the cleaver; I insisted on his coming on board again, to let me see: when he came on board I was endeavouring to feel what he had before him, and he resisted my searching him; however I did search him, and found a bag of pepper under his frock, at his left-hand side; I delivered him to Mr. Timbrell, the commanding officer; and the pepper, to the officer.
When he was on board, the hatchways were all shut down?
Yes.
I take it for granted, you never stopped a man smuggling goods on shore, who has told you that he had nothing?
It is a common thing, he said, he had it from a black man; the blacks were all called upon deck, and he was desired to pick him out, but he did not chuse it.(John Shrimpton, the officer, produced the pepper).
It was impossible for me to have stolen any pepper; I gave a black man some tobacco for it; I thought it was his own property.
Examined by Mr. Alley. I was on board the Albion from the 5th of May; the prisoner was employed by me, and was never suffered to go where the cargo was.
Was there any private trade of pepper on board that ship?
Not at that time.
