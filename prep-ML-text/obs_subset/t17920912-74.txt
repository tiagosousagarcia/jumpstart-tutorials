I am housekeeper to Mr. Cumbers; the prisoner came and asked for the housekeeper; I was up stairs; when I came down stairs, I asked him what he wanted; he was very well dressed: he said he was very much distressed, and begged I would give him something. I told him I had nothing to give him: there were several pairs of silk stockings lying on the table, and these among the rest; I can swear to the man; I talked to him five minutes; the stockings I can swear to; as soon as the prisoner went away I missed the stockings.
I am a constable; I apprehended the prisoner, and found the stockings.
I bought the stockings.
