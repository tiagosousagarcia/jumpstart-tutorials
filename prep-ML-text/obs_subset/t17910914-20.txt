I left this young person in my house to make a cloak and bonnet, she went away on the 24th of August, I saw the prisoner on the 27th; I missed my cloak and gown, and a pair of shoes of my husband's; I went to the pawnbroker's on missing my things; I found them at a pawnbroker's in Oxford-street.
I am servant to Mr. Shore, pawnbroker, Oxford-street, the prisoner, I believe, pledged a silk cloak on the 24th of August in the afternoon.
I know the cloak by the two pieces on each side.
I live at Mr. Hill's, pawnbroker; the prisoner pledged this gown with me for 6 s. on the 24th of August.
I apprehended the prisoner the 27th of last month, I searched and found the duplicates of those things.
