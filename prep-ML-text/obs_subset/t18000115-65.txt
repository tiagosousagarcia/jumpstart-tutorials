I am servant to Messrs. Thomas Aslett and Edward Asgill, proprietors of a waggon at the Oxford-arms Inn, Warwick-lane : A porter brought a chest and a bag into the yard, I helped him off his knot with it; I took the prisoner about twenty yards from where I had put the bag, with the bag under his arm; I took him in the yard last Tuesday was a week, I was helping down some wine that was going to one of the Colleges, at Oxford, when it happened; I thought it was the same bag that I had helped the porter down with, and I caught hold of him by the collar, and called out for my fellow servant to take the bag from under his arm; it con tained twenty-two pounds of tea, and six pounds of coffee, according to the permit that was in the bag; I have had it in my master's warehouse ever since.
I had been to make enquiry about a parcel, and the book-keeper told me I must go across to the tap; and in the way a great number of parcels were lying, that I could not very well get past; I took them up in my hand, and they laid hold of me, and charged the constable with me.
The prisoner is my son, I am a musical instrument maker: He was at work that very day for me, and for several days before.
