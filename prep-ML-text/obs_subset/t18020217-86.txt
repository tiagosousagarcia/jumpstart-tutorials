The prisoner was servant to us, but no entry is made in his book of the sum of 14s. 8d. received of Mr. Goodman, which he ought to have entered, Mr. Goodman having paid him.
He had to receive large sums of money, I believe?
Yes.
I will ask you, whether a person, in collecting other sums, might not forget fourteen shillings and eight-pence?
I think not.
I was applied to on the 17th of December by the prisoner for fourteen shillings and eight-pence, due to Messrs. Sills, which I paid him, and he gave me this receipt, (produces it,) which he wrote.
I leave it to my Counsel.
