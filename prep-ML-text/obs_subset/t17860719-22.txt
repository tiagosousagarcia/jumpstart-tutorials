I am wife to Joshua Champness ; we keep a public house in Fulham-fields ; I lost the things mentioned in the indictment the 9th of June, I had been washing, and hung them out to dry, I went in to dinner, and was informed a man was come out of
my garden with a bundle, I ran into the garden, and missed the things, I made an alarm, the man was pursued after and taken, and the bundle was brought to me, it contained the things mentioned in the indictment.
I pursued after and took the prisoner, I saw him put his right hand to his left side, and throw the bundle over the hedge into the garden of one John Lewis , I took him in about ten minutes; I did not see him come out of the garden, but the people cried stop thief.
I pursued the prisoner, and stopt him, and took charge of him, he said b - r your eyes, what do you want with me? he struck me with his fist, and I returned the same.
Did you see the man fling the bundle over the hedge?
No.
I was standing at my door, I saw the prisoner go by about two minutes before there was a cry of stop thief, I pursued him till he was taken at Lewis's garden, he made a bit of a stop, I thought he was going to jump over the hedge, he was not out of my sight till I caught him.
I am a constable, he was delivered into my charge with the property.
I am a waterman by trade; I had a fare to Fulham; I was walking along, and was not within three quarters of a mile of it, and they were singing out stop thief, and a parcel of people running, and I was with them for a considerable while, and several people asked me what was the matter, I said there was a thief, and one or two of them laid hold of me, and they said they supposed I was him; I never had the bundle, nor never saw it.
