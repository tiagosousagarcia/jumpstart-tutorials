I am a gardner , in Brick-lane, I let a lodging to Coge, about seven weeks since, she was to pay 3 s. per week, it was furnished, she staid about six weeks; then she left it, and left the last week's rent unpaid; she took the lodging; Joseph Booth , who I thought her husband, came home, and said he had not received his wages, and could not pay his week's rent, as his master had not paid him; I went up next morning, and found the room door half opened, I went in and discovered my loss.
The prisoner took the lodging of me, I followed my husband, and missed the things.
I know the prisoner very well; I produce two sheets and a blanket; I took them in of the prisoner at three different times, first 25th of July, one sheet 2 s 30th of July, another sheet 11th of August, a blanket (produces the sheets and blanket) I took them all in of the prisoner.
The sheets are marked A. E. the blanket has a dirty stain upon it.
I found the duplicates upon her when she was taken.
The man I lived with was out of work, and if he had been in work, he would have redeemed them.
