I live at No. 2l. Lower Belgrave-place, Pimlico ; I gave a gown and coat and a cap to Elizabeth Butler , on Monday the 28th, to wash, with several other things; she lived in the neighbourhood; I heard no more of them till Tuesday night, between nine and the o'clock; she came and asked me if I had taken my things away myself, for she had lost them, and in consequence of information I took the prisoner myself, at the Gun Tavern, Pimlico; I asked her how she came by the gown; she said it was her own; I brought her to Queen-square, Westminster, and as I took her along she pinched my arms all the way, that I thought I must have let her go.
I am a washer woman, and live at Pimlico; I had this younger woman's things to wash; the prisoner is a stranger to me; I went out washing on Tuesday morning, and left the place in care of my children.
How old are you?
I am thirteen.

What business does your mother follow?
Washing; I know the prisoner very well; she came to my mother's house on the Tuesday; my mother was gone out washing to No. 22. Belgraveplace; she had left a gown and some things upon the table, which she had to wash for this young woman; the prisoner came in, and asked if my mother was at home, about nine o'clock in the morning; she wanted me to go and fetch my mother; she said she wanted her upon particular business; she sat down by the fire; then she got up, and looked round; then she fat a good bit, and then she got up, and bid me good bye, and she came again a second time, and then there was my brother, less than me, and two little girls, and then I went out to Covent-Garden to get some elder berries, and left her there.
I bought them of a Jew in Monmouth-street.
