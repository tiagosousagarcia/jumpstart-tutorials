I am a widow , on the 6th of July, I lost a cloth coat, a jean waistcoat, a pair of velveret breeches, &c. they were taken out of a one pair of stairs closet, by a false key; the prisoner lived as servant with me, took them, as I suppose; I had been out, and left her alone in the house; on my return the street door was shut and the window fastened down, and a person got in at the window, and let me in; I went up stairs, supposing she had robbed me, and found this key in my closet-door.
I took the coat, the waistcoat, and breeches from the prisoner.
