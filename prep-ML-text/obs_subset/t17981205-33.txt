I am a cooper ; The prisoner worked for me about three years; I live in Leman-street, my shop is in White-hart-yard , Rosemary-lane; I found the property in the possession of James Seys , who took it from him, and gave it to me, he is a servant of mine.
I am a cooper: I detected the prisoner with the property, at the door of Mr. White's cooperage, he had it concealed in his breeches; I slopped him, and James Seys took it from him; it was a bag with holes in it, and some of the rivets fell out; he said it was the first time, and begged I would not publish it to his master.
You did not promise him any favour?
No, I did not.
I am a cooper: I took this property from the prisoner; I have had it from that time to this.
You cannot undertake to swear to these rivets?
No, I cannot.
What is the value of them?
Three shillings; there are six pounds of them.
Had you any rivets of that sort in your shop?
Yes; here is a sample that I took out of the bag afterwards.
Had you missed any?
Yes; I can positively swear to a quantity being missing out of the bag, because it was a fresh bag.
Do you believe them to be your's?
Yes, I do.
Where was the prisoner when you detected him?
I saw him come out of the shop, when I stopped him.
The prisoner is a cooper himself?
Yes.
And, therefore, if he was doing a job for himself, these things were necessary for him to use?
No, it was impossible.
I must leave it to the mercy of the Court; it is the first offence I ever committed in my life-time.
