I am clerk in the sugar house Gulston square , formerly belonging to John Fry , but now to the assignees who are laid in the indictment; I found this loaf of sugar concealed in a mat in the mill room, I got Henry Cordey to watch who took it away.
I am a sugar baker; on Sunday morning the 8th of June I was desired to watch who came and took it away.
Did you see who took it away.
No, it was gone on Wednesday morning, who took it I cannot tell.
I am a sugar baker; on the 11th of June about ten at night, Henry Cordey came and knocked at my gate, and told me he heard somebody going out of the gate, I went out, and about a hundred yards from the gate I met the prisoner, he had a loaf of sugar under his arm; he was standing still when I came up to him; he went back very willingly, I put the loaf of sugar in the men's room, I cannot say this is the same sugar, I did not put any mark on it.
