On the 28th of July, between twelve and one o'clock in the morning, coming by the French Horn tavern, near Red Lion-street, Holbourn , I saw the prisoner standing at the door; she asked me to give her something to drink at this tavern. We went into a room, we sat down together, she in one chair and I in another. As I sat in the chair I fell asleep. Nothing passed between us. When the waiter came in and waked me, and asked me if I had lost any thing, I had been there about half an hour; the prisoner was gone. I immediately found I had lost my watch and money. I have not got either watch or money again. The prisoner was taken up about three weeks after. I had looked at my watch just before I went in, so I am sure I had it. I had been drinking a little, but was not disguised so much as not to know what I did.
Had you any talk with the prisoner about a present?
No, nothing at all.
I was waiter at that time at the French Horn in Holbourn. I remember the prisoner coming in with Mr. Farris, it was very late in the evening, near the morning. They went into a room and ordered a negus. I saw seven or eight shillings; he gave me two shillings, and put the rest into his pocket and buttoned it up. I did not observe whether he had any watch; in about ten minutes after the prisoner went out; I went in to him and he was asleep. I then waked him and asked him if he had lost any thing, because his breeches were wide open, as well as his pockets; he searched his pockets, and said he had lost his watch and money. I took the prisoner up about six weeks after. I am sure she is the woman, I knew her before.
The prosecutor was in liquor, and he took me into the French Horn. I was at the house every night, but they did not take me up for three weeks.
To the Prosecutor. Did you give her any money?
I did not.
Was you with any other woman that night?
No.
Did you treat any other?
No.
