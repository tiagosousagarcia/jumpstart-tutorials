- I live at No. 24, Upper Berkeley-street, Portman-square ; my husband's name is John-Gordon Sinclair ; I do not live with him; my maid, who discovered the circumstance, has absconded; the prisoner was my groom ; I went to Newmarket, and had forty pounds in my house, which I put inside a table-cloth in my linen trunk; on my return, I forgot the table-cloth, and gave out the one to lay for dinner in which the notes were; I had the prisoner taken up, and the notes were found upon him.
Can you swear to the notes?
Yes.
I am shopman to Mr. Chandler, jeweller, in Leicester-square; a young man, apparently the prisoner, purchased a watch of me on the 8th of October, between nine and ten o'clock, and paid five guineas, by a tenpound note, and I gave him change, but I have not the note or number.
I am an officer, and took the prisoner into custody; on searching him, I found in his fob-pocket a metal hunting-watch, and a ribbon and key, all which he said he bought in Bath about three years before; I went and enquired, and found the watch had been purchased on the Saturday; he was then committed; I searched him on Sunday in the House of Correction; he took off his coat, and I observed he had something between his shirt and waistcoat; I took hold of his hand, which he drew out of his waistcoat, and dropped two notes, one of thirty pounds, and the other a two-pound note. I said, what do you think of it now; he said, I don't care, I broke open no locks, I picked them up.
I leave my defence to my Counsel.
