I am wife of the prosecutor; he lives in Church-street ; he lost a sheet, the 8th of March, from off a bed in our house; there was nobody up stairs but the prisoner, who came to lodge that night; we took in lodgers; I had other lodgers; some time after, the duplicate of this sheet was found on the prisoner.
Produces the sheet, received of the prisoner, on the 8th of March, for 3 s. 6 d. it was the first time I ever saw her; I believe her to be rather an unfortunate woman. (Deposed to.) The constable found the duplicate in her pocket.
The sheet belonged to myself; there is no mark upon it.
I have no mark, but I know it by my making.
