On the 26th of April, between five and six o'clock in the evening, I went into the yard; I heard somebody jump down; looking about, I saw the casement of the window had been broke open, and I found the prisoner in the yard; I laid hold of him, and called for assistance; Sarah Ash came up. I found the glass of the casement broke, and by that means it had been opened; it had been shut before. The things mentioned in the indictment were found laid all together by the window, ready to carry out; none of them had been there before.
When I came up, Mrs. Blackman had hold of the prisoner; he was then just got within the yard-door.
