- I am a stable-keeper , in Tottenham-court-road, at the Bull's-head-inn ; the prisoner was my servant, and had been about seven weeks: On the 26th of March, I entrusted him with a check to go to the Banking-house of Robarts, Curtis and Co. to get the money; I wished him to take a horse, but he said he had rather walk; I never saw him again till the 14th of August, at the Green-dragon, at Barnet; he told me, he was coming to town to settle with me, he said, he had got drunk and lost it; I said, why did not he come back to tell me; I got a constable, and he was committed, (produces the check;) I had it from Mr. Marshall, of Islington, from whom I first received it.
I am a clerk to Robarts, Curtis and Co. I paid this check on the 26th of March, I don't recollect who I paid it to.
This is the same draft I delivered to the prisoner.
