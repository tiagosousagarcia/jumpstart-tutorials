I am a mariner ; I lost my apparel and bedding; I lived with my father at the time I hired the prisoner, as a porter , on the 9th of November, to carry my hammock and bag of cloaths to Blackwall; I ordered him to carry them to the Shoulder of Mutton and Pig; when I got to Black wall, I found he had not been there; I immediately went to the house I had hired him from, the Black Boy, at Wapping New Stairs; there was an officer in the house, who went in search of the prisoner; I did not see him again till I saw him at the office, near two months after. -(Repeats the articles mentioned in the indictment). - I never found any of them again; I am sure he is the man.
I am a victualler, in Old Gravel-lane; the prisoner came to my house with a bed and a bag of cloaths; he said a sailor desired him to bring them there; he left them and came again in two or three days, and said the sailor and sent 6d. for warehouse-room, and said he was going to take them to Blackwall.
I am an officer; last Mon day was fortnight, knowing the boy, I apprehended him.
I did not make away with it; it was too heavy for me; a shipmate of mine took the bag of cloaths, and I saw no more of him; the hammock I sold. GUILTY , aged 17.
