I am a publican , I keep the Marquis of Granby , in St. Margaret's parish ; On the 2d of November, the prisoner had come in to drink in the tap-room, and I was informed the prisoner had got something of nine; I took from him, in the passage, a bed gown, and a pocket; that is all I know about it; I sent for an officer, and he was taken to the Police-office and committed.
I am the wife of the last witness, I can prove the property; the bed-gown was my daughter's, and one pair of pockets, the other was mine.
The prisoner came in, and I saw that he had got these things; and I told my master of it; he went away, he was brought back, and then my master took them out of his bosom.
I am a constable: On the 2d of November the last witness came to me, and told me her master had been robbed; I asked her if she knew his name; she said, no, but I knew the person perfectly well by the description; I met him in the Almonry, Westminster, running; I called to him, but he continued running; I pursued him, and took him back to Mr. Verry's, and he took the property from him.
I was going to the privy to ease myself, I picked up the things between the of age and the privy.
