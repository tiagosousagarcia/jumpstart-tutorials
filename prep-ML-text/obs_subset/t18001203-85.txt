How old are you?
Thirteen last Wednesday; I am servant to Mr. Coventry; I saw the prisoner come in and take the umbrella out of the shop; I stood in a corner, near the street door, I ran out after him, and another man knocked me down; I got up again, and holloaed out, stop thief, and this young man stopped him and brought him back to the door, his name is North.
Are you sure the prisoner is the person?
Yes.
I belong to the 1st regiment of foot guards: On the 15th of November, coming down Oxford-street, I met the prisoner with the umbrella; I heard a live and cry, and I saw this little boy knocked down by another boy; the prisoner had the umbrella under his coat; I pursued him; he then unbuttoned his great coat, and slung the umbrella away towards an area; I pursued him, laid hold of him, and brought him back to Mr. Coventry's shop, and then he was taken to the watch-house; I did not know who picked up the umbrella.
sworn - I live at No. 180, Oxford-road; my little girl picked up this umbrella in the area of my house, and brought it to me, she is not here; she brought it to me about half past five o'clock. (The umbrella produced, and deposed to by the prosecutor.)
I know nothing at all about it.
