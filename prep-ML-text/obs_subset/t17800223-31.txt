The coat and waistcoat are my property; the sheet is the property of Joseph East . They were at the house of Mr. East where I lodged.
This sheet is my property. Mr. Butterfield had lodged at my house, and had left a coat and waistcoat there.
I was going down Little Ayliffe-street, and the string of my patten broke; while I was mending it, I saw the prisoner and two other women go into Mr. East's house, and I saw them all come out again. The prisoner had a sheet hanging below her clothes. I went immediately into Mrs. East and enquired whether they had been selling any thing to these women. She told me she had not; upon which I told her she must then have been robbed. The prisoner was soon after stopped with the things upon her, and I saw all the things in her possession.
I pursued the prisoner, and stopped her; she threw the things upon the paved stones, and said if they were the property of the persons present, they might take them.
I saw the prisoner throw the things out of her apron; she was taken to a publick-house, in order to be put into the custody of a constable, then she said she bought them in the street.
I deal in old clothes, I bought them in the street.
