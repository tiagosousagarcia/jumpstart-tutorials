I keep a public-house in Goodman's Yard, in the Minories . The prisoner was drinking in the house between nine and ten at night: there was no company, only Mr. Irvin in the kitchen. The prisoner went away about ten o'clock: in about three minutes after she was gone, I missed the things mentioned in the indictment (repeating them) she came again the next morning about seven o'clock; she asked for a glass of gin; the servant served her; she said, she had been up all night with a sick person, and would go and lie down on the bed; I was not in the way at the time; a constable was sent for; I did not see her till the constable came, and was charged with her.
On the 17th of March, at night, the prisoner came into Mr. Hughes's house; Mrs. Hughes had been ironing; the different articles she ironed, she laid in a chair in the kitchen; the prisoner sat herself in another chair, near the chair the different articles lay in; I saw her put her right-hand under a cardinal she had on, and her left-hand she out in the chair, and with that she conveyed the things mentioned in the indictment out of the chair; I told Mrs. Hughes of it; the prisoner, hearing me tell her, got up, and went out immediately; the prisoner came the next morning; we sent for a constable, and detained her; she was searched, but there was nothing found upon her; Mr. Hughes was not in the room; she said, she never saw any thing of the kind.
How came you to let her go away the night before?
I did not know that I had a right to stop her without an officer; I told Mrs. Hughes of it.
You was not in the kitchen the night before, when the prisoner went away?
No; I never found my things. My wife is not here; she has been bad five weeks.
I went to the prosecutor's house, they being civil and obliging people; I had been up all night; I asked to lie down; they sent for a constable, and gave charge of me: I know nothing of the affair.
