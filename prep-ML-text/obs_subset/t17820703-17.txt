I was going up to the workshop at Mr. Bean's, on the 25th of May. I stopped the prisoner on the stairs. I insisted on having her searched: upon which she produced two groce of pewter buttons, which she had upon her concealed. I went for Mr. Bean. In the mean while, she produced the rest of the buttons .
A Mrs. Jones asked me to fetch the buttons for her.
