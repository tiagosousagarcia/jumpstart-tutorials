- I am a baker , I live in St. Ann's-lane, the prisoner was a servant of mine: having suspicion that he had frequently taken things out in his pocket and hat, on the 16th of November, on a Sunday, between the hours of nine and ten o'clock, I waited his going; as soon as he got out of the door, I called him back, he refused to come back, and said, he would come presently; I went and brought him back, and I sent for a constable and searched him, and took two pounds and a half of flour out of the lining of his hat, and three threepenny loaves out of his pockets.
Had you a character with him when he came to you?
No, I had not; I was not well, and that was the reason.
I am an officer; I took the things from him, the flour out of his hat, and the three loaves out of his pockets.
The flour was not his, it was in my hat on the Saturday night.
