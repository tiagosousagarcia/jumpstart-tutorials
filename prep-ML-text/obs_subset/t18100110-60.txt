I am shopman to my brother Richard Bradbury , 158, Ratcliffe Highway , he is a haberdasher . On the 20th of December last, I was informed by a girl that a woman had taken something from the door, I immediately ran out overtook the prisoner with the pellise and brought her back to the shop; Brown the officer was coming past, he came in and took her to Shadwell office. I took the pellise, from the prisoner, I have had it ever since.
On the 20th of December, about four o'clock, I saw the woman take the pellise from the side of Mr. Bradbury's shop door.
I throw myself on the mercy of the court.
