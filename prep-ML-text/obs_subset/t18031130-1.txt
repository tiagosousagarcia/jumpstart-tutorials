I am master of Islington Poor-house ; the prisoner came with a load of bricks on the 3d of November, between one and two; one of the nurses of the Infirmary told me she saw him take something off the line in the yard; I run out, and searched him, but could not find any thing on him; I run after the cart, and found the shift under the tail-board of the cart, with his great coat upon it; I sent for a constable, and gave him into custody.
I am one of the nurses: On the 3d of November, between one and two, I saw the prisoner run to a line, and I saw him tucking something under his frock, but I did not see what it was; I then informed my master.
The shift is mine.
I went with the bricks, and my horses startled, and broke the line; I threw the tail-board and great coat into the cart, and run to my horses' heads; they then came out, and said I had stolen a shift; I did not know it was here.
