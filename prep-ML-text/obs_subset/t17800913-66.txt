I am the wife of the prosecutor. On the 6th of August I went out to buy something, when I came back I missed the things mentioned in the indictment, they were taken out of the kitchen.
Between ten and eleven in the morning I saw the prisoner and another woman come to the house; the prisoner went in, the other staid at the door. I saw the prisoner come out with the linen folded up in her apron. They both immediately ran away; when they came into East Smithfield they parted. I followed the prisoner and saw her go into a publick-house, the Three Jolly Sailors. I came back and informed Mary Taylor of this; when we went back to the house she had left it and had left the linen behind her; she was taken an hour after.
I keep the publick-house, the prisoner left these things in my yard.
