On the 10th of June, I met the prisoner upon Saffron-hill; she asked me to give her something to drink, she intreated me very hard, and took me up a passage, and said we could get some down there; I went merely with intent to get something to drink, I thought it was a public-house, till I found myself mistaken; it was between eleven and twelve at night; I put my hand in my pocket, and took out a guinea and a shilling, and she snatched it out of my hand and knocked down the candle; I asked her what she did that for, she said, what was that to me; and there was a man in a smock-frock, the whispered to him to get away from me.
Did you ever see her before?
No.
You fly you went merely to give her something to drink; will you swear that?
Yes.
I am a watchman: I heard the watch called, and I went upon the call, and met a man in a smock-frock, he told me I was not wanted; the prosecutor called again, I went, and he gave me charge of the prisoner; they had no light, and she said, she had no money but sixpence; I took her to the watch-house, and searched her, but found nothing upon her but a sixpence.
