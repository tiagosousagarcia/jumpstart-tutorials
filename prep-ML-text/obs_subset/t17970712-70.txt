I am an organ-builder , in St. Martin's Church-yard, Westminster: On Friday, the 30th of June, I was walking through Fleet-street , near Temble-bar, in company with Mr. Ribbons, and about a foot or two before I got to Temple-bar, I felt a man's hand in my pocket; I instantly turned round and caught hold of it, my handkerchief was in his hand, and about three, parts hanging out of my pocket; I turned round, and said to Mr. Ribbons, here is a rascal has got his hand in my pocket, and I secured him; this is the handkerchief.
I was walking in company with Mr. Avery on Friday fe'nnight, in the evening, when he turned round, and said, here is a d-d rascal picking my pocket; I turned round, and he had got hold of the prisoner; upon that, we took him to the watch-house.
I enquired into his character, and found it so much against him that I determined to pursue the prosecution.
I have had a bad character, but I work very hard for my living now.
