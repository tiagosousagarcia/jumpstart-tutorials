I am a publican ; I keep the Blue Last, Blackfriars : On the 2d of September, between eleven and twelve o'clock at night, the prisoner came into the tap-room, and had nothing to drink; I missed a pint pot the moment she was gone; it was upon the table in the taproom; I went after her, and caught her with the pot in her apron upon Ludgate-hill.
I am a constable: I took charge of the prisoner at the watch-house.
I was very much in liquor, and did not know what I did.
