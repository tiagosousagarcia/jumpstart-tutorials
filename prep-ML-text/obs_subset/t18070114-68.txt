I am a baker , I live in Bethnall green; the prisoner was servant to me.
You entrusted him to receive money for you.
Yes, of my customers on my account; he came into my service on the first of November last; from information I received from a customer, I suspected him, after he had been with me three weeks; I then made out the bills of customers accompts who had been in the habit of paying for bread, on delivery; there is two witnesses in court, that I sent bills to and neither of them owed me a farthing.
I live in Wilmot street, Bethnal green.
You deal with Mr. Smart the baker.
Yes, I am in the habit of paying for my bread on delivery, except the prisoner could not give change, then I paid the next day. On the 12th of December, Mr. Smart sent a bill of fourteen shillings and three pence farthing, which I was very much surprised at, knowing that I did not owe for a single loaf; I am sure that I paid him for every loaf of bread that he delivered.
The person where the bill of indictment was made, said it must be some specific day only, I selected the 24th of November.
Did you pay for the 24th of November.
I did, if I did not pay him on that day, I paid him on the next.
On the 24th of November, did you receive that money.
I did not, here is the book he made return that day, half peck loaf to Mrs. Lucedon.
That is my writing, I booked it from the man's own mouth that day, two shillings and two pence halfpenny.
I am innocent of the charge alledged against me.
