I live No. 77, Wardour-street, St. James's . I am a cordwainer . On the 15th of January I lost a pair of boots out of my shop, on the Saturday evening; they were sent back to me about six to have a new strap put on; I put them on my cutting board for that purpose, and went into the yard to wash my hands; my wife called to me that somebody had opened the door, and shut it; I went to see who was there, and found the boots gone from the cutting board, where I had put them not two minutes before; I went out and saw nobody; I came back and gave information at Bow-street; my wife could see in the shop so as to see the door open or shut, though a person might by stooping come in without being seen.
I am one of the conductors of the patrols belonging to Sir Sampson Wright ; and on the 17th I saw the prisoner coming along with something under his coat; I challenged him, and asked him what he had? and he said, a piece of cheese, which he had bought; then I took him to the Brown Bear, in Bow-street; there I searched him; I found a piece of cheese, some buckles, and a bottle of gin, and three small knives; he said, there were four knives; and I took the candle to look for it, and I saw these boots on his legs; I made him take them off; there was the maker's name on them; I went to the prosecutor's, and he said they were his: the prisoner told me his father was coachman to a gentleman, and these boots were not big enough for his young master, and he gave them to him, and he gave them to the prisoner.
On Saturday night I was all night, and all day on Sunday, on board ship, at Tower Wharf, and on Monday morning I bought the boots of a Jew, in Rag Fair; I gave him twelve shillings for them; and on Monday night he took me; and I thought he was going to trepan me; I told him the things were for my sister, in the country; I told him I got the boots honestly; the Jew asked me fourteen shillings, and I bid him twelve shillings; I have lived with respectable families; I was ashamed to send for my friends; I am eighteen years of age.
