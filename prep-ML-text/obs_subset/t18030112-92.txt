I missed a quantity of shoes about eight or nine o'clock, in the evening of December the 11th, from the window, which I had seen not long before, but know nothing of the robbery.
I am an officer belonging to Worship-street: On the 11th of December, about eight o'clock in the evening, I and Armstrong saw the prisoner, with some other boys, turning round a corner; the prisoner said to the others, this way, this way, this is the nearest way; and they turned up a court; upon that, I caught hold of him by the coat, and the other two run away. I searched the prisoner, who set himself against the wall, and put his hand behind him, and dropped this pair of shoes, (produces them) which I picked up. Armstrong then returned, after pursuing the others, but could not overtake them; he picked up a quantity of shoes in a handkerchief, which he brought back, and then the prisoner said, the pair he dropped did not belong to him.
I had been on an errand, and saw several men pass me, who I did not know; then Vickery stopped me, and searched me, but found nothing; he then said there was a pair of shoes at my feet, but I know nothing of them.
A square of glass was cracked, and the piece taken out, through which they reached the shoes.
