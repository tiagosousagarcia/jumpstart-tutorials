I lost two linen gowns from the yard, hanging up to dry; I did not see them taken, but I was sent for on the 16th of this month to Sir Sampson Wright's.
I go out to wash and iron; I was hanging out some clothes out of a two pair of stairs window, and saw a man take a wet gown, and put it under his coat, and I gave an alarm.
I follow the sea, I heard the alarm given, and I ran after the prisoner, and took him in Great Earl-street with the bundle under his arm. (Produced and deposed to.) I live in the house from whence they were taken.
How far is that from whence you took the prisoner?
It is the length of a short street and court.
I am a taylor by trade; I went into a house in that street to do my business, and as I was coming out again, two young men met me, and desired me to take hold of the things, and asked me if I had an handkerchief in my pocket, and he called me by my christian name, and desired me to hold them things for him, and I did, and this young man came up, and took me upon the alarm, and the other fellow ran off.
