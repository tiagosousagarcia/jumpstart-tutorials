I live at No. 52, Marshall-street, Carnaby Market, I am a butcher .
Who is your partner.
James Somers ; there was a piece of lead missing from the slaughterhouse, which the prisoner was detected of having.
Who detected the prisoner.
The watchman on the night of the 20th of April; I saw it put to the place, it fitted exactly.
How long before had you seen it there.
I cannot say.
It was affixed to the slaughtering house.
It was put under another piece of lead; it was so affixed as not to be moved without some force.
I repaired the slaughterhouse last August, there was a long gutter, the end was cut of, we were obliged to put a piece of lead about two foot long, to convey the water to the gutter, we put it under and beat it down.
Then it would not have come away without any body had moved it.
No, I fitted the lead to the place, it fitted exactly; I believe it is the same piece of lead that I put on.
I was ordered to go with the lead to see it fitted on, the last witness and the prosecutor fitted it on, it appeared to fit the place.
On Sunday, the 20th of April, as I was crying the hour of twelve o'clock, I saw the prisoner sitting down, I asked him what he was about, he said he was easing himself; I put up my lanthorn, and missed the spout, and I saw a lamp lighter's ladder up against the slaughter house, I desired him to get up, I saw the spout under him, he had no shoes on; there was no other person near, I took him to the watchhouse without his shoes, I returned for the ladder, and found the shoes under the steps of the ladder.
(to prosecutor) You have no doubt of that lead being yours.
I have not the least doubt in the world.
I was along with a few relations, it was late before I came home, I went up stairs and pulled my shoes off; I was taken so bad with a pain in my bowels, I came down to ease myself, I saw a man run away; before I could get my breeches unbuttoned the watchman came and took me to the watchhouse.
