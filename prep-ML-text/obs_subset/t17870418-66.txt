I am butler to Sir John Skynner ; the prisoner was laundry maid about a year and a half; the pawnbroker informed us before we missed the linen; the prisoner did not deny it.
She said she lived with Judge Heath; I sent there and they knew nothing of her; then I was a going to send for a constable, and she fell a crying, and said she lived at Baron Skinner 's, and they were his property.
I beg for mercy; I have nobody to my character; I leave myself entirely to Sir John's mercy and the gentlemen of the Jury.
She behaved vastly well always; bore a very good character for years before, a quiet sober girl.
I intended to redeem them again.
You could not be distressed for money in that service I am sure.
It was for the lottery.
