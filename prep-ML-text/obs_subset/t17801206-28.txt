I am shopman to Nicholas Simmonds , who keeps a pawnbroker's and sale shop; we hang goods for show on the outside of the door; this coat was hanging upon the outside of the door; the door opens inwardly; I saw the door shake; I looked through the glass and saw something missing. I went out; a person told me a man was gone up the alley adjoining to the shop; I went up the alley and overtook the prisoner; he had this coat under his arm; it has the shop mark upon it.
I saw the coat lying on the stones; I took it up and went up the passage; as soon as he called me I delivered it to him.
