I am a publican ; I keep the Ship, Little Turnstile, Holborn ; I did not see the pots taken.
I am a glazier: the prisoner at the bar came into Mr. Wells's, and called for a pint of beer, drank off the beer, and went backwards, and staid a long time; and I looked (knowing he was a stranger to the house), and saw him open the kitchen-door, and take out a quart pot, and carry it into the yard, and put it behind the door; and then he came and took a second, and put it in the same place; and hearing a disturbance in the house, he steps into the house, and whips down in the place where he was before, and appeared very much frighted; and I went to the landlady, and told her; and another man went to the prisoner, and said, you rogue, you have been robbing the landlady, stealing quart pots; he trembled very much, and said he never did such a thing in his life: they asked him what he was; he said he was a porter for his livelihood: we went backward, and found the pots behind the door; I took them from the door, and gave them to the landlady; I believe the landlord was present.
I received them from my wife; the prisoner was not present; he was in the tap-room at the time; I lost a gallon-pot the same evening before.
I am a coach-harness-plate-maker, I was in this public-house; I saw the prisoner go backward, and he was a great while backward; he came into the door, and slipt into the box; and this young fellow, John Earing , was in the tap-room, and he saw the prisoner had been carrying the pots out one at a time; we kept the prisoner while he went out for the pots; I saw them brought in.
What name was on those pots?
Michael Wells .
I am the patrol; I took him into custody; there was nothing found upon him.
I took him into custody.
