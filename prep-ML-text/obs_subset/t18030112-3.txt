I am a conveyancer ; this day week, about one o'clock, I was coming down Fleet-street , towards Fleet-market; near Water-lane, a person informed me I had lost my handkerchief; I immediately turned round, and laid hold of the prisoner; I found my handkerchief inside his coat, under his arm; a constable immediately came up, and I gave charge of him; the handkerchief cost me 7s. it is a silk one; the prisoner said, as I dropped it out of my pocket, he picked it up.
I am clerk to Messrs. Richardson, stock-brokers; this day week I saw the prisoner take a handkerchief from Mr. Emden's pocket.(John Cordery, a constable, produced the handkerchief, which was identified by the prosecutor.)
I picked up the handkerchief in the street; I did not see the gentleman drop it.
