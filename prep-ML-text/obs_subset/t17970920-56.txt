- On the 31st of July, I missed some flour; I had no reason to suspect the prisoner; he always behaved like an honest servant to me; I left him at four o'clock that morning in care of my property; I did not miss it till the watchman brought the prisoner back.
You always found him very honest?
Yes.
I am a watchman; after calling four o'clock, the prisoner came up to me with some flour upon his shoulder in a sack; says I, do you belong to a baker, or are you a baker yourself? yes, I am, says he, a baker; are you a journeyman, or an apprentice, says I? says he, a journeyman; he said, he was going to High-street, Mary-le-bonne; says I, I will go with you to your employer, and see whether you are right or wrong; watchman, says he, you need not say any thing about it, and we will have something to drink; I called to my partner, and we took him as far as the corner of the watch-house, and then he threw away the bag, and ran off; we called, stop thief, and he was stopped by another watchman; when we got him to the watch-house, Mr. Toombs came up and gave charge of him.
He did not run away till he was frightened by the sight of the watch-house?
No.
- I am watchhouse keeper; the bag was delivered to me, and has been in my custody ever since.
I cannot say positively this is my sack; it is like it.
Your mealman has a great many sacks of the same sort?
Yes.
Then you cannot swear that that is your's?
No, I cannot.
