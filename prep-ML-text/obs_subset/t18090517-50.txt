My husband's name is William Craxford; the prisoner came to my house on the 14th of April.
Was she an acquaintance of yours
I know nothing of her; she came in unperceived by me or any of my children; a neighbour knocked at my door, and from the information I received, I found her on the landing place; she had just come out of the front kitchen with some coats; I saw her laying them out of her hands as I came on the passage.
What coats were in her hand
Two of my husband's coats, and a pair of my husband's boots; she saw me come, and then she laid them out of her hand.
Where had the coats been
They lay on our bed; I left them there not ten minutes; I asked her what she wanted down there, she said let me go backwards; I looked and saw that my husband's coats and boots were laying down by her; I asked her if she was going to take them away, she told me that she had not got any thing; she wished to get away very much. I sent for an officer, he apprehended her.
Have you found out since who she is
I have heard a bad character of her.
On the same morning the prisoner came into my house unobserved by me; my mother saw her, she asked her what she wanted; she said she wanted to go backwards, my mother went backwards with her; I had a suspicion of the woman, I went out and watched her. I saw her go into Mrs. Craxford's house.
I never had the property at all. I am innocent of the charge.
