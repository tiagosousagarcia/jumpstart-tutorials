I am a soldier ; I lost my watch; the prisoner took it from me, I met her at Westminster between twelve and one at night on the 4th of June; I agreed with her to go home to her lodging, and we went into an ale-house which was within two or three doors of her lodging, and had a pint of ale; and she went to get a light to her room, and while she was gone I counted my money, four shillings and some halfpence, and when she came down I paid for a pint of beer, and the landlord asked me what it was o'clock, and I looked at my watch, and it was one.
What public house was this?
It was in Duck-lane; I believe the landlord's name is Coleman; then we went up stairs, and I stripped off my clothes, and put the chain of my watch round the button of my waist-coat; the door was locked; and we went to sleep; and I waked at four; and the door was open; and she was gone, and my watch and money; I had been drinking a little that day, but I was perfectly sober; I went and got a warrant on Monday, and took her up; she would not own to it; on Monday she sent for me, and another lad went with me, and she confessed.
Did you promise her any favour if she
confessed, in order to induce her to confess?
Yes, I said, if she would tell; I desired her to tell.
Did not you tell her it would be better for her?
Yes, I did.
I am a niece to a pawnbroker; I never saw the prisoner; I took this watch from one Simon Connel ; he is not here.
I never touched the watch at all, nor I never owned it; my witnesses were here all day yesterday.
