- I am an agent, and ship-broker , I live at No. 66, Duke-street, Manchester-square : On and before the 14th of December, I lost a great quantity of things to a large amount; I have recovered the articles mentioned in the indictment, (repeating them) I had not worn them for a long time, having a larger quantity than were immediatly necessary. In consequence of suspicion, I had the prisoner apprehended; she was a chairwoman in the house.
I am the wife of Thomas Layton: I lost a great number of articles in the wash; I could not suspect any body but the prisoner or the servant, I missed them for three or four months; I told the prisoner I had missed a great many things, and she said it was a sad thing to have a thief in the house; I said there was nobody in the house but herself and the servant; we got an officer from Marlborough-street, and they were both searched, there was nothing found upon them; I was not present at the search at the prisoner's lodgings.
On the 14th of December, I was sent for to Mr. Layton's house; I searched the servant's box, but did not find any thing there; I then went to the lodgings of the prisoner, she was not at home, but was sent for; she came, and in her box I found a small wooden box, containing a number of duplicates of Mrs. Layton's property; I have the tickets; the pawnbrokers are here with the goods.
