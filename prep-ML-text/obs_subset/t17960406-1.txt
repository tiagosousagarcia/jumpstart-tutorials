My father is a silk dyer and scowerer , No. 33, Wych-street : On the 24th of February my mother called to me, and told me, a boy was gone out of the shop; I followed him to the corner of Arrundel-street, and said, he had got something that did not belong to him; he said, he had not; I looked in his apron, and found three pair of breeches; two pair of stcoking breeches, and one pair of buff thickset; I never lost fight of him;(the things produced in Court), these are my father's property; I had seen them in the shop not ten minutes before the prisoner took them; they have our shop marks in the waistband.
I took these things out of the prisoner's apron.
I was going along and saw these three pair of breeches lying upon the area rails; I enquired of a boy that I saw there, who they belonged to; he said, he did not know; and I put them in my apron, and this man came up.
