I am a fishing-rod maker by trade, I lodge at Mr. Payne's, in Bell Yard , on the first of April, I missed the things mentioned in the indictment out of the room where I work, which is the back room, I live in the front room, three pair of stairs; they were my wife's cloaths, she tied them up and brought them in for washing in a bundle; I went into the next room to light a bit of charcoal, and a lodger opposite met the prisoner in the passage with the bundle going down stairs; then they called to me, and I saw the woman on the landing-place, and the bundle was on the ground; I do not know the prisoner.
I lodge in the opposite room, I saw the prisoner standing in the middle of the landing place, I said, who do you want here; and she offered to go down stairs, and I saw her have a bundle under her cloak, says I what have you got there, and directly she dropped it; so, I called to the prosecutor, and I pursued and took her.
I hope you will have compassion upon me, I have five small children.
Then you should have worked for them, not stole for them: what way of life are you in?
I was going down to the parish to Bath, my husband is dead, he was a marine; I know nothing of the things, they took me in the street.
