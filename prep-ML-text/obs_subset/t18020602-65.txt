I am a Jewess , and a single woman ; I live at No. 11, Bury-street, St. Mary-Axe , with my mother; the prisoner lived with us as servant : On Saturday the 22d of May, I missed my gown, and told the prisoner the must have taken it, and had better confess; she said it was out of the house; I went with her to a house in Gravel-lane, Houndsditch, where no person was at home; I told the prisoner we would go again, and at the corner of Earl-street she ran away, but I called her, and she came back.
Are there any other persons living in the house than your family?
My mother has boarders; but she had no more than one man lodger, and two men boarders, at that time; and the gown was in the room where the prisoner and I slept.
The house where the prisoner took you to, was where the washerwoman lived?
So I understood.
Was it clean, or dirty?
I had worn it twice, it had never been washed.
She came back when you called her?
Yes.
Perhaps you had lent it her?
No; I never gave her leave to wear any of my things.
I live in Gravel-lane, Houndsditch; I am a chair-woman and a washerwoman: The first time I saw the prisoner, was last Tuesday was a fortnight, she came up with my lodger; and on the Thursday following, she came and asked me if I would wash her a round dress; I said, yes, and asked her if she was in place; she said, no, but was in expectation of one; she said she did not want the gown till the next Monday was a week, and left it; last Saturday, Mr. Gabitis brought the prisoner, and took the gown away.
She did not offer to sell it, only brought it to be washed?
No; and I should have washed it.
A. I took the prisoner into custody, and fetched the gown from the last witness.
How many times had you promised you would not appear against her if she told you where it was?
I told her, before I sent for Gabitis, I would not do any thing to her if she told me where it was.
I leave my defence to my Counsel.
