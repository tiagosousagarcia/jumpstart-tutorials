I keep a house at South Mims : On the 26th of May last, I left it between eight and nine in the morning, to go to my work; I was fetched home by James Lawrence, who told me my house was robbed; I went back, and found a pane of glass broke out of the window where the thief got in, and the door open; I had left every thing safe and fast; when I returned, the bar was taken down from the backdoor, and I missed all the articles in the indictment (repeating them) , and a great many more, which were there when I went out.
I went to Brown as soon as the robbery was discovered at four o'clock; the back-door was left open, and the window hung upon a hook; the boxes were broke all to pieces; we looked among the hedges, and perceived a hair-broom stuck in a gap of the hedge; we looked further, and, nearly through the hedge, we found a large bundle of linen, gowns, shifts, and handker chiefs; James Lawrence and I watched from between nine and ten at night, till three in the morning, when I saw the prisoner at the bar come up to the gap, where he had put the broom for a token; then he threw the remainder of a sack off his shoulders, pulled out the hair-broom, and threw it across; and, after looking about him, he came to look for the bundle, and run his head into the hole in the hedge; I was not above three yards from him, and immediately I took him, and brought him to Brown's house, and sent for a constable; it was about three o'clock, and was day-light, so that I could see very well; Brown has had the things ever since, by order of the Justice, as he had lost all his clothes.
Did you take the sack and the bundle?
I did; and, by the Justice's order, I took out some of the clothes that were for necessary wear.
Can you take upon you to say that those things are your's, and your wife's?
Yes.
The things that you took out were your's?
Yes.
And they were in your trunk the Sunday before?
Yes.
Was the sack taken out of your house?
Yes, it was in the house in the morning when I went out.
Is the coat your's?
Yes.
And the waistcoat?
Yes.
And the boy's waistcoat?
Yes.
You were alarmed about this robbery?
Yes.
About what time?
About four in the evening.
You assisted Brown to find out who it was?
Yes.
You went to the place where you saw this broom?
Yes.
And you watched till between two and three o'clock the next morning?
Yes.
Did you then see the prisoner at the bar?
Yes; he came to the place where the broom was, and laid the sack down; he came over the hedge, and pulled the broom out, and then he went to the place where the bundle was.
I got up in the morning to go to work, and I happened to go over this gap where the things were hid, but I did not know any thing about the robbery; I thought it was a wire put down for a hare; and then these men came up to me and used me very ill.
