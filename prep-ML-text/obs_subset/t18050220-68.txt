This is the same goose that the last prisoner took; on Saturday, the 26th of January, when we returned from the Mansion-house (where we had been with the last prisoner) , about six o'clock, the goose being an article that would not keep, the officer brought it back; I did not lay the goose out directly, I put it out on the board; I was shewing a couple of fowls to a lady; I heard some paper rattle behind me where the goose was laid on; I turned round and saw the prisoner at the bar with her cloak on, which she partly threw over the goose, and with her left hand she drew the goose over the board; I saw the best part of the goose move from the board, she did not go away from the shop; I asked her what she had got there, she said, she had got nothing; I put my hand to her side and there I felt the goose; I took it from her, and gave her in charge.
Did you know any thing of this woman before?
I have seen her before.
I was going through the market, to provide for me and my family, and there was a cry about this goose; I saw several people stand to see what was the matter; I was standing there because I could not get through; this young man came to me, and said that I was the person that took the goose.
