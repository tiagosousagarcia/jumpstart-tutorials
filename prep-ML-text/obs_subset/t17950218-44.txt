You are the wife of John Thomas Rigg ?
Yes.
See if you know the prisoner?
Yes, I see him on the 15th of January , I believe it was Thursday, about one o'clock; my husband is a perfumer; I had agreed to buy sixpenny worth of oranges of this person in the street, in Fleet-street; I gave him a shilling, and, as I supposed, he returned it me, saying it was a bad one; I gave him another, he rubbed that and returned it, wishing I had got another he should like it better; I immediately put my hand in my pocket and took out one and gave it him.
Did you take that one back from him?
Yes. I gave him a third, and he returned that; I gave him five in all, and he returned them; he objected to the fifth, he would have changed the fifth, only I told him I had not another in my pocket.
Then, if I understand you right, you took four back in all, you did not take the fifth back?
No. At that moment that he was going to give me the sixpence, he had five of my shillings, and I had got four of his in my hand, and he was going to give me sixpence, at that time a person named March came out of his own shop, and asked me if I was sure the prisoner gave me good money, and wished me to give it him, which I did out of my hand; he told me there were one or two very bad ones; he took and collared the man, and took him into the shop, and I followed him, and these five shillings that I gave to the man, my husband gave me about five minutes before I left home, and they were all the silver I had in my pocket.
Do you know whether your money was good?
I don't know a bad shilling from a good one.
You said something about a sixpence, do you know whether Mr. March took that sixpence from him?
I cannot say, I believe Mr. March has got it.
In what way did he sell oranges in the street?
In a basket. I was asked by him if I wished to buy any? I said, no, except he would let me have a dozen for sixpence; which he agreed to.
What is your husband's name?
John Thomas Rigg.
You stated first now, that you hardly knew a bad shilling from a good one?
I am an utter stranger in London.
You may have had the misfortune with other people, to have bad silver in your pocket?
I may have had, but at that time I did not know that they were bad.
You seemed to have made a very good bargan?
It was very cold, and he followed me some way.
You gave some money to your wife before she went out?
Yes; to the best of my knowledge they were good; I looked at them rather minutely, because I know Mrs. Rigg don't know a good shilling from a bad one; it was the 15th of January.
How long have you had the good fortune to be in London?
All my life time.
I take it for granted you are well aware there are a great many bad shillings in circulation?
No doubt of it.
Do you mean to bind yourself down on your oath that the five shillings you gave to your wife were all good?
I believe to the best of my knowledge they were; I think it would not be prudent to be positive.
I am a fishing tackle-maker, in Fleet-street. On the 15th of January last, between one and two o'clock, I was sitting in my back parlour at dinner, and I observed this lady bargaining for some oranges with that man, and when she had bargained with him for the oranges, she gave him a piece of money, which I believe was a shilling; he took it into his hand, and then put it to his mouth and gave it a bite, and then returned, as I thought it was the same; she held out her hand to him and gave him another; he then tried that on the sleeve of his coat, and returned that; she then gave him a third and then a fourth; it then struck me he was playing some trick or other, and I went to the door and asked the lady if she was positive the shillings he returned into her hand were the shillings that she gave him? she said she did not know; and I immediately took the shillings out of her hand, and dragged him into the house, and the lady came in after him; I searched him in order to see if he had any more about him, and I found one bad sixpence, and three or four good shillings he dropped out of his mouth, and six and sixpence good about him, and these four I took out of the lady's hand were all bad.
So that six and sixpence, and the three shillings you describe to have been in his mouth, were all good, only one bad sixpence out of the number.
Look at the good shillings and see if you made any observations on them you gave to your wife?
I cannot say to one of them; I presume them I gave to my wife were all good.
Those four that you call bad ones, do you know they are all bad ones?
I am sure two are very bad.
Look at the four shillings?
Three of them appear very bad.
What do you say to the sixpence?
It appears to be a bad one.
