- I live in Clare-court, Clare-market ; the prisoner at the bar has been a lodger of mine about a twelve-month; I let her a room at 2s. a week, without furniture, and then she came back and gave me 3s. a week far a room with furniture; I lost the things in the indictment, (repeating them) , on the 23d of July last I missed them all; I had taken an inventory of them when I let her the room; I had some suspicion that they were going, and I went up several times to demand admission, but I never could gain admittance till the 23d of July; she was going into the room in the evening, and I went in with her; I missed the things, and called the watchman; she was taken to the watch-house, where she remained till the Monday morning; she had paid me three quarters out of four; I found the sheet at Mr. Jones's, pawnbroker, in Long-acre, which I took out of pawn myself, and a brass candlestick and part of the top valance of the bed, the corner of Broad-court, Long-acre, which I took out of pawn myself.
Do you know in what way she gets her living?
Her husband allows her something to live upon, and she works at her needle, but loses all her customers as soon as she gets them, by pawning the things.
I never cheated him nor any body else; I pawned the things with intention to return them again; I had not left the room, nor did not intend it.
