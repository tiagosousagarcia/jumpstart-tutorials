The prisoner and two more came into my shop the 6th of November; my shop is near the Minories, at a place called Sparrow Corner ; they came into the shop to buy a couple of jackets, I fitted one with a jacket, and I was endeavouring to fit the other, and just as I was fitting one of the others with the jacket there was a man and woman at the same time endeavouring to deal for some black clothes, came down stairs, and my servant that was up in the wareroom, could not deal with them; I told him to tell them to walk into the parlour, and I would endeavour to deal with them; so I told the man to go into the shop to serve them young men with some jackets; so I sold the man and woman some black clothes, and came to the door, my servant served these people one jacket, and they went away; I had fitted them with one jacket, but had not sold them it; a neighbour of mine came and informed me that he thought one of them young men that had gone out had got something under his jacket, and that he had gone on Tower-hill; and this young man and I ran after them; this young man overtook them, and took this jacket from under his jacket; I see him take it from him.
I produce the jacket; I was along with the last witness, on the pursuit of the prisoner, I took him and he had this jacket with him at the time.
It has my mark upon it.
I want to ask the prosecutor whether I stole the jacket, or whether I had the jacket given me by one of the young fellows?
It was not given by me.
How did you come by that jacket?
I and two more came on shore, and wanted to buy us some jackets, and we went into two or three shops, and we could not get a jacket to suit, and then we went into this man's house, and we tried on two or three jackets, and this young man that bought this jacket gave this jacket to me and told me to go on with it, and he would over, take me; with that I went on to Tower-hill, to make haste to my ship.
