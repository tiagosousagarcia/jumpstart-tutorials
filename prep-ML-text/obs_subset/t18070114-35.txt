I live in Dartmouth street, Westminster , I am a linen draper . On Tuesday the 30th of December, about one o'clock in the forenoon, I missed from the side of my door, they were partly in and partly out, a quantity of remnants of printed cotton, I had seen them at eleven o'clock myself, and at a little after one I missed them. I immediately gave information to the police office, Queen's square.
I am an officer. On the 9th of December I was applied to by a man giving me information that the prisoner at the bar was at Mr. Morrat's in York street, I went there; the prisoner was there in the act of pawning these three pieces. I asked the prisoner if she had brought these three pieces; they were then lying on the counter. She said she had brought them to pawn.
You was along with the other witness at the time that the prisoner was apprehended.
Yes, I took these twenty two pieces of cotton from under her arm; the prisoner told me they were her own property.
On the 9th of December, about eleven o'clock, the prisoner pledged two pieces of cotton for three shillings.
I am a pawnbroker. On the 9th of December, between the hours of one and two in the afternoon, the prisoner brought three pieces of cotton to our shop. I lent three shillings upon them.
I was going along by the door, and a young woman overtook me, and asked me if I would take them for her.
