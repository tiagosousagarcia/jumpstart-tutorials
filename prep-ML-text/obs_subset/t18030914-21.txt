- I am a baker at Bow; the prisoner was my servant; I sent him out with a barrow of bread on the 22d of August, value 30s. he never returned, or brought any money; the barrow, with two loaves, was brought back by a stranger.
- I live at Old Ford , and deal with Mr. Dean: On Monday, the 22d of August, I received a half quartern loaf from the prisoner, and paid him five shillings and threepence farthing, which I owed for bread; he had been with bread before, and I paid it on account of Mr. Dean.
I have nothing to say.
