I am a gun-stocker by trade. On Saturday the 9th of September I went out to tea. I placed a tenant saw upon a bench in my master's shop. I was absent an hour and an half; when I was returning to the shop John Pinkerton met me; he said he had seen the saw taken away. I saw it the same day in the possession of Crocker. It is my property.
Coming out of my master's shop, I observed the saw in the prisoner's hand; he laid it down upon seeing me; after that he went away with his coat buttoned, and his arm under his coat. I could not see the saw, but I suspected he had stolen it; after he was gone I went into the shop, and missed it.
On the 9th of September, about four in the afternoon , the prisoner brought this saw to me. I lent him two shillings upon it; he said it was his own property.
I know nothing at all of it.
