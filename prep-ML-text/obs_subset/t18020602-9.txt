I keep the Dolphin upon Ludgate-hill : About two o'clock yesterday; the prisoner came in, and went into the parlour; he came out again, and had a glass of gin at the bar; about a minute after he was gone, a quart pot was missing from the parlour; my wife went after him, and took him, with the pot upon him.
I am a porter: I heard an alarm; I came up, and the prisoner and the pot were delivered to me.
I went after the prisoner, and took him in Trinity-lane, with the pot in his pocket; I took hold of him, and he said, don't make a noise, and I will settle it, or make it up; I don't know which; a young man then came up, and he was brought back.
I have known the man a great many years; I did not take it with an intention of wronging him; I had been drinking very hard, and did not know that I had it.
