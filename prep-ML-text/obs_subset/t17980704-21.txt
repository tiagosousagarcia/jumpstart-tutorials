I am servant to Mr. Thomas Newman, waggoner : On Saturday the 2d of June, between three and four in the afternoon, I took the prisoner in the waggon, with the loaf of sugar in his hand, he was very abusive, it was in a brown paper parcel. (Produces it.)
Is there any writing upon it?
Yes, but I cannot read.
Did you see any vacancy for it?
Yes.
Had he lifted the sugar out of the place that it was in?
Yes; he had it in his arms, and I made him lay it down; I delivered the sugar to Mr. Atkins; I am sure this is the same parcel.
I keep the Vine inn; I had not left the waggon two minutes, when I heard somebody say, the waggon is robbed, I turned round directly, and saw the prisoner in the waggon.
What is the value of the sugar?
About thirty shillings, it is worth one shilling a pound; the prisoner used very abusive language indeed.
I now belong to the Sea-horse frigate; I got leave to come a-shore to seek after my prize money that was due to me from the Scorpion sloop of war; I am entirely innocent of it, I was never in the waggon at all.
