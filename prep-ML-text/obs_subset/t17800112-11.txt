I lost a keg of gin, worth 1 s. 6 d.
I am servant to Mr. Booth; I met the prisoner near the door with a keg of gin upon his shoulder, he wished me a good night; I suspected something; I went in and asked if any body had been served with such a quantity of gin; I found there had not; upon this we pursued the prisoner, and within twenty yards of the shop took him with the keg upon his shoulder.
I have no witnesses here; I had been at Turnmill-street to get some beer and some victuals; coming down Turnmill-street I passed that gentleman's shop; they came out and ran after me and said I had stolen some liquor out of their house, and they took me to the distill house again, and then took me before the justice; I never had the keg.
