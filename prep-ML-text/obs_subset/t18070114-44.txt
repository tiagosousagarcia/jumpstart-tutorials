I am shopman to Abraham Holford , he is a linen draper , No. 6, Bishopsgate street . On the 6th of December, about six o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came into the shop making motions that he wished to see something for handkerchiefs; I left the prisoner and went to look for the articles, and when I returned I perceived him putting something in his pocket. I afterwards saw his jacket pocket projected out very much, and from the manner of his keeping his arm down, I suspected that he had stole something. I called Mr. Holford from the other side of the shop, he immediately went up to him, and took the chambry out of his pocket. The prisoner at first said it was his; upon Mr. Holford shewing him the mark, the prisoner endeavoured to get away.
The muslin was not in my pocket.
Are you sure that this chambry was in his pocket.
Yes.
Are you shopman to Mr. Holford.
Yes; the prisoner at the bar came to Mr. Holford's shop, he signified by pointing to his neckcloth, that he wanted some muslin for handkerchiefs. John Field waited upon him, to shew him the articles. In a few minutes he informed Mr. Holford, that he had reason to suppose that the prisoner had stolen something; Mr. Holford went up to the prisoner, and took it out of his pocket; I saw it hang partly out of his pocket. The prisoner denied having stolen it, he said he had bought it; he was then taken in custody, and taken to the counter.
When Castello first came in the shop, he asked for some muslin.
He did, he asked for white muslin, this was a check.
Was it not a natural colour for a foreign sailor to use.
Provided it was in handkerchiefs.
Here is several of them, they all tell one story of my having this in my pocket; I deny it. I have no one for me but God; I said how much, they said four shillings, me give two shillings; and after me put down two shillings, they would not take it, they bring me a prisoner.
