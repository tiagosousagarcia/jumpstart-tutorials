I live in town, and my sister live at Kentish-town ; the sheets are our joint property; their names are Rose, Eleanor, and Lucy; the house is let out in lodgings; the prisoner was our servant ; I challenged her with having taken the sheets on the Thursday night, she was very much in liquor, and she denied it; but in the morning, when she was sober, she told me she had pawned a sheet at Mr. Davis's, in Monmouth-street; I went there, and instead of finding one, I found two.
On the 14th of April the prisoner brought a sheet and pledged for half a crown; and in the afternoon of the same day another sheet for half a crown.
These are our sheets. I have known the prisoner for years; I never heard any thing against her before.
I meant to take them out again.
