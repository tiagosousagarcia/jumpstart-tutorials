I am a sawyer , and work with Thomas Burton . We went out of the yard where we were working in Bow-street, Covent-garden , on the 23d of last month, about three o'clock, to get a pint of beer; we returned in about four minutes, then we found the gate open. Just as I came up to the door the prisoner came out; I asked her what she wanted, or whether she knew any body there; I pulled down her apron and out tumbled Burton's jacket and waistcoat, my great coat and waistcoat she let fall out of her apron. She went down on her knees and asked me to forgive her.
I was present when the things were found upon the prisoner.
My three children had the small pox, one has been cut for the stone, and this has lost its sight since it has been in prison. I owed fourteen shillings for rent; I was going to my master's to borrow a few shillings to save my goods, this man met me in the street and knocked me down two or three times; he said he believed I was the person who stole his coat. I know nothing of the coat.
