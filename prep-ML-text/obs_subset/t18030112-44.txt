- I am clerk to Mr. Matthew Craven , No. 4, Leman-street, Goodman's-fields : On the 28th of December, being in the warehouse about one o'clock, I saw the prisoner coming down stairs; I asked him where he had been, he said he had been up stairs for a clay ladle: he was apprentice to a coppersmith , who does our business; I told him he had no business in the warehouse, if he wanted any thing he was to ask for it in the warehouse; I went up to him, and asked him what he had got upon him; he took out a small piece of sugar from under his jacket; he put it into my hand, and said he had only taken it to eat; I called one of our men and gave the prisoner in his charge; I went and informed Mr. Craven of the circumstance; I was sent to Lambeth-street for a Police-officer, into whose charge the prisoner was given; I took this piece of sugar from him (producing it) I cannot swear to its being Mr. Craven's.
I am servant to Mr. Craven; Mr. Fryer gave the prisoner into my charge, and I saw him put down a large piece of sugar between two hogsheads; I cannot swear to it.
It is a kind of sugar that is only to be found in a sugar-house.
