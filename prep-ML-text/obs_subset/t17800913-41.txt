I live at Peterborough. I lost the things mentioned in the indictment. I sent them from Bedford to London by the Bedford waggon. They were to be left at the Bear and Ragged Staff in Smithfield. I saw them afterwards in the possession of Isaacs.
Upon the 24th of June, I saw one Martin Taylor , and the prisoner go along with bundles; I followed them to a pawnbroker's, there I took the things, mentioned in the indictment, from them. Martin Taylor was admitted king's evidence. I found the bag, the shoes, the stockings, great coat and the net, by the direction of the evidence, in Townsend's lodgings, on Saffron-hill.
On the 24th of June last, Townsend and I were out together between three and four o'clock in the morning; we met this waggon on the other side of Islington Workhouse ; I got up into it, and took this bag out, and we went to Townsend's; there we separated the things; he took one bundle and I carried two to the pawnbroker's. Isaacs and another constable came and took us there with the things upon us.
I was not with him, I only met him; he said they were his wife's things. I was not out with him.
