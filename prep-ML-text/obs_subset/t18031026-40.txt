- I am a fishmonger , No. 108, Drury-lane; the prisoner was my servant : On the 27th of August, he was sent with one hundred herrings to Cross-street, Blackfriars-road ; Mary Stevens bought them in the morning, she was to pay ten shillings for them; I told the prisoner he was to receive ten shillings; I sent him about six o'clock in the evening, and he came back about half past eight, saying, Mrs. Stevens did not pay him; it was about a fortnight, or three weeks, before I found it out; he never accounted to me for it; he left my service the same night; he was to have come again on Monday morning, but did not.
How long had the prisoner lived with you?
About twelve months.
Mrs. Stevens resides in the country of Surrey?
Yes.
I believe you yourself was inclined to settle the business?
At Marlborough-street, I wished the Magistrate to send him for a soldier or a sailor, to prevent the trouble of prosecuting him.
I live in Cross-street, over Blackfriars-bridge: On the 27th of August, I bought one hundred herrings of Mr. Barker; I was to pay ten shillings on delivery; the prisoner at the bar brought them between six and seven o'clock in the evening; I asked him if it would make any difference if I paid him part halfpence; he said, no, and I gave him either three shillings or three shillings and sixpence in halfpence, and the rest in silver; then he went away.
