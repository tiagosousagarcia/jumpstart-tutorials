I live at Clerkenwell workhouse: on the 20th of February I lost the things mentioned in the indictment; I was going up Baldwin's-gardens with my property, and the prisoner attacked me; he snatched the bundle from under my arm, and ran away.
I heard somebody cry, stop that boy; I stopped him.
I heard the cry of stop thief! and I ran, and they took me.
