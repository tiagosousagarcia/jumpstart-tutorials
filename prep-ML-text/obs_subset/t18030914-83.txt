What do you produce?
This is the certificate of the conviction of Samuel Beach, the prisoner, in the hand-writing of Mr. Shelton.
Do you know the person of the prisoner?
Yes.
Were you present when he took his trial?
Yes.
Is he the same person mentioned in the certificate?
Yes.
What became of him after his conviction, and how long did he remain in your custody?
He remained till the 14th of last February, and then he was delivered on board the hulks at Woolwich by me.
Do you know the prisoner?
I never saw him before we apprehended him, on the 6th of July last, in Piccadilly , opposite Bond-street.
Who was with you?
Marsden.
Was the prisoner going about at large?
Yes; he was going towards Hyde Park corner.
Are you sure he is the man?
Yes.
I have nothing to say; a man in my situation would do any thing to get away; I had not done any thing amiss when they took me, but was going to work till I could get a few things, and then I was going on board a man of war.
