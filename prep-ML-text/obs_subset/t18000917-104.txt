I live at No. 27, Leicester-square , I am a single woman; I was a servant there: On the 29th of August, the prisoner came to see a fellow-servant of mine; my watch was in my box, in a room in the kitchen; I was at my box, when my mistress called me up stairs; I went up stairs, and left my box open; when I came down, my watch was gone; I left Scott in the kitchen alone; when I missed my watch, I went in search of the prisoner, and found him at the Robin Hood , St. James's; I asked him what he had done with my watch, and he said, I was a fool; I told him, if he did not give it me, I would charge the watch with him; then, he said, he had only meant to frighten me; afterwards, he said, he had pawned it, that he did not think I would have followed him for two or three days; that I should know it was him that took it, and he meant to bring it back; he gave me the duplicate; I went to the pawnbroker's, and found the watch, but the seal was taken off; I immediately went back to his lodgings, and he said, he sent another man to pawn it for him, and it must be that man that took it off.
Were you intimate with this man?
No; he had come there for three weeks to see a gentleman's servant that lodged in the house; my mistress lets lodgings.
I am a pawnbroker in St. Martin's-lane, (produces a watch) I took it in of a genteel looking man, in a blue coat, in the name of John Doyle; it was not the prisoner; It had no seal to it.
This is my watch; I gave him a fortnight to find the man; I have never seen the seal since.
