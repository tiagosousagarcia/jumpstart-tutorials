I am a weaver ; on the 16th of September I lost two bobbins of silk; it was dyed, it was not raw silk, it was upon the bobbins; it was lost from the second floor; the prisoner is a stranger to me, I saw her there, I thought she was a bad woman; and when she went down I missed the silk and followed her, I took her and found the silk upon her; I am sure they are mine by the mark, which is J. A. she had them in her pocket, and said she had taken them; it was on the sabbath day, between three and four in the afternoon.
I saw her deliver the property to the man; she took it out of her pocket.
I know nothing of it.
