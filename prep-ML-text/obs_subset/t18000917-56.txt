I am the wife of William Williams ; I keep a haberdasher's shop, No. 10, Finsbury-place : On Wednesday, the 6th of August, about nine o'clock in the morning, I lost fifteen yards of lace; the prisoner came in for a yard of hair-ribbon; my little girl was in the shop; I came into the shop, and saw the prisoner take the lace out of the window, it was upon a card; I went towards him to ask him to give it me, and he put it under his coat and ran out of the shop; I ran after him, and called out to stop him; a gentleman that is here immediately stopped him, and I never lost sight of him; he was brought back, and I sent for a constable; the constable has got the lace.
I am a dealer in quills; I was coming from my house at Newington-green, and in Rope-maker's-street I heard a cry of stop thief; I took no notice of it till I heard it again; I turned round, and the prisoner passed me, and went up a court that was arched over; at the end of the arch-way I saw him throw something into a dust hole; he ran into the court, and finding it was no throughfare, he turned upon me; I held up a stick which I had put in my hand, and took him by the collar; I secured him, and delivered him and the lace to the constable.( William Waters , the constable, produced the lace, which was deposed to by Mrs. Williams.)
I am innocent of the charge.
