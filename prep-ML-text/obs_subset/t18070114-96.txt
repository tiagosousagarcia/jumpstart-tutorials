I live in Wentworth street, Whitechapel, I am a pawnbroker , I am in partnership with Elizabeth Price , she is my mother . On Monday the 8th of December, the prisoner came to our shop just before we shut up, and pledged a cloak for two shillings; we had folded up a great coat, it was on the counter just by were she stood, she took it away.
Did you see her take it away.
No, it was missed soon after she was gone, and suspicion fell upon her; I saw her the next morning about nine o'clock, I charged her with it, she told me she knew nothing about it. I sent for Mr. Griffiths the officer; she then owned that she pawned the coat at Mr. French's, White's row, Spitalfields.
I am a pawnbroker; on the 6th of December, about half past eight in the morning, the prisoner pledged the coat with me for five shillings.
When I went to Mr. Price's shop to redeem the cloak, he says, my dear, did not you take a cloak last night; he took me into the parlour, and with a great deal if persuasion I confessed. I was very much intoxicated, or else I would not have pledged it if I had known it was not honestly come by.
