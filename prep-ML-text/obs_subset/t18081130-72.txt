I am a police officer. On the 4th of November, in the evening, I was in company with Gleed and Valentine; I saw the prisoner in Shoreditch, he had a stick on his shoulder, and this basket on it; he was very near to a person that keeps an old iron shop, of the name of Revel, which is at the bottom of the gateway that goes out of the High street, Shoreditch; I followed him into the old iron shop; he throwed the basket off the stick on the counter; part of the copper went into the scale and part remained in the basket; I asked him where he got it, he seemed confused; I halloaed for Gleed and Valentine to come down to the shop; he begged that we would not take him in custody, he said he had found it somewhere in Bethnal green; I examined the basket, I could not see the least dirt on the basket; he begged that we would let him go, it would be the ruin of him; I told him I could not think of letting him go; he was taken to the office, and on the Saturday I found that he had been at work at Messieurs Trueman and Hanbury's in Brick lane; I went in company with Kennedy to Messieurs Trueman and Hanbury's brewhouse; we went up into the store room, there we compared some part of the copper to some of the copper remaining; it exactly corresponded.
You have heard Ray examined
Yes.
Did that parcel come from the prisoner
Yes; I was with Ray all the time; the prisoner begged we would let him go; for he came dishonestly by the copper; he said he would give us what money he had in his pocket, and what money he could raise besides; there is about forty pounds weight of copper.
I am a millwright.
Do you know any thing of the prisoner being at work at Trueman's brewhouse on the 4th of November
Yes; he was putting up a little desk in a closet.
Is the closet near the store room
It is quite up to the top, near the malt room.
Was there any copper in the closet
Yes, and brass.
I hope my lord you will have mercy upon me, if you please; I found this copper going home.
