I am servant to Mrs. Stringer; I can only identify the bag to be the property of Mrs. Stringer.
On Monday the 30th of December, some information came before the Lord Mayor, which induced him to send me to take the prisoner into custody, at Mrs. Stringer's warehouse, in Monument-yard ; I did so, and brought him to the Mansion-house, where I searched him; I found in his pocket, two keys, which he said were the keys of his boxes, at his lodgings, No. 3, Boar's-head-court, in the Borough; I went and found that he did lodge there; I went up stairs into his room, and in his boxes I found these things, (producing the articles mentioned in the indictment;) and among the rest, folded up in his box, was this bag, with some marks and numbers, which I thought right to take away; I have had them in my custody ever since.
I believe the whole of the property to be Mrs. Stringer's, but I cannot positively identify any article but the bag.
Had you missed the bag?
No.
Nor you cannot swear that any of the property was missing?
No.
Was that the only bag of that kind upon Mrs. Stringer's premises?
No; I suppose there were twenty; we never fell these sort of bags, we always make them up into smaller ones; we never sell them.
Might not Mr. Stringer, or any person in the house have given away that bag?
Not to my knowledge; this bag came with a lot in the Queen Indiaman; I have been twenty-two years in the house, and all that time they have never sold a bag.
Do you mean to swear that Mr. and Mrs. Stringer never gave away a bag?
Yes.
The bags are in the warehouse?
Yes.
And will you swear that the warehouseman might not have given any of them away?
He could not.
Upon the oath you have taken, have you not applied to get into the place of that man, if he is convicted, or get it for somebody else?
No, I have not.
