I am servant to Mr. Thomas Cannon ; he is a publican ; he lost the things in the indictment, two or three months back: he lives in Bishopsgate-street : the things were lost in the house: I had seen them before, a day or two: the silver spoon was missed on Sunday morning, the 24th of January; they were lost out of a place where the servants dine, next to the tap room: we do not know that he took them, only by his own confession: I heard him confess it upon telling him he should be cleared.
The prisoner used the house a good while: we always took him to be an honest man: I watched; and several things were missing; and three candlesticks and two tea spoons were missing; I cannot say to the day; I believe it was on a Monday morning; he was left in trust of the bar while my fellow servant went up the yard: I found nothing about him: he owned to the candlestick; a gentleman promised him; they said they would clear him.
I took him in custody. I received this spoon, which was found under the bench, in the tap-room, by his confession, on a promise of Mr. Cannon of forgiveness.
