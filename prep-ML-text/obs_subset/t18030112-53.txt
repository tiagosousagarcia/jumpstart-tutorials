- I am a pastrycook and confectioner , in Major Foubert 's Passage, Swallow-street: On the 23d of December, in the evening, I was up stairs at supper, I heard a terrible noise on the stairs, of somebody calling out; I went down stairs, and saw a mob, with my apprentice-boy bringing back the prisoner.
I am apprentice to Mr. Gann: I was standing at the bakehouse-door, and heard the latch of the shop-door go; I saw the prisoner come in, and take hold of the bone of ham that was in the shop, he ran towards Swallow-street; I cried, stop thief, and he was stopped by Mr. Thompson, a surgeon, I was not more than five yards from him: I am sure he was the same man, he had red facings to his great coat; I found the ham just where he had ran across.
(To Gann.) How many hams had you in the shop?
Only that one dressed, it weighed about eight pounds.
I am a shoe-maker, I work at Paddington, and I was in the care of a house in Hill-street, Betkeley-square: I went past this gentleman's house, and there was a man standing at the door; I had not got far, when I heard a cry out, and a man rushed by me; a gentleman stopped me, and I went immediately back with him.
