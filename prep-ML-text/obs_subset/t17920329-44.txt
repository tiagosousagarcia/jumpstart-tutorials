I keep a bacon shop the corner of Castle-street, Long-acre. I lost a ham the 23d of March; it hung at the door; I saw it about six in the afternoon; and I saw the prisoner take it off the hook at past six; I pursued him, and he was taken; he dropped the ham; he was taken in less than five minutes; he stared me full in the face; I was behind the counter; I do not know who gave me the ham again.
I stopped the prisoner in Mercer-street; he was running; he had nothing with him; three different people attempted to stop him, but could not; he said b - t your eyes, if you stop me, I will cut your head off; he fell.
He said at the justice that he would not positively swear I was the person, being dark, as I went past.
