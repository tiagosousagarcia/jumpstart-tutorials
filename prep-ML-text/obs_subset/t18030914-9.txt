I am an assistant-elder in the East India Company's warehouses, in Fenchurch-street the prisoner was a labourer ; I superintend the top floor; I had missed some teas; the floor was full of tea laid out to shew; I set William Brandon to watch, and the prisoner was detected.
I am a labourer in the warehouses; I was set to watch in the adjoining room on the top floor; I saw the prisoner go up to a chest of tea, pull off his shoes one at a time, put his hand into the chest, and take some tea, and put it into his shoes; when he had tied his shoes I came upon him, and took him down to the accompting-house; I saw him searched by an Excise officer, and the tea taken out of his shoes; he said he was very sorry for what he had done.(The tea was produced by Matthew White , the Excise officer.)
In walking among such a quantity of tea, some of it got into my shoes.
