- I live at No. 4, Crown-street, Finsbury-square ; my husband is a bedstead-maker : On the 26th of July last, I lost two gowns I had been washing that day, and they were hanging to dry; about two o'clock in the afternoon, I observed the prisoner at the bar standing at my gate, with an handkerchief tied across his head all over blood; I thought he wanted charity, he seemed much in distress; I went in to get him something; upon my return, he was gone, and two gowns; I immediately went to the gate, and heard he was gone down Long-alley; he was brought back by a witness of the name of Morris; the gowns were upon him.
- I was desired by Mrs. Price to go after the prisoner; I went down Long-alley to the Broker-row, and found him at the bottom of Broker-row; I laid hold of him, and asked him what he did with those things under his arm; he muttered something, and I brought him back with the gowns.(The constable produced the gowns.)
This is my gown; the other is Frances Frost's, my servant; I had washed them both.
I picked them up in the street.
