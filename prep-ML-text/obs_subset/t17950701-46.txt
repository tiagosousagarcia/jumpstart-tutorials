I am a watch and clock maker; on Monday evening, the 22d of June, between the hours of nine and ten. I was then within a few doors of my own home, when I perceived the prisoner, John Bradley , passing me, with an iron shore grate on his back; I had not gone many yards further before I see a hole belonging to an iron sewer, left entirely open, from that circumstance I suspected that he had stolen it; I resolved to follow him, which I did, to a house in James's street, Grosvenor-square; when I see him in the passage he was standing with his hands on the bar of the sewer grate; I went and informed the watchman in the street, and he went there and secured him. It was an iron grate, such as are over sewers in general, on the surface of the ground, fixed in under the pavement.
