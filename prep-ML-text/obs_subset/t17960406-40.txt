I am a linen-draper , in Oxford-street : I lost a gown-piece from the outside of my shop door, on the 8th of March; the prisoner was caught by a Mr. Jackson, and brought back.
On the evening of the 8th of March, I saw the prisoner unpin the cotton and walk a few yards beyond my door; she said, she had it given her by a woman; I told her, I saw her take it; she said, she had no husband, and several children; and begged I would let her go; I told her, I could not, and took her to Mr. Coates.
I have been driven to the greatest distress; I have begged in the street for bread for my children; I was five months in place; I have no friend here, but God and the Jury.
