I keep a public-house , No. 47, Great St. Andrew's-street, Seven Dials : The prisoner lived servant with me about ten weeks, I had a good character with him; I had a suspicion of him, I did not like to accuse him with an unjust thing: On Saturday, the 24th of December, I had a party of friends to dine; between six and seven o'clock, I left them, and attended to my business; a customer gave me a seven-shilling piece, with the letter A on the crown side; I laid it on the top of the beer machine, and went on the other side of the bar to take some change out of another till, gave the gentleman the remainder of the change that was coming to him, and wished him a good evening; I recollected I did not take the seven-shilling piece off the beer machine; no one had been inside the bar but the prisoner; I went into the room, and said, Joseph, did you take a seven-shilling piece off the beer machine; he said, no, I did not, sir; I said, no one else has been in the bar but you; the maid was standing by him, and I desired her to be very particular in sweeping out the bar in the morning: On Thursday, the 29th, I had been to Lambeth; when I came back, I had the prisoner searched; he said he was very sorry for what he had done, he should not have done it, but for the advice of a man, whose company I had often advised him to shun; the seven-shilling piece, and the other money, was found upon him.
I saw the prisoner produce a purse, containing a seven-shilling piece, with the letter A marked upon it, and the other money.
I picked it up in the passage.
