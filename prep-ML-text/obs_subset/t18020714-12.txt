I am a widow, I keep a shop , No. 36, Whitechapel road: On Monday the 7th of June, between two and three in the afternoon, I was going out of Cloth-fair into Long-lane , when the prisoner snatched my bundle from under my arm, behind me; it contained two yards and three quarters of velvet; he ran away, I ran after him all through Cloth-street, and then I lost fight of him; he was brought back to me in about seven or eight minutes; I am certain he is the same man.
Did you see him before he snatched the bundle;
Yes, I saw him by the posts.
Did you observe enough to be sure that the man that was brought back to you, was the same man that had snatched your bundle?
I am sure of it; the cloth was brought back at the same time; I have no doubt of it's being the same velvet.
I am a smith; I was standing at No. 26, King-street, Cloth-fair, on the 7th of June, between two and three o'clock, I heard Mrs. Phillips cry stop thief; I looked up the passage and saw the prisoner running with a parcel under his arm; I ran after him, and saw him drop the parcel, I picked it up; I then went after the prisoner; I lost fight of him in turning the corner; I afterwards saw him stopped; I am certain it was the same man that dropped the parcel, I know him by his dress; I delivered the parcel to Mr. Newman, at the Compter.
Do you think you should know the prisoner again?
I do not think I should; I did not take any particular notice of him.
I am a greengrocer; I heard a cry of stop thief, and saw the prisoner running with a parcel in a paper; I ran after the prisoner and called stop thief; I followed him to the corner of New-street; he took the parcel from under his right-arm, and threw it into the middle of the street; James Steele picked it up; he ran down New-street, into Little Bartholomew-close, he turned into a yard that was no thoroughfare, there he was stopped by two men, I don't know who they were; I went with him to the Compter; I am sure he is the same person I first saw running.
