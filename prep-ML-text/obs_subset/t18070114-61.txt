I am a seaman . On the 6th of January I brought my chest to Rebecca Cross, Blackwall , it was to lay there till it was called for; on the 7th I went to enquire for the chest, it was gone, I found the chest in a Gravesend boat on the 9th; the prisoner was going on board of an Indiaman, he was not on board at the time. I says who owns this chest, I had my key in my pocket, I found the lock broken open, I went on deck, I saw the prisoner come out of the alehouse, I asked him what was his name, he said John Johnson . I said you have robbed me of my chest; he said if I have got yours, I have left mine in the same house; he said you may have your chest, we went to the chest, he opened the padlock and took out what belonged to him. I found a jacket, a black coat, and some other articles; I said you have robbed my chest, and you shall not go unpunished by the laws of this country; he denied robbing the chest. I got an officer, he was taken before a magistrate, he confessed, and told where to find the woman that he had given the duplicates to, and the woman delivered the tickets to the officer.
Where does your mother live.
She keeps the sign of the East India house, Blackwall.
Do you remember this prosecutor leaving his chest there.
Yes, on the 6th of January.
What became of that chest.
The prisoner on the 7th of January came and took it instead of his own. Johnson's chest had his name on, and the prisoner's chest had his name on; my mother was busy, she thought he would take his own.
Are you sure that he is the man that took the chest away.
Yes.
It was in the night when I fetched the chest away; I was very drunk, I put the chest in a coach; the lock sprung up, and so I put a padlock on it.
