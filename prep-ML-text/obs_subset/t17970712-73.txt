I am warehouseman to Abraham Newman and William Thwaites, grocers , in Fenchurch-street: On the 3d of March, the prisoner brought an order in writing, and gave it me, I looked at it, and said, you want three pounds of nutmegs for Beacherost and Company, he said, yes; I told him to go over the way to the accompting-house, and get a bill of parcels for them, which he did; he went over the way, and Mr. Thwaites was in the accompting-house; Mr. Thwaites asked him what his name was, and he said his name was John Brown; he came back again to the warehouse, and I weighed him the nutmegs; he then went away.
Who are Messrs. Beachcroft and Company?
Beachcroft, Sockett and Company, I believe they live at Queenhithe.
Who is Smith?
I do not know.
It is not addressed to your house?
No.
Do not you know Beachcroft's hand writing?
No.
Were they customers of your's?
Yes.
You did not give him the nutmegs, did you?
Yes.
Did he take them away?
Yes.
Do you recollect what the words were that he said?
He did not say any thing, but gave me that order.
Upon what ground did you deliver him these nutmegs, in consequence of what he said, or in consequence of the note?
In consequence of both; when he first came into me, he said he was sent from the warehouse, to have a bill of parcels of them; I then asked him, why should Beachcroft and Company send for three pounds of nutmegs; he said, because they wanted some large ones for shipping; I then asked him what his name was, and he told me it was John Brown, upon which the bill of parcels was given him.
What is your partnership?
No other person has any interest in the business but Mr. Abraham Newman.
If this man had come without this written paper, you would not have delivered them?
No
Then it was only in consequence of his bringing that paper, that you delivered the goods?
I should not without asking a great many questions.
It was both together that induced you to deliver them?
Yes.
