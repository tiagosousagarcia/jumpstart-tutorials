On Monday night, between nine and ten, I entered my house, and saw the prisoner; I live in Bridges-street, Covent Garden ; on coming in, and seeing a stranger, I asked who was there; he said, a friend; the maid, on hearing my voice, ran up much agitated; the prisoner was searched, and in his breeches was found a silk cloak.
I am servant to Mr. Lonsdale; the cloak is mine; I was at home, but did not know any person was in the house; the cloak was up three pair of stairs.
I was sent for on Monday last; to Mr. Lonsdale, to search the prisoner, and found this cloak in the prisoner's breeches; I have had it ever since.
