I am a widow; I keep a chandler's shop , No. 6, Brick-lane, Whitechapel . I was not at home the time it happened.
I am son to the last witness. On Friday the 29th of December the prisoner came in for an ounce of tea, as I was taking down the cannister I saw him take the paper of starch from off the window and run out, I ran after him and halloaed out, stop thief; he was stopped; I picked up the starch.
What became of the man
Somebody threw him down. When I came up to him I found him down and the starch fell on the ground; I took up the starch and gave it to the constable.
I am a baker. On Friday the 29th of December I heard the cry of stop thief, I ran to the door, I saw a porter trip the prisoner up, he fell with the paper of starch under him; young Rothery picked the paper of starch up; I secured him.
I am innocent; I never had the paper of starch. I was running along, I heard somebody call out, I turned round to see and somebody knocked me down directly.
