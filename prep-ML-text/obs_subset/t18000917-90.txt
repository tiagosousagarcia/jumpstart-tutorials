I am a sailor : I was robbed on Sunday last of the articles mentioned in the indictment; I went from Mr. Levy's house, No. 85, Little Tower-hill , to take a walk; I came back in the afternoon, about one o'clock, and missed my property from the bed-room; the prisoner lodged in the same room; the next day, as I was going to take a walk, I met the prisoner at no great distance from the Tower; I went up to him; and told him, he was the man I wanted, and found my shoes on his feet; I took him to Mr. Levy's house; he acknowledged he had pawned or sold the trowsers, and the shirt; I told him, I would not hurt him, if he would tell me where the things were, but he would not.
Drewee lodged with me, he is a Switzerland man; the prisoner lodged with me two or three months before Drewee, I always found him a very honest man; on Sunday morning, I saw the prisoner in the shop; about twelve o'clock, he had not slept at home on the Saturday night; I had several times given him leave to wear my shoes and boots; on Sunday morning, I saw him with a large pair of shoes on, and a pair of stockings; I asked him how he came by those shoes; he said Drewee had lent them to him, and he went out; when Drewee came back, he missed the property in the indictment; I saw no more of him till Drewee brought him into my house, about ten or eleven o'clock on Monday morning; I don't think he would have done it, but he was in liquor, and he wanted to go to see his sweetheart on Sunday, which made him put these things on; he was so very much in liquor, that he could not tell what he had done with the things.
I was very much in liquor on the Saturday night, and I asked Drewee to lend me some clean things to go out with; he said, he would; I went up into the room, but could not find him, and I took them; I went out, and spent the day with my friend that I had got intoxicated with, and, as I was coming home on the Sunday evening, I met with a girl that asked me to go home and sleep with her, which I did, and when I got up in the morning, I had got nothing left but the shoes; I told Drewee that I would make him any recompence in my power. (The shoes were produced, and deposed to by the prosecutor).
