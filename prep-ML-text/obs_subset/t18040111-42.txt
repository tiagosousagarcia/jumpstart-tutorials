I am a labouring woman; I live in Whitechapel ; the prisoner lodged in the same room, and worked at slop-work; I lost my cloak on the 2d of January; she lodged with me from Saturday till Monday; I found it at the pawnbroker's.
She lent me the cloak to pledge it, and had half the money.
(To Downey.) Did you lend her the cloak?
No.
