The prisoner was brought into my shop: I was informed by the persons that brought him back that he had stolen a Stilton cheese from me; he said he had not stole it, but afterwards acknowledged that he had.
Did you make him any promise?
No; it was voluntary.
I am servant to Mr. Hixon: On the 10th of May two gentlemen brought a Stilton cheese and the prisoner into the shop; this is the cheese; (producing it;) I know it to be my master's property.
I am a constable: On the 10th of May, about seven in the evening, I was going through the Strand , and saw the prisoner standing at Mr. Hixon's door; after I had passed him, I turned round, and saw him take the cheese from Mr. Hixon's door; he came towards me with it, and I stopped him, and took him back to Mr. Hixon's shop, and there he denied it for some time; at last he confessed it.
I am not the man: I was committed by a prosecutor from Westminster.
Is he the man?
He was not in soldier's clothes at that time, and I really cannot say; he was dressed in very shabby clothes.
He is very much like the man in the face; but he is so altered, from being very dirty at the time he was taken, that I cannot ascertain; he is very much like the man, but the man that I took was very much knock-knee'd.
This man is very straight.
Then he is not the man.
