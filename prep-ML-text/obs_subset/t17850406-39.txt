I am a Custom-house-officer, at Parker's garden and warehouses, belonging to the East India House, on the 11th of March, I took a parcel of Hyson tea, one pound and two ounces, out of the pocket of the prisoner, it was loose; he is a Company's labourer .
I am one of the Company's labourers, I was in the warehouses, and I saw the prisoner take the tea out of the chest, and put it in his pocket, there were four or five people on the same floor: we were going up to work, we had not begun, I gave notice first to Mr. Butcher, and then to Mr. Griffiths, I saw the tea taken out of his pocket, it belongs to the Company, it was unsold tea.
How many people were in the warehouse at this time?
Four, five, or six.
Did they stand near the prisoner?
Not very near, they were on the same floor.
How near?
As far again as I may be from you.
I saw the prisoner take the tea out of the chest, and put it into his pocket.
I gathered the tea about the place, I did not take it out of the chest.
You as a labourer about there, knew very well you had no right to take any tea that was there.
