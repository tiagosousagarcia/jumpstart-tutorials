I let the prisoner a lodging at 2 s. 6 d. per week, it was furnished, there was a woollen rug, two flat-irons, and a copper tea-kettle; I gave her the irons on the 22d, on the 23d I asked her for the rent; I thought something was missing, and I called in the patrol and searched the lodging, and all the things were missing.
I produce a pair of sheets pawned by the prisoner, one on the 16th, and the other on the 23d; I am a pawnbroker, I know the prisoner, she said they were her own, she had lately received them from the country.
