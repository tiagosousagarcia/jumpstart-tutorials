I am servant to Mr. Gibson, linen-draper, in St. Martin's-lane.
How old are you?
Fifteen; I was sent of an errand to Red-lion-street, Holborn, on Saturday, the 15th of November, between ten and eleven in the evening: upon my return home, I had to call in Plumbtree-street; I came home through Dyot-street , where I was met by two girls; they stopped me, shoved me up against the wall, and the prisoner snatched the watch out of my pocket, and gave it to the other; I immediately got hold of her, and told her I insisted upon having the watch.
Did the other hold you at all?
Yes; she said; she had not got the watch, nor did not know any thing about it; I told her she had it, and if she would not give it me, I would charge the watch with her; I then called the watchman, and he came and took her; I have never found my watch again.
Did you speak to these girls first, or did they speak to you first?
No, they spoke to me; they wanted me to go a little way with them, for they wanted to speak to me, and,upon my refusing to go, they shoved me up against the wall immediately.
I am a watchman: Just after I had cried the hour of ten o'clock, I heard the cry of watchman; I took charge of the prisoner, and took her to the watch-house, that is all I know of it.
I have nothing to say; there was another woman with him before I came up.
I am a tailor, I have known the prisoner from a child, her father died about six months ago; he knew she was a girl that had not acted circumspect, and he made over his property to a younger daughter, and this girl was left unprovided for; I took her into my house, and she might have defrauded me if she had chose so to do; I always found her honest.
