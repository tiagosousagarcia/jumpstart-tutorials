On the 21st of January, the prisoner at the bar brought a piece of muslin; he wanted to pledge it for a guinea and a half; he said he lived in Lothbury, kept a linen-draper's shop; I wrote the duplicate, and gave my man the money, and told him to go and see if the prisoner lived there; when my man had got his hat, he said, Sir, I will not give you the trouble; I have taken it from Mr. Coulthard's warehouse, where he lived servant; he said he expected some money from the country in the ensuing week, and then he meant to restore it; I sent for his master, and he has left the muslin with me (the muslin produced); there was a letter in his pocket, importing that money would come.
The prisoner has lived with me twenty-one months, as errand-boy and warehouse-man ; I know the muslin by the mark G (deposed to the muslin) he never lived in any place in London before mine.
Mr. Crouch, you have acted in this case with much propriety; you merit the thanks of the Court.
