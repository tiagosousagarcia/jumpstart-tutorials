I live in Bell-Yard, Temple-Bar ; the prisoner lodged in my house; she came some time last year, I do not know the day nor the month; Mary Smith lodged in the room with her some months; I missed the things mentioned in the indictment, on the third of March, out of the two pair of stairs back room, which was the room they occupied; the prisoner was in the lodging, the other was absent on some business I believe; my wife had occasion to go into the room, and missed the things.
I am wife to Thomas Clark ; I let the lodgings to the prisoner and Mary Smith ; I missed the things mentioned in the indictment, on the third of March.
I am servant to Mr. Pharez, a pawnbroker in Fleet-Market; I have here a kettle and a sheet, which I took in of the prisoner; the blanket was taken in by a person before I lived there, in the name of Mary Nicholls , in October; the sheet came in February, and the kettle in December.
In what name did the prisoner pawn the sheet and kettle?
Elizabeth Nicholls .
The other person was gone to receive some money, and then I meant to redeem them.
