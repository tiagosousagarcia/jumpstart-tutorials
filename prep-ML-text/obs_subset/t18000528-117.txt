I am butler to Mr. Nathaniel Middleton , No. 47, Portland-place ; I was not at home at the time the spoon was taken.
I am servant to Mr. Middleton; the prisoner at the bar came with some wine to my master, there were some spoons laid upon the table in the pantry; after he was gone, there was one missing, he was not in soldier s clothes at that time.
On Friday the 23d of May, the prisoner came to his quarters, got drinking, and made a disturbance that somebody had robbed him of a silver spoon; upon searching, they found a silver spoon upon the coal-box, which he swore was his, seeing the crest upon it, I took charge of it, and the next morning, learning that he had been to Mr. Middleton's, I sent it there, and it turned out to be his.
I am a constable, I received this spoon from Mr. Shepherd, (produces it;) the prisoner said, d-n my eyes if that is not my spoon now.
I found the spoon, at the corner of Portland-street.
This is Mr. Middleton's crest; I counted over the spoons and found one short of the number, I have brought the fellow to it.
