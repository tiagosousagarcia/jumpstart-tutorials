I live at Badgworth, in Gloucestershire: I was present when the prisoner was married to Ann Lowe .
Is she now living?
I have seen her about two years ago.
Are you sure you have seen her within three years?
Yes;
my father is clerk of the parish, I was about eleven years of age at the time; the minister of the parish delivered this book to me.
I was present when the prisoner was married, on Twelfth-day, about nine years ago, to Mary Drake , at St. George, Hanover-square; I know his person perfectly well.
I saw Ann Lowe, on the 17th of May last.
My first wife and I agreed to part; Mary Drake is my lawful wife.
