I am a ship owner and broker , I live in Water lane, Tower street.
Where did you lose these things from.
From on board the ship Speedwell in the river Thames; I was on board the ship a month ago, I went for the officer, and when the prisoner was going along with him he acknowledged his taking it.
I am a police officer; I know no more than the owner told me there was a man on board the ship that stole some tobacco, he pointed out the prisoner to me, and said he is your prisoner; I said to the prisoner how came you to be so foolish to do such a thing, I have known you a great while; he said that he saw the bale open, he took a little for himself and partner; the prisoner was a revenue officer on board that ship; this is an article of foreign tobacco, which is shipped for exportation.
Did you find any thing on him.
I did not, the mate is gone to sea who saw the transaction.
