I am a carpenter: On Tuesday, the 5th of October, I was told a person was robbing me, or my employer; on the 8th, about a quarter past eight, when all the workmen should be at break fast, I went to Mr. Swinton's premises in Salisbury-square , and caught the prisoner with three iron bars in his hand, tied up, which he had brought from the adjoining house, belonging to a copper, they were on Mr. Swinton's premises; the prisoner was a bricklayer , and at work there; I asked him what he was going to do with them; he said, to take care of them; I asked where he had them from; he said, from the still; I found the three other bars hid behind some old stuff; I examined them, and they did not belong, to the still, but to the copper; both houses belong to Mr. Swinton.
I live near Mr. Swinton, and watched the prisoner: On the 8th of October, after the carpenters were gone, I saw the prisoner peep betwixt the rafters, and look about; he came up with his handkerchief in his hand, and went back with three bars in his hand; he went a second time, and returned with something under his coat; I informed Mr. Pitcher, who detected him.
I know nothing about them any more than a child unborn.
