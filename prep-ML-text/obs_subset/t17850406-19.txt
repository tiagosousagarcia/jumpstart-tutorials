I am wife of James Biggs ; I went out and left my door not locked, about five in the afternoon; nobody was at home but the lodgers; the prisoner lived in one of my rooms, and Elizabeth Evans in the other: the prisoner was at home when I went out; I left the watch hanging on the mantle piece; I returned in about ten minutes, and missed the watch; I left the other lodger in care of the door, I told her the watch hung up: the prisoner was not at home when I came in: the watch was found at the pawnbroker's, by Mary Dilnot .
I was left in care of the watch by the prosecutor's wife, and I shut the street door, and I went into my own apartment; and presently I found the outside door had been opened on the inside, it could not be opened but from the inside; I heard or saw nobody; I stopped the watch afterwards in the Minories.
I was coming by, and the prosecutor's wife was crying out about her watch, and she asked me to go to see for it; and I went and found the prisoner at a pawnbroker's pawning the watch; I knew the watch, I had several times seen it: the prisoner said nothing; and the pawnbroker in the prisoner's presence said, she brought the watch there; she said nothing; and he gave her the watch, and she took it, and gave it to Mrs. Biggs.
The prosecutor's wife gave me this watch to pledge: the pawnbroker I believe is here.
I subpoened him this morning.
Did any such thing pass at the pawnbroker's, as the prisoner has said?
No it did not, I am sure of that.
Though the pawnbroker is not here, if any such thing passed in his presence, he can prove it hereafter?
No such thing passed.
Did you ever desire her to pledge this watch?
No.
Did you ever tell the pawnbroker that you had desired her to pledge it?
No, he asked me if I knew that watch; I told him I could swear to it.
When Mr. Biggs came home, he said they had done it very clever, and if they stuck to what they had done, they would get forty pounds, or a Tyburn ticket.
