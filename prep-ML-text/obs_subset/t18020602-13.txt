The prisoner came to my shop, on the 19th of May, about six o'clock in the evening, to buy a pair of shoes; I shewed him several pair, but none would suit him; after staying about a quarter of an hour, he went away; as soon as he was gone, I missed a redcloth waistcoat from a shelf; the next evening he came again; I charged him with having stolen a waistcoat; he denied it; I sent for a constable, and gave charge of him; he then confessed he had stolen two, and sold them to one Mr. Carson, in Rosemary-lane, for 7s. 6d.; I went to Mr. Carson's, and he sent me them by Mr. Fearnley, and I sent him the money he had paid for them; the red waistcoat I can swear to; the other I cannot.
I am a salesman, and live opposite Mr. Norden; I received these waistcoats from Mr. Carson, and delivered them to Mr. Norden.
On the 20th of May the prisoner came, about the middle of the day, and brought me these two waistcoats to sell; I gave him seven shillings and sixpence for them.
They told me they would forgive me, if I told the truth.
