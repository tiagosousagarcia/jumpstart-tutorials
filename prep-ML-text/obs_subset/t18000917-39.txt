I am a merchant's watchman upon the Quays: On Saturday, the 2d of August, I saw the prisoner at work in a lighter at Wiggins's-quay ; I saw him take some coffee out of the cask and put it into a small bag, and put it into his pocket; I went up to him and asked him what he had got about him; he said, nothing; I searched him and found this coffee upon him, in a small bag; there is about three or four pounds of it; I do not know whose coffee it is; I could not find out; I sent for the constable, and he was secured.
I was at work in a lighter, and after she was worked out, I found this coffee spilt about, and it would have been trod upon and spoiled if I had not picked it up; I did not know that I was doing any harm.
(To Hunter.) Did he take it out of the cask, or off the floor of the lighter?
Out of the cask,
