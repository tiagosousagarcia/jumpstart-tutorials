I am clerk to John Moseley , he is a mechanical tool manufacturer , No. 16, New-street, Covent Garden , in the parish of St. Martin's in the Fields. On the 9th of January, between five and six in the evening, I was in the accounting house, I saw the prisoner in the shop, walking towards the door with a tool chest from off the counter; I went into the shop; he asked the price of it; he had almost got out of the door before I came up to him; I told him by his appearance he did not want to purchase it, he meaned to convey it out of the shop; he then begged my pardon, I secured him.
What is the value of the chest of tools
Above three guineas.
I went into that gentleman's shop and knocked three times, and when he looked up I took up the chest; as soon as he came to me I asked him the price of it; he said I wanted to thieve it.
