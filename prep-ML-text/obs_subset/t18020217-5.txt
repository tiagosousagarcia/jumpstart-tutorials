You are ostler to Mr. Pring, who keeps livery-stable in Coleman-street?
I am.
Do you know the young man at the bar?
Yes, perfectly well: On the 13th of August, the prisoner at the bar hired a black mare of me to go to Dartford, it was Mr. Pring's mare, bridle and saddle, he was to return the next day; I delivered the mare to him at Moorgate Coffee-house; I continued in Mr. Pring's service thirteen days after, but he did not return during that time.
What age was this mare?
Four years old; I saw the same mare to-day, at the Crosskeys, Wood-street, in the care of Mr. Fairer, she appeared to have been very ill used; she was worth seventeen or eighteen guineas, I believe, when he hired her of me.
You live at the King's-arms, at Liverpool?
Yes.
Do you know the young man at the bar?
Yes; I saw him at Liverpool; on Wednesday the 19th of August, he came to the King's-arms, on horseback, it was a black mare; she appeared to have been rode very hard, and very ill spurred in the sides; he rode out chiefly every morning till the Monday morning after, and then he went out upon her, and did not return; the bill of the house being not paid, I was sent to see if I could find her, I found her in Mr. Fairer's stables, in Derby-street, Liverpool; I went back and told them the mare was there, and my master sent me to fetch her back, and the next day the prisoner came and gave me an order upon Mr. Fairer to receive three guineas.
What name did the prisoner go by at that time?
Captain Lynn.
What was the\\ amountof his bill?
Three pounds nine shillings and nine-pence; in consequence of that, Mr. Fairer paid me the three guineas, and I delivered the house to Mr. Fairer; he paid the rest of the monacy to the waiter.
Where is the mare now?
I saw her today, at the Cross-keys.
Was that the same black mare?
It was.
By what name did he hire the horse?
M'Alenan.
You live in Derby-street, Liverpool?
I do.
Look at the prisoner - Did you ever see him at Liverpool?
I cannot say that that is the same man, it was a young person about his size that came to me between the 20th and 24th of August last.
Look at him again?
I think I have seen him before, I believe he is the same man, but I am not quite positive; he came, and said, he was recommended by a gentleman, in Castle-street, Liverpool, to have his horse kept at my stables, while he went to the lsle of Man; he did not know the gentleman's name, but I have seen him since; his name is Swist, he told me his own name was Captain Lynn.
Did you take in the mare?
Yes, it was a black mare, I brought her up to town with me; Spooner and Plant have seen her at the Cross-keys, she is now in the yard.
What became of the mare afterwards?
I let him have four guineas upon the mare, and then Plant came and paid me the seven guineas that I had advanced, and took her away; I saw nothing of the prisoner afterwards.
Did you ever know of my hiring horses of Mr. Pring before?
Yes.
Did I ever run a bill without its being discharged?
No.
Did I not send the horses home without riding them myself?
Yes, once or twice.
I believe you are the owner of the mare which Spooner let to the prisoner?
Yes; I saw her to-day in the possession of Mr. Fairer; I saw nothing of the prisoner till I saw him in custody at Lambeth-street Office, about two months ago; I was sent for by the Magistrates.
From the 13th of August, till you saw him in custody, had he ever been with you to explain what was become of the mare?
No.
Was the mare such a mare as you would have lent to go such a journey as Liverpool?
Certainly not.
Was she able to go so long a journey?
No, by no means, her age would not have permitted it.(James Lynn was called upon his subpoena, but did not appear.)
On Thursday the 13th of August, I sent the waiter of the Moorgate Coffee-house to Mr. Pring's, to know if I could have a horse to go to Dartford, in Kent; Mr. Pring's man brought a black mare, which I mounted; I told him I was going to Dartford, I told him I should return probably to-morrow evening; I went to Dartford in expectation of returning next day; when I got to Dartford, I had the misfortune to meet with a brother of mine, who was a lieutenant on board his Majesty's ship, Charlotte; he told me, he heard that the ship I belonged to, the Charger, was going to sail; I desired him to ride the mare to town, supposing I could put confidence in my brother, and told him to return the horse to Mr. Pring; I gave him a guinea to pay for it; I always paid Mr. Pring half-a-guinea a day; I rested satisfied that the horse was returned, and went off the next morning with the coach for Plymouth; I understood afterwards, that my brother had gone to Liverpool, and sold the mare there; I have since learnt, that, at that time, he had lost his commistion, but I did not then know it; I heard, about a fortnight ago, that he is in America.
My Lord, I understand, Mr. Lynn is come now.
Do you know the prisoner?
I have seen him before.
You know him well?
No, I don't.
Don't you know him well?
I have seen him.
Why, is he not a relation of your's?
I don't know that that is a proper question.
Yes it is?
I have known him since he came to town, he said he was related to me.
Has he not lived with you?
He lived with me eighteen months.
Do you know his hand-writing?
No.
Did you never see him write?
I never observed him write, he wrote a very bad hand when he was with me.
Do you know his hand-writing when you see it?
No. I do not.
Look at the prisoner - is he the man who came to your house at Liverpool?
He is like the man.
Have you any doubt of his being the man?
No, I have not.
