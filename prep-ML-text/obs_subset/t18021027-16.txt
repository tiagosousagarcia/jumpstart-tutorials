I am warehouseman to John Jackson and William Jackson ; the prisoner occasionally worked on the wharf: On Saturday, the 17th of this month, in consequence of suspicion, seeing the prisoner with a basket, I called to him, and asked what he had got; he said, only a little straw; I told him I must see what he had got, and a bag of nalls immediately fell out of the basket; it is such a bag as they are usually packed in; it was marked S. I. and G. underneath; I missed the bag from the warehouse up stairs; I had put it there in the morning.
I had the basket to get some straw; I had occasion to go into Mr. Maynes to get some money that was owing me; I let the basket at the door, and when I came out I picked it up, not knowing there was anything in it but straw.
