I am foreman to Mess. John and Philip Perry , ship-builder s; I know of no other partners; I am a watchman in dock; I took the prisoner with a sack on his shoulder, he came from the other side of the yard; he came in through the yard gate, it was open, I saw him, but he did not see me; I stood close by the gate; I stopped him and asked him where he was going with that tackle, it was open on his shoulders; he made me no answer; I threatened him to tell an officer, and I took him to the watch-house, and the tackle with him.
