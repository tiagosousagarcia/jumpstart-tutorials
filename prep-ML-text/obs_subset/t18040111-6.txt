I live at No. 1, Church-row, St. Luke's : On the 4th of January I lost a japan chair from a set of half a dozen; I know nothing of the loss.
I am a chair-maker: Yesterday was a week the prisoner brought me a chair to sell; she asked me 5 s. 6 d. I asked her if she had any more of them; she said, she had half a dozen, and she would sell them one at a time, she was in distress; being a new chair, I suspected it was stolen; I went to several chair-makers, and at last found Mr. Brinckworth had lost a chair; he came with me to look at the chair, and he owned it. - (Produces it.)
This is my chair.
I took charge of the prisoner; she said the chair was her own, that her husband had bought it, and brought it home; she would not tell me her name nor where she lived; I told her she must go to the Magistrate's, and as we went along, she gave the name of Mary Brown ; before the Magistrate, she gave the name of Mary Smith .
I never said I had a husband at all.
