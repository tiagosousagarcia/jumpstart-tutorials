I am groom and footman to Mr. M'Murray, he lives at Homerton .
What is the boy
He works on the premises as a labourer to Mr. M'Murray. On Saturday evening the 28th of November, between six and seven, I was looking after the horses; I missed the coat out of the yard.
I take in washing. On Monday morning at eight o'clock the boy brought a coat to be altered; I told him I could not alter it; he told me he found it Mr. Bishop's field; on Wednesday I heard there was such a coat cried. I took it to Shephard.
On Wednesday morning I cried the coat. I met Mrs. Banks coming out of the house with it. (The coat identified.)
Please you, my lord, I was crossing Mr. Bishop's field, I went to the dunghill to ease myself; I pulled it out from one corner of the dunghill.
