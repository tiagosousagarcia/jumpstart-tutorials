- I am a grocer in Redlion-street, in the parish of Christ-Church : On Friday the 27th of June, I was standing behind the counter, the prisoner came into the shop and asked for a quarter of a pound of chocolate; I served her with the chocolate, and she laid me down a guinea to pay for it; I took up the guinea and gave her change, I took eighteen-pence for a quarter of a pound of chocolate, and the change I gave her was two seven-shilling-pieces, some silver, and some halfpence, to make up the difference, there might be sixpennyworth, I cannot say how many; after the change was given, she refused one seven-shilling-piece, I changed that for another; then she refused the other; and likewise said that that was bad; I changed that also.
Where was the guinea?
I had it in my till; after I had changed the gold she began to look at the silver, she first said three shillings were bad; in fact, she said the whole was bad; I felt myself very much irritated, and I insisted upon the change back, and looking at it, threw down the guinea that I had received of her, and she put it in her pocket; she made a great deal of hesitation, and refused to return the change; she then said, if I would give the change that I had given her upon my word, she would take it; I told her I certainly would, that it was good; she then took the change and went out of the shop with the guinea.
Gentlemen, you see it was taken with his consent by the woman.
