I am a baker , at Whitechaplel: My servant lost the bread in the street; I was not present.
On the 19th of February, I was out with bread for my master; I pitched my basket the corner of George-yard ; I left it five or ten minutes; when I came back I missed four quartern loaves, and one sixpenny one; I met a young man, and he told me they were gone over to the London Apprentice, which is about an hundred yards from where my basket was; I went over, and there was the prisoner with them; I know them by the make of them, and the marks both; he said, he took them in joke.
Did you know him before?
Yes; I knew him by sight, but I had no acquaintance with him.
It was a very little time before that we were drinking together.
That is about six months ago, and that is the only time I ever was in company with him in my life before; he was with an acquaintance of mine, and we had a pot of porter together.
I saw the prisoner run from the basket, with four quartern loaves, and a sixpenny one, over to the London Apprentice; I waited till the young man came to his basket, and I told him of it; he ran with them as hard as he could run across the street.
Was he dressed like a baker at that time?
He had a green coat on rather sloury.
I took charge of the prisoner: I asked him, if he knew any thing of the bread, and he said, yes; he took it in pastime.
What I said then I don't know, because I was frightened; I went to the public-house, and the young man asked me about his bread; I said, I might have taken it out of a joke, but I had not taken it; the bread was in the parlour; he went, and said, it was his bread; he went away, and the next day he took me up for it.
