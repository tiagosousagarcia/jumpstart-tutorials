, the elder, sworn. - I am an upholsterer , in London-wall ; I am in partnership with my son; the prisoner was one of our work women: In consequence of suspicion, having missed several pieces of cotton, I went to the prisoner's lodgings, and found a bed-curtain, and some duplicates, which led to other property.
I am foreman to Messrs. Phene; I was sent for to see a piece of furniture in the prisoner's apartments, which I knew to be my master's property.
I am a pawnbroker: On the 26th of August, I took in the valance of a bed from the prisoner; I lent her sixpence upon it; she had used our shop some months.
Here are other articles pledged by the prisoner, but the persons who took them in are not here; I know this valance to be my master's property.
