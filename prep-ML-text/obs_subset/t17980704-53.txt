I live in Peter-street, Westminster : On the 28th of May, I went down into the cellar to get up some wood, and when I came up again I saw the prisoner at my till; I laid hold of him, and took three-pence halfpenny out of his hand, all my silver was gone that I had taken in the course of the day, I think there was about three shillings, or three shillings and sixpence, and a great quantity of halfpence; I had looked in the till about an hour or two before.
I had been receiving my pay along with a witness who is here, and we went into a house for some porter, and I went out to get some bread and cheese; I went into the prosecutor's shop with three-pence halfpenny in my hand, there was nobody in the shop, and I was looking about for somebody, when this gentleman came up, and said I was robbing his till.
I was paid five shillings and sixpence along with the prisoner; he had a very remarkable half-crown, and I asked him if it was a dollar, and he said no; we went to the Black-lion together, and then he went out to get some bread and cheese.
How much money did you find upon him?
About five shillings.
Was the till open?
Half open.
