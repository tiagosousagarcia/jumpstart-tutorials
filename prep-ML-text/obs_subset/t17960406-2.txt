I am a linen-draper , No. 96, Whitechapel , in partnership with James Aldred; we don't keep house together; James Aldred keeps the house; the shop belongs to both of us: The things were taken out of the shop on Monday the 14th of March; we missed from a shelf in the shop about thirteen yards of Irish linen; and, as we had not had occasion for any from the Sunday, I suspected the prisoner; she was servant to Mr. Aldred; I mentioned it to her mistress; she sent her out for a few minutes, and went up stairs and examined her room; she brought down a parcel of linen; by its appearance, I thought it was the linen we had lost; I sent to the Police-office for a constable, against she came back, we searched her room, I was present, and part of the things were found in her room under the bed, and a part of them in her box; the other articles were under the bed; there were several other aticles, but these were what we could swear to, having our private marks; and she was taken to the office.
I am a Police officer: I found these thing in the prisoner's room; I have had them ever since.
How do you know that this room was the prisoner's?
Her mistress told me she slept there.
Was any thing said by her about this being her room?
Yes; she said it was her room, and she said where she took them from, from different parts of the shop.
Did you make use of any promises or threats, to induce her to confess?
Certainly not.
Who said it was her room?
Herself.
How many servants are there in the house?
One young man, but he never sleeps up stairs.
The door is generally open, that any body may have access to it?
I cannot say.
Every body in the house might go into that room.(For the prisoner.)
I have known the prisoner seven years; she came to my house first, as a servant; she lived with me about three-quarters of a year; she was very honest while she lived with me, and she has been in my house an hundred times since, and I never saw or heard any thing against her.
