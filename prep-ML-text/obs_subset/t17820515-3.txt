I keep a house in Spital-fields Market . On the 23d of April, between the hours of eight and nine o'clock in the evening, I was called into my dwelling-house, upon the alarm of thieves being in the house; I went up stairs; I missed the things mentioned in the indictment. From the one pair of stairs room I went up into the back-garret; there I found the prisoner; she had lived with me as a servant about ten weeks, but had been discharged from my service about three months before; the prisoner was lying upon the ground, and appeared to be attempting to get under the bed; the several articles mentioned in the indictment lay by her, loose; she was taken off the floor: after some time she fell upon her knees, and begged for mercy.
I lodge in the prosecutor's house. As I was coming down stairs, a little after eight in the evening, with a candle in my hand, there was some person coming out of the back-chamber door, but, seeing me, shut the door in my face very hard. I went down, and enquired of the family if any body was gone up stairs; they said, no; then I thought some thieves had got into the house; I directed the prosecutor to be called in; I went up stairs into the garret with him; there we found the prisoner lying on the floor, upon her face; the several things lay just by the prisoner.
I followed the prosecutor, upon this alarm, up stairs; I pulled the prisoner up from the floor; she begged for mercy.
I beg for mercy.
