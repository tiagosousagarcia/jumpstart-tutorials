I am a gardener to Mr. Vickery at Edgeware : I know the prisoner; we missed some hay from Mr. Vickery's, we set up to watch. About three o'clock in the morning, the prisoner came to the rick, and cut some hay, and took it away; we took him with the hay upon him; he said he took it for his horses, but he had a sufficient quantity cut for him.
I took it for my master's horses, for I had not sufficient.
