I am a painter , I live in Harp lane, Tower street. Last night, about nine o'clock, I arrived from Gravesend; the first part of my passage I was in the aft part of the vessel, I left the aft cabin and came upon deck, and I left my bundle in the care of William Whitehead , we had some friends in the boat, I went into the fore hold, and William Whitehead came to me; I told him to go and get the bundle, he went, and then he replied it was gone; I went on shore, and the watchman who is here, told me he saw a man go by with a bundle and a hat in his hand; I overtook the prisoner at Aldgate pump, I asked him how he came to take these things from the Billingsgate boat, he replied, he had a bundle in the boat, he took them in mistake.
I walked from Chatham to the Gravesend boat, then I came up to London in the boat, I was half tipsey when I went on board, and in the room of taking my own bundle I took this gentleman's; I lost my own at the same time.
The captain said there was no bundle left in the vessel; he appeared to be rather in liquor when I took him.
