I am a cheesemonger , I lost a cheese on Monday forenoon last, I live in High-street, St. Giles's ; I found the cheese upon the prisoner, I saw him loitering about the door, I called him, and asked him what he wanted, he begged for a halfpenny. A Mr. Lee came to me, and asked me if I had lost a cheese, as a man had offered one to sale: I went to Mr. Lee's, and saw the prisoner with the cheese under his arm. The cheese is mine, it is marked H, there are eight in a pile on the window; I missed it as soon as Mr. Lee came into the shop. The prisoner begged me to forgive him, I said it was out of my power.
I have kept this cheese from the day it was taken from Mr. Kaye.
My Lord, I have nobody here to speak for me, I have no witnesses.
