I am a house-keeper, No. 19, Chandos-street . On Thursday last, about seven in the evening; there was candles in the shop; I was in the room adjoining the shop; my wife cried out, I am robbed of a shawl; I immediately pursued the prisoner, and took this shawl from under his coat, and have kept it ever since; I did not hear the breaking of the window, but when I came back I found it was broke; it is in the street.
I am the wife of Philip Goads . I was sitting in the shop at work, and a hand burst through the window and tore out the shawl; I immediately screamed out; and my husband ran after him, and brought him back: my husband brought the shawl to me, by order of the justice, and has kept it locked up ever since. (The shawl produced and deposed to.) It hung up for show in the shop: I keep a small milliner's.
As I was going along Chandos-street saw a man running; he passed by, dropped this shawl; I laid hold of it; this gentleman came and took hold of me.
