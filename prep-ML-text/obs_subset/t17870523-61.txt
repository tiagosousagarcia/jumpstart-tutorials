I am wife to Owen Pearce ; my husband was gone upon guard; my house was broke open about nine in the morning, on the 26th of April; there were people below stairs; the house belongs to John Lee , who lives in it; and we have lodgings in it; no person was in my lodging; I locked the door and had the key with me; when I returned, I found the door locked, but missed the things in the indictment; they are worth 2 l. when I returned, I met the prisoner on the two pair of stairs with a bundle in her apron; she asked me for some name, I told her to ask below stairs; I was a stranger in the house; I afterwards found two shirts at Mr. Lane's, a pawnbroker's in Drury-lane; they were my husband's.
I live in the same house with the prisoner; she brought some things to me and said, her husband and she had had some words and desired them to be with me a little; and I gave her leave, and in about an hour afterwards, I heard the officer at the door and I gave them to him; that was the 25th of April.
I tried this key in the door of Mrs. Pearce's, and it both locked and unlocked it; in the prisoner's apartments, I found a parcel of duplicates and a dozen more keys.
A woman asked me to pawn the shirts; I am innocent.
