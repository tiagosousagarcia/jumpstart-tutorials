You are a watchman of the Temple.
Yes.
Were you on the night of Christmas day stationed at the bottom of King's bench walk.
Yes, adjoining the King's bench office. I saw the prisoner go by my box.
Was it light enough for you to know him.
No, in about ten minutes after he went down, I went down to it, I heard a cracking among the slates; it was another watchman that told me that the man was down there getting the lead off. I told him to be carefull when I give him the alarm; I went back to the place, I heard something drop; by the hollowness of the found I thought it was lead, the prisoner at the bar came forward, I asked him what he had got there, he said it was lead, he said he had nothing but what he had brought with him; he was carrying it under his jacket under his arm; I sprung the rattle, and the other watchman came up to my assistance; he took the lead from him, we secured him.
Did you afterwards go and look at the place from whence the lead had been taken.
Yes.
Did you find any had been missing.
Yes, it was evident to be seen.
What time of night was it.
The clock had gone six, before he came down, it was about twenty minutes after six. The constable fitted it to the place.
you are a constable.
Yes. I produce the lead. I went and saw it fitted to the place, it fitted exactly; there is fifteen pound of it; there is two pieces taken from the gutter and one from the ridge, they corresponded exactly.
Then there is no doubt for you to say that that is the lead that was taken from that place.
There is no doubt of it.
I produce the deed.
Is that the deed of trust.
Yes.
Be so good as to say the names of the trustees.
William Lascelles , Esq. Francis Maseres , Esq. James Mingay , Esq. Right Hon. John Lord Redesdale , Joseph Shaw , Esq. William Chayton , Esq. John Eamer , Esq. Right Hon. Nathaniel Bond , Benjamin Way, Richard Richards, Richard Baker , Robert Foster , and Sir Richard Clayton ; these are the surviving trustees. I am the first treasurer.
Did you see that deed executed,
I did.
I believe your hand writing is there.
That is my name.
I was coming from Black-friars road, and going across the end of Water-lane I found this lead coming on as far as the Temple I had occasion to go to the privy, and when I got to the privy I heaved this lead down on the flag stones, and when I got out again I took it up. I was going to Ogle street.
