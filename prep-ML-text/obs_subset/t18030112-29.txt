I was a mason ; on the 26th of last month I was going down Broad-street, St. Giles's , and the prisoner took hold of my arm, and said she wanted to speak to me; another came on the other side of me; the prisoner took my watch out of my pocket, and gave it to the other; I laid hold of the prisoner, and the other run away; I could not hold them both; I secured the prisoner immediately and took her to the watch-house.
This man was standing among a number of girls, and I went to see what was the matter, and he laid hold of me.
There was no other girl but those two.
