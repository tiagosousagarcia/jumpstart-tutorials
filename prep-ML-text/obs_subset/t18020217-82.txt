Where do you live?
In St. Paul's Church-yard: I am in partnership with George Oakley and Thomas Shackleton; the prisoner was clerk to us, and had been so about eight months; we had a customer of the name of Fraser, who was indebted to us 85l. 4s. 6d. in October last.
I live servant with Mr. Fraser: The prisoner applied to me for 85l. 4s. 6d. on account of Oakley, Shackleton, and Evans, in October last; I received a draft from my master on Messrs. Drummonds, which I paid to the prisoner; this is my master's writing.
I am clerk to Messrs. Drummond and Co. and paid this check of 85l. 4s. 6d. but I neither know how I paid it, or to whom.
(To Mr. Evans.) Did the prisoner render any accounts on the 17th of October of the receipts of the day?
Yes, he stated he received of Mr. William Fraser eighty pounds on our account, which I entered in our book, (produces the book, and refers to the entry;) he gave me the sum as all he had received of Mr. Fraser, but never accounted for the other 5l. 4s. 6d. After he was committed at the Mansion-house, he said, if I would stop the prosecution, he and his brother would transport themselves to any part of the world we pleased, which I refused; we paid him forty-five pounds a year, and his board and lodging, but did not allow him any thing else; he entered, in his own hand-writing, \"Received of Mr. Fraser, eighty pounds;\" and, in another book, \"By allowance for ornaments and abatements, 3l. 6s. 6d.\" We never gave leave to make abatements without a note from us.
Has he ever accounted with you for the remainder of the 85l. 4s. 6d?
No, he has not.
Have you ever received the five pounds balance?
Never.
