I went out at seven last Thursday morning; I left nobody at home; I fastened my own apartment; it is Mr. Lowe's house; he lets off two rooms; I was informed I was robbed.
I took the prisoner with a bundle of things; I first saw her at the bottom of my stairs; she said, the things were her's.
I helped to apprehend the prisoner.
I am the constable; I said to the prisoner, old acquaintance, where are your keys? and there were fourteen keys found on the ground, and one in her pocket.
I found the things.
