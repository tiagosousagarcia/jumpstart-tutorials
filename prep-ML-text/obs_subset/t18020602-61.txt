I am servant to Mr. Samuel Ridge , at Bonner's-hall : On Monday the 24th of May, we lost a shovel and a dung-fork from the shed, in the cow-yard; the prisoner was a labourer, and worked for Mr. Ridge, he disappeared that evening; I saw him on the Friday, at Lambeth-street, with the property.
I am a labourer; last Friday was a week, I saw the constable with a fork and a shovel, in Rosemary-lane, and knowing them to be my master's tools, I stopped him and told him I knew who they belonged to, and the next day I saw the prisoner at Lambeth-street.
I am a constable, (produces the shovel and dung fork;) this day fortnight, the 24th of May, about a quarter before eleven, my son was shutting up shop, I keep a butcher's shop, in Rosemary-lane; the prisoner wanted to find a broker, I said, it is a very odd time of night to look for a broker, what have you got to sell, he said, this shovel and fork; I asked him how he came by it, and what trade he was; he said, he was a bricklayer's labourer; I said, they were not labourer's tools; I thought they belonged to some cow-yard; he said, he had bought them of Mr. Macmanus, and he would produce the man; I suspected he had stolen them, and I took him to the watch-house; on the Friday following, I had them in my hand, and the last witness came up and claimed them.
