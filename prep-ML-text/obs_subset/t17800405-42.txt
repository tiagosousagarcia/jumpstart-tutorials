On the 24th of February, about five in the evening, the prisoner came into my mistress's, who keeps a publick-house; he called for a glass of liquor at the bar, and asked leave of my mistress to go backwards; he went backwards, and came back and looked into the kitchen and saw me there; he went away. He came again at seven and had a glass of liquor at the bar, and asked to go backwards again; my mistress said he would not find the way backwards; he said he had been before. I was in the kitchen at work; my mistress called me; he came from the necessary, and went into the kitchen and took a gown of mine, it was hanging in the kitchen. My mistress saw him come out of the kitchen.
I saw the prisoner coming across the kitchen, which gave me a suspicion; we stopped him in the passage, and found the gown concealed under his coat.
I was starving; I took it for want. I could get no business to do.
