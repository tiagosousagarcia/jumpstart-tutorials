- I am an officer: I was sent for to Messrs. Williams's, in the Poultry , on the 18th of November, about ten o'clock, the prisoner was in the warehouse, Mr. Williams gave him in charge to me; the rest of the servants' boxes were searched, and finding his box was in the house I went to him at the Compter for the key, and he denied having it; I told him if he did not let me have it his box would be broke open; he then gave me two keys tied together, from his waistcoat-pocket, Mr. Williams went with me; I opened his box, and found this piece of printed calico, (produces it) Mr. Williams claimed it as his property. He said before the Lord Mayor -
What he said before the Lord Mayor was taken in writing?
I believe not that part.
You are clerk to the Lord Mayor?
Yes.
Was what the prisoner said reduced into writing?
It was not.
He said before the Lord Mayor he was guilty; that he had been a good servant to them, and was very sorry.
- (Proves the the firm.) The prisoner had been our porter between three and four years; in consequence of suspicion, I sent for Fenner, and this property was found in his box, I know it to be our property; he always behaved well till this time.
