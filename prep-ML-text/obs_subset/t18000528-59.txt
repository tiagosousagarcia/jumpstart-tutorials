I am a shoemaker : On the 26th of April I was serving in my shop, between six and seven in the evening, and in consequence of information that somebody had been into our yard, I pursued the prisoner; I called stop thief; he ran down Denmark-court, and a soldier stopped him, and he threw away the waistcoat; when I came up he said he hoped I would forgive him, he had done a bad thing; he was taken to the watch-house and searched, there was a waistcoat of my son's, about fourteen years of age, and a shawl I found upon him my wife.
You provide your son with clothes?
Yes.
The prisoner was brought to the watch-house, and I found the waistcoat and the shawl between his shirt and his skin, quite wet; I asked him how he came by them, and he said he found them.
These are my property.
I was very much distrest, and my shopmates had given me some beer; I had very little, and it affected my head; I do not know what I was in the watch-house for; it is the first crime I ever committed; how I came by the things I do not know; I throw myself at your Lordship's feet for mercy; I have a wife and children.
He was half drunk.
