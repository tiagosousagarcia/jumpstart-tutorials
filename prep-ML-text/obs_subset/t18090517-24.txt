I am a cheesmonger ; I live in Fore-street . On Saturday, the 22nd of April, about twelve o'clock at noon; this woman stood at the door, she did not seem to want any thing; she came into the shop and asked the price of eggs, how many for a shilling; I told her twelve; I looked after her, I missed a piece of bacon; I turned the corner of her cloak of one side there I saw the bacon; she said she only took it to look at it; she wanted a pound of it; she told me she would give me half a guinea if I would let her go.
I am an officer. I found on the prisoner two more pieces of bacon and about an hundred duplicates.
I bought these two pieces of bacon at the corner of Grub-street; I had the bacon with me, a woman asked me what I gave a pound for it; I told her ten-pence; the woman said they asked eleven-pence for this; I took it in my hand, I did not go from the door with it.
