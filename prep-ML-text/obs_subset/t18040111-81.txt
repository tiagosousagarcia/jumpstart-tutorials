I am servant to Mr. Jamieson: On Tuesday, between one and two o'clock, Naylor came to our house, and said he came from Mr. Dunbar for the remainder of the bottles; he had away five dozen; I am sure he is the person; he came three days following.
Mr. Dunbar was to send to me for some empty bottles; there were forty or fifty dozen altogether.
I live at No. 7, Fore-street, Limehouse; I had agreed with Mr. Jamieson for some empty bottles; I sent my servant for them; the prisoner is not my servant; I never ordered him to fetch them; I never saw him till I saw him at Guildhall.
I leave myself to the mercy of the Court.
