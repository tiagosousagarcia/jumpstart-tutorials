I am the sister of John Gomersall ; the prisoner is my mother-in-law, she does not live with my father, they are parted; I live with my father and my brother. On Friday morning I missed the shirt, I went to her and asked her for it, she said she had pawned it; she told me to take the things out and stop it out of her money. On Saturday morning I looked for my brother's flannel waistcoat, I could not find them; I looked for his best breeches, I could not find them. The prisoner was with us all day on Christmas day; she came on purpose to have the child baptized, and on the next day she packed up all her things, and these things along with them.
Why does not your mother live with your father
She has stripped four furnished lodgings.
I produce a waistcoat pawned for nine pence; I cannot swear to the person of the prisoner, but she confirmed it by her own confession.
The prisoner pawned a pair of breeches with me on the 27th of December for one shilling.
I produce a shirt pawned for two shillings on the 27th of December by the prisoner
. Might not your mother take these things in a mistake
I do not think she did.
I am away from my husband, his son and daughter; I have not been used very well by them, they did not use my child very well; the prosecutor advised me to come and have the child baptized on Christmas day; I was short of money; I asked my husband for money, he would not give me any; I thought I might make free with these things, I took them; I said Mary, take them out on Saturday night, that is three shillings and nine pence, and bring me one shilling and three halfpence; I told her to take the three shillings and ninepence out of my money; I bought herrings and potatoes with the money. I hope you will pardon me this time for my baby's sake; I thought it was no harm.
