I am an hair-dresser ; on Monday morning, about half past two, I had my pocket picked of a handkerchief as I was upon duty; I was constable of the night, on the top of Bread-street, Cheapside ; I was going my rounds, I felt my handkerchief going out of my pocket, and I then turned round and saw the prisoner (I had a common coat on) put the handkerchief into his bosom; I took him into custody, and took the handkerchief from him; I carried him to the New Compter, and in the morning I took him before the Alderman.
The prosecutor said I had taken his handkerchief; I said I had not, he then said whether you have or no, I will swear you have.
