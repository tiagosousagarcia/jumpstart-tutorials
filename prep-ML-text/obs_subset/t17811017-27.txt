I am a waterman . On Saturday, the 6th of this month, I went home in the evening. I found my box open, and missed all the things mentioned in the indictment. I went and took the prisoner, at the Black-boy, on Saltpetre-bank. He was asleep, and my father's neck-cloth lay under his head. He took it and put it in his pocket. I asked him to go home with me. Then I took him into the house of a publican where Mr. Carney the constable was.
The prosecutor and prisoner came into a house where I was, and called for something to drink. Then the prosecutor called me aside, and desired me to take charge of the prisoner. I found the neck-cloth upon him.
The prisoner lodged in the same house with me. There were some other sailors in the house.
He wanted me and three more to go on board an Indiaman. I would not go. He took the other three men on board the Indiaman, and because I would not go, he charged me with stealing these things. I was coming out of the house with a comrade, and picked up a bit of cloth. I said to him, that would do to put about my leg, and put it in my pocket. For two days nobody owned it. When he took me, I told him I found it. I believe he has sent the man out of the way that was with me, that he might not appear.
