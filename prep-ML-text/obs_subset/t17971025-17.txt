My father keeps a carpet and upholstery warehouse ; I was in the accompting-house on Saturday the 14th of October, about five o'clock in the afternoon; I saw the prisoner run out with a quilt and a blanket from the shop window; I went to the door, he ran up Holborn, and I followed him into Redlion-square, where I saw him within the rails, and the property upon him, I brought him back.
A man offered me a shilling to carry them to Gower-street, Bedford-square.
