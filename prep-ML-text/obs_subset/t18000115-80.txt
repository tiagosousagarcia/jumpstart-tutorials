On the 7th of December last, I was coming out of the White Bear, in Bride-lane , between twelve and one o'clock at night, I was rather the worse for liquor; I met with the prisoner as I was coming out at the door, and she asked me if I would give her any thing to drink; I immediately replied, that I could not give her any thing to drink, for I had not any money; she put her hand down to my breeches, and said, she was sure I had got some money; I put my hand down directly, and missed my watch chain; I had looked at my watch not ten minutes before, in the public-house, it was then half past twelve o'clock; then I felt in my fob for the watch, and found it was gone; I charged her with it, and she denied it; I called the watchman, and gave charge of her, the constable has got the watch; when the watchman came up, I saw something lying glittering on the ground, on the left-hand side of the prisoner; I stooped down, and it was my watch chain and seal, it was a silver seal with J T upon it; I desired the watchman then to search her pocket, to see if she had got my watch or not; we searched her pocket, but could find no watch there; one of the watchmen clapped his hand down her bosom and found the watch there; it is a silver watch, I know it by the maker's name, and number.
I am a constable, (produces the watch) the watchman gave it into my custody.
Taylor gave me charge of the woman, and I found the watch down her bosom.
I met with the prosecutor, he wanted me to take him home with me, but he said he had got no money; he then told me to go up that dark passage, and he gave me the watch till the morning; and after I had obliged him he wanted the watch back, and laid hold of the chain to pull it forcibly from me, and that was the way the chain broke.
Did she deny having the watch before you searched her?
Yes, she did.
