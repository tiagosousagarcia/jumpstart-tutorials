I bought this horse, and my brother has a joint property in it, to sell a few things about, being lame, and selling greens, and roots, and old rags; my arm was so bad I could not work; and I turned my horse, (by leave) into Mr. Rhodes's field; the prisoner made bricks there; I went to see for him, and going down Cow Cross, I heard of a horse, and I went and found it was my horse; there are a great many vacancies for a horse to get out of the field.
I am licensed for slaughtering; I am a widow; on Tuesday night of the 5th of September, the horse was brought by the prisoner; to the best of my knowledge he is the lad; if I said he was not I should perjure myself; I am positive sure it was him; I detained the horse and boy; I thought he did not come honestly by it; it was a bay horse, and blind, his knees were broke, and lame withal.
I have nothing to say.
Gentlemen, in such a case, to see such a boy brought into such a situation, for such a horse, must give pain to your minds as well as to ours; but my brother Gould, whose humanity is as large as his knowledge, has suggested to me, that there have been cases in which a jury have fixed the value of the horse at 10 d. now, if ever there was a case of that kind, this is that very case, therefore, if you think fit to find him guilty value 10 d it will of course save him from the punishment attendant on the crime of horsestealing.
