I am a cooper , in partnership with Benjamin Shaw : On Monday, the 18th of October, between three and four o'clock, we lost a cask; I did not see the transaction; I was called, and found the cask in possession of the constable; I knew it to be mine by the mark; I had seen it on the Saturday, in a yard of ours, in Distaff-lane .
I am servant to Messrs. Shaw and Church; I saw the prisoner coming out of the yard; he was rolling the hogshead out; he came out, and was putting the pin in to fasten the gate; he rolled it 10 or 12 yards from the gate, and I asked him where he was going with that; he said, he had a comrade who was gone on before; I said, it is my masters' property, and you shall not take it any farther; I took the prisoner to my masters' house,and left the hogshead in the street.
I am a constable; I took charge of the prisoner, and delivered the hogshead to Mr. Church.
I was going down Distaff-lane, there were several hogsheads on one side of the way, and a waggon unloading on the other, and it is possible my coat might have touched the hogshead, but my hand was never upon it.
