- I am the wife of John Davy ; the prisoner came to lodge at my house the 4th of August, in St. Giles's parish; she had the things for her use; I lost a tea-kettle and a pail; she borrowed the flat iron and the pail as she wanted them; the tea-kettle was the only thing that I lost, that was let with the lodgings; she told me she would pay me for the flat iron, but she would not own to the tea-kettle and pail; when she left the lodgings, I missed the flat iron first, and she gave me the duplicate of that.
Are you sure you never had these things at all from her, after you lent them?
No, I never had.
- I am a pawnbroker; I have known the prisoner for a considerable time; she pledged a flat iron with me the 21st of July last, (produces it) ; she pledged it in the name of Mary Elliot.
What is the value of it?
It is worth about ten pence.
To the best of my knowledge it's mine.
She desired me to pledge it for sixpence; she had not got sixpence in the world; the other things I never had.
I never desired her to pledge any thing for me.
