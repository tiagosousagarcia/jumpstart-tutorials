I can only prove the property.
I chair for Mr. Cismore, No. 10, John-street, Bedford-row , he keeps a private house: I had left the hall-door for a moment yesterday morning, between eight and nine o'clock, I heard a man's foot; I saw the prisoner with the tea-caddy in his hand, it was on the table in the parlour; he ran out of the house with it, I went after him, he threw it down, I picked it up, and he ran away; he was pursued and taken immediately; I am sure he is the same man.
I was coming down King's-road: I saw the prisoner running I stopped him; several persons came up, and I left him with them while I went to John-street; when I came back again to them, he had made his escape by means of a knife being drawn; I pursued him to Lambs-Conduit-street, and took him again; I am sure he is the same person; I did not see the knife.
I never was in the street at all; I was in Red-lion-passage when I was stopped.
