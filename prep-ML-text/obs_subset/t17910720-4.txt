I am a butcher at Brewer-street, No. 27. The 23d of May, I lost the things in the indictment, from No. 3, in Middlesex-court , where I lodge; it was the first night of my lodging; the prisoner slept with me; he came to bed about eleven; the things were all safe over night; I counted my money, and put my breeches under my head; in the morning, at seven, I awaked, and they were gone; I am sure it is the same man.
I took the prisoner four or five weeks ago; I found a knee-buckle upon him; I took him in St. Martin's-lane, at Mr. Collet's; he was undoing his knee of his breeches, and was taking out the knee-buckle; he clasped it in his hand; no more of the property has been found.
The prisoner lodged with me; I said I did not choose to take him without a character; he said that his lodgings were over Black-friar's-bridge; he gave me six-pence earnest. On Monday night I told him there was a young man slept with him, and he said he was glad of it; and he went out early in, the morning, and never came to lodge again.
Look at that knee-buckle; do you know it?
The knee-buckle I lost was very much like that; it had no particular mark on it.
When I came to bed about eleven at night (this young man went to bed about nine, or a quarter after) this gentlewoman says to me, you have got a bed-fellow with you; the door was wide open, and I saw no property at all, nor the next morning; and I went to work; there were other lodgers in the house; they might go out at any time of the night they thought proper.
Mine were all honest lodgers.
