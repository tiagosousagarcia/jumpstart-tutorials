I am a shoe-maker in Fore-street ; I was not at home at the time I lost my property; when I came home, I found the prisoner in the shop.
I am a plaisterer: I was going past Mr. Heapy's shop, and saw the prisoner and another lad; I heard the prisoner say, now you can go in; having a suspicion, I crossed the way, and watched them; the shop-door was open, and the shoes were lying, tied up in a bundle, against the shop-door; I saw him put them under his arm, and walk away with them; I went after him, and took him in Ironmonger-lane, with the shoes upon him; I brought him back, and sent for a constable.
