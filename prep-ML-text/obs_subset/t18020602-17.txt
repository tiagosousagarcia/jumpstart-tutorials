I am a labouring man : On the 14th of May, I was coming up Oxford-road, with a cart-load of hay; and the prisoner asked me, if I would let him help me to load a load of dung; I told him I would; I knew nothing of him before; he said he had had no victuals, or any thing, all day; he helped me to load my cart; I then told him, if he would go with me to Paddington, to the place where I water, I had some victuals, and would give him some; he went with me, and I gave him some victuals, a glass of gin, and part of a pot of beer; he said that satisfied him; I went over to No. 26; and, while I was gone, he took the horses on, about a furlong, and then took my great coat, whip, and shovel, out of the cart; I saw him run away from the cart with them: A gentleman, riding up, desired his footman to go after him; but he hid himself, and we could not find him; I saw him the next day, with the property, at Marlborough-street.
I am a carter, and live at West-End: On Tuesday, the 14th of May, I was at the Red Lion, at Kilburn; we heard of these things being stolen; and, in consequence of information, we went to the Buffalo's Head, in the New Road, where we found the prisoner and the property; the ostler knew the great coat, and said, that is Bent's coat; we took him to the watch-house, and the next day he was taken to Marlborough-street.
He asked me to drive his team on, which I did, and the things sell off the cart into the high road.
