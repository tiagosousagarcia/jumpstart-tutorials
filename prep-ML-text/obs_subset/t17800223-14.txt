The trunk with the things mentioned in the indictment, was in the boot of the Camberwell coach . My wife and two sons were in the coach. It was delivered to the coachman by my wife.
Was you present when it was delivered?
No, the coachman brought the prisoner in to me; when the trunk was taken upon him. I could swear to the trunk and the things in it.
I am coachman of the Camberwell stage. I was coming up with the coach, on Friday night the 14th of January; I stopped at the bottom of Fish-street-hill to deliver a parcel; as I returned from delivering the parcel, I saw a man looking in at the boot of the coach; I bid him take care; he reeled away as if he was drunk. I stopped again at Fenchurch-street for a lady and child to get out of the coach; as they were getting out, I saw the same man standing again by my elbow. As I put up my arm for the gentlewoman to lay hold of it to get out, I perceived the slap of the boot go up. As soon as the lady let go my arm, I went to the side of the boot and saw the prisoner, he had got the trunk from the bottom of the boot to the top of it. The prisoner was not the person I had observed before.
Did you know the prisoner before?
Not before that night.
Are you sure it was Levi Solomon ?
Yes. He had hold of the box and got it from the bottom to the top of the boot; I cried out stop thief! he immediately let it fall, it fell edgeways in the boot.
Had he got it out of the boot?
No.
Did he meddle with it again?
No. I ran round the horses after him.
He was taken up afterwards?
Yes. I lost a box that cost me 20 l. before. I received this box from Mrs. Irwin.
