I am a publican , I keep the Nag's-head, the corner of Whitecross-street . The prisoner and two others came to my house on the 5th of May, about half past seven in the evening; they had two pennyworth of rum each, and asked for change of a pound note, which I gave them - a half guinea, a seven shilling piece, and two shillings in silver; the rum was paid for; they gave me a good note. After the other man had got his change, the prisoner wished to pay for the liquor himself; the other man then desired me to return him his note, and he gave me the change back again; he consented then for the prisoner to pay for the liquor; he then asked the prisoner why he did not pay for the liquor; the prisoner felt some time in his pocket, and said he wanted change for half a guinea; he gave me no half guinea; the other said I might as well change my note as you change your half guinea; he then desired me to give him the change again and take the note; I put him down the change I received of him; he then threw me down a note, very closely folded up, and they all three of them went out of the house as fast as they could go with the money.
Which money you let them have willingly
I put it down, and they left a fictitious note.
