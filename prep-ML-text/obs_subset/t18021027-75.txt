I live at No. 12. Great Swan-alley, Coleman-street , and am a journeyman tailor ; I hired the prisoner as a weekly servant , and she had lived with me about five months; she took my cloaths and my children's, and pawned them without my knowledge or order; I taxed her with it, and she seemed to deny it; I said I must have the things, and sent for the constable, who searched her, and found some duplicates on her.
I am an officer; on the 28th of September I took the prisoner into custody; she had a housewife in her hand, and a great many duplicates; I said I would search her; upon which she threw them all into the grate, though there was no fire.(The pawnbroker produced a sheet, a coat, waistcoat, flat-iron, two pillow-cases, child's frock, and two petticats, which were identified by the prosecutor.)
I know the prisoner very well, but cannot say whether she pledged them; the duplicates are all in the prisoner's name.
He sent me frequently to pawn things for him.
Is that true?
No.
She said she had pawned them, and was willing to get them again.
