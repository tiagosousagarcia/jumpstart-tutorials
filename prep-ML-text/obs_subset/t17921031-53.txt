I live at No. 3, Rodney's-row, Farmer-street, Shadwell ; on the 25th of September, between nine and ten, I left my own home; when I came home, and coming up the row, I saw a man run out of the passage, that was Thomas Poore ; I left the door padlocked, it is a ground floor; I went in and found the hasp was gone, and the door was broke open; I pursued up the alley, and called stop thief! when I gave the alarm, he dropped the sheet; there was a man took hold of him and brought him back to the top of Farmer-street, and the officer took him to the watch-house; the staple was drawn and a piece broke off the door; (looks towards the bar) that is the man; the sheet was dropped about one hundred yards from where I live, I am a single woman and have two rooms; I am very sure my door was fastened, I shewed the door to Phillips and the constable.
It is very hard for a man to have his life sworn away, she is a common prostitute on the town.
I am a biscuit baker, I live at No. 2, Lower Gun-alley; about a quarter before ten, on the 25th of September, I was going along Shadwell High-street, I heard the cry of stop thief! the prisoner was running as hard as he could and I stopped him, and Abberley assisted me to take him back into Farmer-street; the woman said that is the man; we then went to the house, and the staple was gone, and a piece of the wainscot torn away.
On the 25th of September, I was going along Shadwell, and this girl charged the prisoner with breaking open her room; I examined the room and found it had been broke open, as before described.
I know no more of it than the child just born into the world.
