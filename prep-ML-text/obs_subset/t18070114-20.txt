I live with Mr. Phoene, upholsterer. On the 30th of December I was coming from a benefit club held in Artillery lane, at about half past twelve in the night. I met the prisoner and a woman; we went to the castle in Long alley, there we had a glass of gin a-piece.
Had you been drinking a good deal at the club.
I was a little in liquor; we were coming down Long alley together, the woman parted from us, and the man said he would see me part of the way home; and just as we came to Ball alley , he snatched my hat, turned back, and ran away with it.
Did you know the man.
No, nor the woman.
Did you ever see your hat again.
Not till the watchman brought it up to the watchhouse. In about half an hour afterwards he was brought to the watchhouse hat and all.
When you was at the Castle do you recollect pulling any money out of your pocket and throwing it about.
I dropped a seven shilling piece; the prisoner picked it up and gave it me.
On the 30th of December, between the hours of twelve and one at night, the prisoner and the prosecutor passed me arm and arm, and a young woman was with them. I was on my duty then, and within five minutes the prisoner ran back and passed me again; the prosecutor cried out, stop him, he has robbed me of my hat. I found where the prisoner lodged, and the constable and I went and took him; we found the hat in a lumber room in the same house where the prisoner was.
I never saw the hat.
