I am a victualler; I keep the sign of the Active and Hermione, the corner of Compton-street .
I go to work; I was coming down stairs; I met this man going up stairs, at Mr. Willcox's, in Grafton-street; I asked him who he wanted; he put the pot down; I shut the door; I lodge in that house; I called Mrs. Willcox; then she sent for a publican; he came; this pot, that he dropped, the man at the Falcon picked up; I have had it ever since.
I produce a pint pot; I was at Bramwell's; he and I went over together; I took the prisoner, and searched him, and found this pint pot upon him.
My house is not a quarter of a mile from Grafton-street; I live at the corner of Prince's-street: I have lost a vast number of pots.
