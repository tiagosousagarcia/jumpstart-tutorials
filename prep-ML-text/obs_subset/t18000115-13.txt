On Friday, I think, the 20th of December, between four and five in the evening, I was upon the watch, in Newgate-street , and saw the prisoner take a cask out from twelve that lay one upon another, and put it upon his shoulder; they were standing against the side of Newgate; the dray was going further, and they pitched the casks there till they came back; I followed him as far as St. Bartholomew's hospital, and there he pitched it; I then caught hold of him, and asked him what he was going to do with that cask; he told me a gentleman had hired him to carry it into Jewin-street, for which he had given him a shilling; I told him to take it into Jewin-street, and I would go with him, he refused; I know this cask to be mine, it is here.
I have been in the hospital five months; I was going to Snow-hill, and a man offered to give me a shilling to carry it to Jewin-street, and when I got into St. Bartholomew's-hospital, I was stopped with it; I had not had a bit of bread in my lips from the Wednesday till I was taken to the Compter on the Friday, and then only a three-penny loaf for myself, my wife, and three small children.
