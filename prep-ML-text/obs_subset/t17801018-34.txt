I am a journeyman carpenter and joiner . On last Wednesday night I went into a publick house in St. Giles's, and drank beer with some of my fellow workmen; I fell asleep in the tap-room.
Did you drink a good deal?
I was not insensible , I drank but little liquor; my landlord waked me; he said it was half after twelve o'clock, and bid me go home to my lodging. As I came out, the prisoner laid hold of me, and asked me to go home with her, for she said I should be locked out of my lodgings. I went home with her, and went to bed with her; I put my watch in my stocking; I did not take my stocking off; I waked about three o'clock, and found my watch and the prisoner gone; I took the woman of the house to the watch-house, but she was discharged; I took the prisoner up afterwards, but never found my watch.
