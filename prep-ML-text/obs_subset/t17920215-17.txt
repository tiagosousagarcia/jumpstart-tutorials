On Tuesday, the 24th of January, at eight o'clock in the evening, the prisoner and the sugar were brought to me.
I am a plumber: coming from work, about eight, I saw the prisoner and two boys standing at M'Lellan's door; I suspected them, and saw the prisoner go in and take this loaf of sugar off the counter; he put it under his coat, and his hand over it; I followed him and took it from him, and he knocked me down and stamped on my breast; I cried out for assistance, which came; I carried the sugar and prisoner to M'Lellan's house; he would not believe, at that time, that he had lost any.
I missed the sugar; there is 14 lb. and a cross on the bottom.
I have nothing to say for myself.
