I am a waterman : Last Tuesday week, about eight in the morning, I had been in liquor, and found myself in Whitcomb-street, I do not know how I came there; I remember coming from Greenwich in a coach, and got down to go to my own home, at Hungerford, when I met with this woman at the bar.
You have had a drop to day to, have not you?
I have had a glass.
Gentlemen, it is impossible to go on with this trial; you see the situation of this man, you must acquit the prisoner.
