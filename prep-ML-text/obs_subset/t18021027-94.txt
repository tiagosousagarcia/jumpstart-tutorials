I am daughter-in-law to Mr. Wilson, who keeps the Plough, at Homerton : On the 5th of October the prisoner came and asked for a lodging, which he had; he got up about seven in the morning, and when he was gone, I heard from the servant that the things were gone; I saw him run; I followed him; he got over a bank into a field, and I followed him; he was putting the things up in a bundle, when I collared him; I told him he had stole my sheet; he begged I would let him go, and he would give me all he had taken; he then took the sheet from under his smock-frock; I then perceived the blanket in the bundle; a young man came to my assistance, and he was secured; when I went home, I found the things were gone. - The property was produced, and identified by the witness.)
That is not the same blanket that I had, and she sheet I know nothing about.
