I live at Mile End ; I lost four ducks and two geese.
I am a labouring man; I saw the prisoner take the ducks and geese, there were two of them; I was put to watch them; they were in an orchard, about an acre and a half; I saw the prisoner take the ducks and geese and put them into this bag; there were two of them, one got away, the other I took to the watch-house; he saw me coming, and laid down upon the bag.
When he took me he said he would make a guinea of me.
The morning after he offered me a guinea not to appear against him.
I told my ducks and geese the night before; when I got up in the morning I told them again, and missed four ducks and two geese.
I shewed the geese to my master.
My mother lives at Bow; I was coming along and saw two men, and they began to use me ill, and kicked my hat over the pales and I got over after it.
