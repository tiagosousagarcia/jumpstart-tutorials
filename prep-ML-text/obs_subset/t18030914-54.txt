- I am a widow , I live in Charles-street, Long-acre ; On the 4th of August, I lost the articles; I saw the prisoner go out of the room, I was not very well, and had laid down; the prisoner brought some work to me, and worked two days with me for company, and when she was packing up my things, I thought she was taking her work; the bundle she took out was bigger than that she brought in, and I had a suspicion; I called my landlord down; I had information where the prisoner was on the Friday, and I went and took her, she had on my cloak, aprons and handkerchief, she would not give any account of the other things; I gave charge of her, and the officer took the things from her which I produce (produces and identifies them;) the gown, petticoat and apron, she will not tell where they are.
I am a shoe-maker, Mrs. Stevens lodges with me; on the 4th of August, between eight and nine o'clock, I was with her, when she missed the articles, and on the 6th, I saw the cloak, handkerchief, and apron taken from the prisoner.
Mrs. Stevens and I lived in the same house, she goes out at night, she was intoxicated, and had pledged my apron; I said, never mind, she lent me a handkerchief and apron; she had a man with her, and I acknowledge I put on her cloak to take home a pair of gaiters, and was going home with them when I met her.
