I am gardener to Mr. Salt: I kept a gun in the Summer-house in the garden, I had not seen it for above a month before: On the 30th of December I missed it; and upon missing it, in consequence of information I received, I went to Tyler and Laycock's, in Shoreditch; I went there and found it was Mr. Salt's gun, and I then had the prisoner apprehended, (the gun produced); I know it to be my master's gun; I have had it in my possession a twelvemonth, I am sure it is the very same gun, there is the head of a screw broke off; I saw it again on the 30th of December; I delivered it to the Justice, and he delivered it to the constable; the duplicate is dated 18th of November; the prisoner worked with me about that time, but I am not certain to a day.
The prisoner pawned this gun in my name unknown to me, I heard it from my father's man; I went to the pawnbroker's with the last witness, and found the gun; I had the duplicate from Mr. Amery, who keeps the Red-lion at Tottenham; I gave the duplicate to the gardener.
On the 18th of November, my servant picked up a duplicate in the taproom; it was offered to the prisoner, who had been in the tap-room, but he would not accept it; I afterwards gave it to Mr. Dyson.
I am a pawnbroker, servant to Mr. Tyler, in Shorditch; On the 18th of November, this gun was pawned at our house by the prisoner; I am sure it was the prisoner (produces the duplicate) I received it from Kinghorn; I lent him thirty shillings upon the gun, in the name of John Chalkley, Ware, for Dyson.
I worked for Mr. Kinghorn; I was clearing the leaves out of the garden, and found this gun underneath the leaves; I kept it eight or nine days, and nobody said any thing about it, and I pawned it; Mr. Dyson knows me very well.
I know nothing to his credit.
