I am an American sailor ; I lost the articles mentioned in the indictment from on board the ship on Friday last; the prisoner came with us from America, as a sailor ; we came last from Petersburgh; I lost them out of my chest while I was asleep; the Police officers came on board with the prisoner on Friday night, between eleven and twelve o'clock, and inquired if I had lost these things.
On Friday night last, between eleven and twelve o'clock, I derected the prisoner at Wapping-stairs, with a large bundle; I did not see him land, he was at the stair-head; I asked him where he was going with that bundle; he told me he was going to his washer-woman's; I asked him where she lived, and he could not tell me; I asked him what ship he belonged to; he told me the Suffolk; I had another officer with me, and we took him on board the Suffolk; after overhauling the bundle, Stewart claimed the property.
I took them by mistake.
