I live with John Fieldsend. On Tues day the 28th of January, I observed a man with some printed cottons on his shoulder, (I was in Oxford-street , near Mr. Fieldsend's house,) which I supposed to be Mr. Fieldsend's, when I went in I asked Mr. Fieldsend if he had lent his goods to a neighbour?
You did not see the man come out of the shop?
No. Mr. Fieldsend answered me in the negative; from that I pursued the prisoner into Dean-street; I see him go down Dean-street, when he looked back, and, I suppose, seeing me pursuing him he let the goods fall and ran away; when I called stop thief, several people pursued him, amongst the rest a soldier of the name of Nicholls, who will appear; he was taken in Soho-square; I stopped with the goods till a person of the name of Foster, who lives with Mr. Fieldsend, came and took him. The prisoner had turned the corner of Carlisle-street.
Can you say that the prisoner was the man that had the things on his back?
I cannot positively say that; I followed him when Mr. Foster had the care of the gods, and came up with him in Soho-square; when I came up with him he was taken to Bow-street.
Why did you take him up if he was not the man that had the goods?
It was not me that stopped him, he was stopped by other people.
There was an alarm in the shop of a man taking away some printed cotton; they were not laying in the shop, they were out at the door; I am in the shop of Mr. Fieldsend. I went to the door, and the people told me that the man was gone down Dean-street, and I pursued, and I saw the printed cottons thrown down on the ground, and our man standing by them, the other man had gone first. I know nothing, only that these are the very goods.
