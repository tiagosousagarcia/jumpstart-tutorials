I am the wife of John Purton ; he is a brass founder . On the 15th of November, between eleven and twelve at noon, I lost my pail from the two pair of stairs passage against the door; a neighbour opposite saw her bring it down stairs and empty the water out of it; I immediately ran after her and took it away from her.
Did she live in the house
No; I never saw her before.
I live opposite Mrs. Purton; I saw the prisoner bring down the pail, I thought she did not get it honestly; I went to Mrs. Purton; she ran after her and took it from her.
I was in confinement five weeks; that is my pail; I went out for a pail of water; I bought that pail.
