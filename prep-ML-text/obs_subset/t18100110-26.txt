I am son to William Cummins , his partner's name is Joseph Cummins ; they live at 72, Cheapside . On the 9th instant, the prisoner came into the shop, she asked to look at some silk handkerchiefs; she looked at several, and at last, said, she would take one, and agreed to pay seven shillings and sixpence for it, a person came into the shop, and drew my eyes off her, and when I turned my eyes to her, I observed her countenance change; I saw her shuffling in her pocket, or under her gown, which excited my suspicion: I went to my father, and told him that we had a thief, we both advanced to her, I said, I had strong suspicion that she had some property about her, that did not belong to her, she replied, God forbid; you may search me. I saw four handkerchiefs suspending at the bottom of her coats: my father drew the handkerchiefs down, and said, how wrong she had acted; she said, have mercy on me, and pray forgive me; and while we sent for an officer, she pulled out a box, containing several bank notes, she offered them all to me to liberate her, for she had six children. I told her, an officer was sent for, and she must take the consequence.
I am innocent of the charge alledged against me; I have six children.
