I am the wife of John Such, No. 10, Aldgate : on the 31st of December, the prisoner came into our shop about nine o'clock; she brought in a young woman with her; and my boy was in the shop, and he served the other woman with a pair of shoes; I went into the shop, and she said, Ma'am, I like nobody's shoes as well as your's; fit me with a pair of dog-skin shoes; I did; and while I was gone back again to the shelves, she got up from her chair; I goes back again, to see if I had any more that fit her, and she made answer to me, perhaps you may have some next week, and I will call again; and said, Ma'am, I wish you would try on that lady's shoes, for she was sure I should fit her; I said, good woman, you have something you ought not to have; she said, I have, but I don't mean to take it away; she then gave me four pair of children's shoes in a paper, from under her cloak; she had asked for no children's shoes at that time, she had a week before: afterwards I saw her take two pair of women's leather shoes out of her pocket, and put them on a shelf; they were put up in paper to be carried home that evening; she took them from the part she put them to; she did not offer to produce them at the time I told her of the children's shoes.
I am servant to Mr. Such.
I beg for mercy, my Lord, and of every gentleman that is here; for I am really innocent.
