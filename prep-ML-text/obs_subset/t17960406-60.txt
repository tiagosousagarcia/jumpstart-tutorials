I live at Surgeon's Hall ; upon the 20th of February I left my great coat in a chaise at the stables where I put up; I missed it in the evening; and on the Friday morning following I received a letter from the Magistrate at Worship-street, desiring me to attend there on the Wednesday; that a man was taken up on suspicion; I had my name written on a piece of paper on the back of it; I went on the Wednesday, and saw the man and the coat; I am sure it was my coat.
I am a pawnbroker; the prisoner at the bar offered me the coat to pledge; I asked him several questions; I thought he had not come honestly by the coat, and I sent for an officer; he told me he bought it of a Jew at Woolwich, on the 20th of February, about seven o'clock in the evening; when the officer came, he told me he had picked it up in Union-street, (produces the coat)
This is my coat, it has my name in it.
I am not guilty; I picked it up coming out of the gate at dinner time; I did not think any think of it.
