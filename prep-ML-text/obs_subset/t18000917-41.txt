I live in Fleet-market : On the 18th of August, about half past five in the evening, the prisoner came into my shop and asked if I had a pair of shoes to fit her; I shewed her two or three pair, and she said there was nothing to suit her, and she went about her business; I missed two odd shoes in about two minutes after she was gone; she came back again in about half an hour, to look at a pair of shoes that she had seen before.
Were they women's shoes?
Yes; she then took a pair and two odd ones, and under pre tence of trying them on, put them between her shift and petticoat; I saw her do it; she only tried one on; she pulled it off again, and left it upon the floor; she said they would not suit her, and was going away again; I stopped her and shook her petticoat, and the three shoes sell from under her petticoat.
We understood you to say she came to your shop in Fleet-market; have you a shop in Fleet-market, or is it in Field-lane?
No, Field-lane, Fleet-market; (produces the shoes;) I have had them ever since.
I am journeyman to the prosecutor: I went into the shop when the prisoner was trying on the shoes; I saw her stuffing something under her petticoat; she said there were none that would fit her, and she was going out of the shop; my master stopped her, and said, you have got some of my property about you; she made answer, that she had not; he immediately began to search her, and three shoes tumbled from under her petticoats upon the ground; he took them up, and took her and the shoes to the Compter.
He told me at the Compter, if I would pay for the shoes he would let me go; I told him I should not pay for what I knew nothing about; he knocked me down in his shop, and used me very ill.
(To Coleman.) Did you offer to let her go if she would pay for the shoes?
No, I did not. NOT GUILTY .
