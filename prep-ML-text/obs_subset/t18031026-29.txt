- I am a leather-cutter , No. 183, Shoreditch : On the evening of the 22d of October, about nine o'clock at night, the prisoner, in company with another woman, came into my shop to purchase some leather; I sent her into the cellar with a little girl, and a candle to light her, to look out what she wanted; I went into the cellar with another customer myself; she stopped in the cellar with the little girl about two minutes; I was at the other end of the cellar, and told the little girl to light her up; when she came into the shop, she told the woman with whom she came in, that she wanted to go out to speak to a closer or binder-woman; she told the woman to wait, she would be in again in a minute; when I came up, she had just returned, she looked out some leather in the shop, had it weighed, and paid for it; she went away; about a quarter of an hour after, I missed a bundle containing sixteen pieces of welting leather, I suspected the prisoner had got it; I instantly enquired where she lived, went to the watch-house, and laid an information, the officer of the night went with me to the house; I told her, I had missed a bundle of leather, and suspected she had it; she said, she knew nothing of it; I saw some leather lying upon the floor, just behind her, I instantly went to it, and found it was the property I had missed; the officer then took her into custody; she had been a customer about a fortnight.
I believe this poor woman has a husband who is a maniac?
She has a husband who is deranged, and two children.
This leather was not in your shop, but in the cellar?
No, it was not exposed for sale.
Is your cellar a part of your shop?
We consider it so, because we keep in it articles for sale as well as articles not for sale; this leather is not manufactured, it is not in a saleable condition.
