On the 23d of January, between two and three o'clock, I lost a game cock, from Sloane-street , it was on the outside of the door among other fowls, I saw it again about an hour afterwards; the prisoner came past, and in consequence of my wife's suspicion I pursued him down Sloane-street, he took to his heels; when he got to the corner of the first turning, I saw him chuck away something in a bag, over the rails; I stopped him, and he asked me what I wanted with him; I I told him he must come back; he got away from me, nobody would come to my assistance; I went after him again, and caught him again; as I was bringing him back, a boy brought me a bag with my sowl in it.
Is that boy here?
No, I have not seen him since; I took the prisoner before Mr. Bond, who was sitting at the Prince of Wales's, and there another bag was found upon him, but nothing in it.
Was the sowl dead, or alive?
Alive.
I am the wife of the last witness; I saw a man, whom I believe to be the prisoner, just before the sowl was missing, but I cannot swear he is the same man.
I was going to work at Mr. Benwell's, in Sloane-street, all night; I was running pretty fast down Sloane-street, when this man came up, and said I had stole his sowl; it is a very likely story that I should steal his sowl, and come past the door again within an hour after.
