I am a merchant : On Tuesday, the 21st of December last, between three and four o'clock in the afternoon, I was going westward through Fleet-street, on the northward side of the way; when I got near Templebar , I heard a call of stop; behind me; upon which I turned round, put my hand to my pocket, and missed my handkerchief; I then stepped back a few yards, and saw a handkerchief in a man's hand, which I immediately said was mine; he said, I know it is, for I saw this man (he had hold of the prisoner), take it out of your pocket. He was then delivered to a constable, with the handkerchief.
I am a confectioner: On the 21st of December, crossing from my master's house, I saw the prisoner with two other young men; the prisoner put his hand in Mr. Bentley's right-hand pocket, and took out a silk handkerchief; I immediately collared him; he then dropped the handkerchief, and I picked it up; I called to the prosecutor to stop, he came back, and seeing the handkerchief in my hand, he said it was his; we then took him to the constable's house.
I have nothing to say, I throw myself on the mercy of the Court.
