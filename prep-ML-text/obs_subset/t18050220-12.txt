I live at Aldgate : I can only prove that part of the goods were found in the prisoner's custody.
I am an Officer of Lambeth-street: on the 22d of January this man was brought to our Office, about the middle of the day, charged with a felony; he had a large bag, containing various articles, and among them I found this piece of flannel; I asked him where he bought the different things; he said, he bought some at Mr. Weddell's, and told me where Mr. Weddell lived, and amongst the cloth I found this card; I carried it to Mr. Weddell, who owned the card and the cloth.
Look at that cloth; what is it?
It is a Salisbury flannel; I know it is mine by the card, otherwise I should not; I had such flannel in my house, but I did not know I had lost it till the Officer came; then I searched and found it was missing; the card has our private mark on it, and it belongs to this piece of flannel.
Where was it when it was in your shop?
In the window.
Do you think you can swear you had this stuff in your shop two days before I came to your shop
I would not wish to swear that.
Was the card fixed to the cloth when it came back?
It was loose.
Then upon looking over that card, does it satisfy your mind that that piece of Salisbury flannel was the same flannel to which the card was affixed?
I could think it was, and the quantity taken corresponds with the quantity left exactly.
A Jew that travels about declared to me, that Mr. Weddell had sold that piece of stuff to him three weeks before I bought it; he is at Portsmouth, on board of a man of war, with slops.
