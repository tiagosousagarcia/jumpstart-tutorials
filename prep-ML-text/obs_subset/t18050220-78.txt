You are the wife of Mr. William Page , of Liquorpond-street ?
I am.
What is your husband?
A pawn-broker and salesman .
Are there two shops or one?
Two shops united in each other.
Are they both in the same street?
Yes.
Do you remember the prisoner at any time last year coming to your shop?
Yes, on the night of the 22d of December.
Do you recollect her person?
Very well.
For what purpose did she come there?
To purchase a broach, and she also purchased a pair of wire ear-rings as well as a broach.
How did she pay for them?
She paid for them with a two pound bank-note.
Did you take any notice of the note with which she paid you?
I took notice of the note with which she paid me; it was quite a new one.
Were there any marks by which you should know it again?
There was small writing on the back, but I did not particularly observe it; I did not look much where the writing was; there was K. B. between the Britannia and the two; it was signed Phillips.
Is that the note? (handing it to her) - A . That is the note which I took of her.
What did you do with that note when you had taken it of the prisoner?
I put it into the till which we usually keep money in immediately; I saw it again on Sunday morning.
When did she come?
On the Saturday night the 22d of December, as is my usual custom, I took the money out of the till on Saturday night, and on Sunday morning Mr. Page discovered this to be a bad note.
When did you part with that note?
I do not exactly remember which day of the week it was, I think it was on the Tuesday following.
To whom did you part with it?
To a gentleman of the name of Lewis.
Did it go out of your hands before you parted with it to Mr. Lewis?
No, I gave it to Mr. Lewis myself.
Are you certain of the person of the prisoner?
I am certain of the person of the prisoner.
You say you never parted with this note till you gave it to Mr. Lewis?
No, it never was out of my possession.
You discovered on Sunday morning it was a bad note?
No, Mr. Page discovered it.
How came you to pass it to Mr. Lewis, you understanding it to be a bad one?
I keep a pocket book with notes for payment, I had put this with the rest and passed it without any intention.
You passed it to Mr. Lewis?
I did.
Do you mean to swear that on Sunday morning, your husband knew that it was a bad note?
Yes.
And you knew it as well as your husband?
Yes.
So that when you knew that as well as your husband you passed it to a tradesman?
I do not know whether he is a tradesman or not, I believe he is a gentleman.
How long was it after you gave it to Mr. Lewis, before you saw it again?
On the 30th.
You took it on the Saturday, and on the Sunday you knew it to be a bad one, on the Tuesday you parted with it, and on the subsequent Sunday you saw it again?
Yes.
You manage the business of one shop, and your husband the other?
Yes.
Your's is not a pawnbroker's shop?
No; it is a sale shop.
This transaction took place between you and the prisoner on Saturday night?
Yes.
That is generally the busiest night for pawnbrokers?
Yes.
Therefore, of necessity, you take more money then than on other days?
I do not.
There is more money taken on Saturday in your house than on other days?
Yes.
Had you known the prisoner at the bar before Saturday?
I never saw her before in my life.
What did she purchase?
She purchased a broach for twelve shillings, and a pair of wire ear rings for three shillings; she dealt with me for the broach, and with my niece for the ear-rings.
Was there any body else in the shop?
There was a person that came into the shop to buy some gold rings.
Was not she looking at the same articles as the prisoner?
No, she was not.
Do you mean to say whether she was in company with her or not?
I do not know, they went out at the same time.
Some few minutes past before you took the note, you had no suspicion that it was a bad one, or else you would not have taken it?
No.
You did not write upon the note at the time you took it?
I did not; I made an observation that there was K. B. upon it and signed by the name of Philips.
You had a great many other bank-notes?
No.
You say this bank-note was never out of your possession, till you gave it to Mr. Lewis; do you mean to say that you are accurate in that?
I do.
How came your husband to say it was a bad note?
I took the money out of the till on the Saturday night, and on Sunday it is our usual custom to look it over, I sat by when he looked over the cash, it was all put together.
Do you make your husband your cashier?
No, I keep the money myself.
Do you collect your money every Saturday, or every night, or do you do it once a week?
We do not keep any account of the sale-shop, the pawnbroker's shop is kept separate.
I ask you whether you account with your husband oftener than once a week?
I never account with him at all, I keep it myself in general, and if he wants any I give it him.
Does he look over your money more than once a week?
More particularly on the Sunday, because he has more time.
Had the prisoner been in your shop upon any accident happening to one of the wires of the ear-rings?
Yes, she brought it back; at the time they were sold they were supposed to be correct, and they were to the best of my knowledge.
Did not the prisoner, shortly after, in the same night, return and tell you one was a broken wire, and desire you to change it?
Yes.
How long after?
Within a quarter of an hour.
Did not she advance you some ready money to induce you to change the wire?
She gave me sixpennyworth of halfpence.
Had not you taken any other 2 l. note?
Upon my word I cannot tell.
Did you put it with others?
Not till I looked at it.
And then you put it with the others?
There might be others, I cannot say.
Was there any other 2 l. note whatever marked K.B. or signed Philips, in that part of the drawer in which you put that note?
No.
You had no other note marked K.B. and signed Philips?
No.
How came you to give it to Mr. Lewis?
I gave it inadvertently; he purchased some things of me, and gave me a 5 l. note, for which I had to give him 3 l. 6 s. he said I should like to have your name upon it; Mr. Page came into the shop, and he said, be so good as to put your name upon it; then I desired his address, and W.P. was put upon the note.
Look at the note?
This is the note; there is the W.P. that was marked by Mr. Page before it was given to Mr. Lewis.
Be so good as to look at the front of the note, at the K.B; is that the note you took of the prisoner?
Yes, I think I could swear it.
When did you discover that you had given this to Mr. Lewis?
Mr. Page discovered it the same evening, and was very angry; he was to have seen Mr. Bliss, the Inspector of the Bank, the next morning, and was going to give him this note; Mr. Page took every pains that was in his power to get the note again.
You are the niece of the last witness?
Yes.
Do you recollect the prisoner at the bar coming into your aunt's shop?
Yes.
You are an Inspector of the Bank, and, in consequence of information you received, you went to the house of the prisoner, on Saturday the 29th of December in the afternoon?
In consequence of some information I went to the prisoner's house; when the officers apprehended her they searched her house; there was a miniature painting lying in the front parlour where the prisoner was; I asked the prisoner whose picture that was, she said it was her husband's; I asked her if Cornelius Holt was her husband; she said she was married to him, it was her husband.
How came you to put that question to her with that name, Cornelius Holt ?
I thought it was a miniature-picture of Cornelius Holt .
Had you any knowledge of such a person?
I had a knowledge of Holt, it struck me that it was like him, and thought that it was the picture of him.
When you were with the woman, and the officers had taken her into custody, what passed between her and you?
She said that Holt was her husband, and that she was married to him, and soon after the officers had done searching her she seemed violently agitated, and said, Oh! that villain, Holt, will bring me at last to the gallows! then she was taken in a coach to Bow-street: we stopped at Mr. Page's, in Liquorpond-street; I went in the coach with her, and stopped there with the prisoner and the officer; she went into the shop and saw Mrs. Page, and Jane Ramsey , her niece; they both saw her, and said that was the woman that had been there.
What passed between you and the prisoner, or between the prisoner and any body else?
In conversation with Mrs. Page, Mrs. Page asked her about the ear-rings and the broach; she said, if I did buy a broach, it is disposed of; you will not see it again; you may take and hang me by the neck, or what you will, I will never say what I have done with it; she acknowledged being there, and buying the ear-rings and something else.
Were there any questions put to her, how she paid for them?
Mrs. Page, in the presence of the prisoner, said that she had paid her a 2 l. note, and Jane Ramsey was called upon to see if she knew the prisoner, and she recollected that she was present.
What said the prisoner upon Mrs. Page saying that she had paid her a 2 l. note?
She said first that she had paid her a 2 l. note, and afterwards said that she did not, but that she paid her in money.
Did any thing more particularly pass in the shop at that time?
Not particularly, that I recollect; she was then taken to Bow-street.
Before you came to the Office did any thing pass between you and her that was material?
When she was in the coach, she cried and seemed very much agitated; she said once that she would never say any thing against Holt; when she was at Bow-street I went up to one of the officers, for him to go somewhere, and she said, when you take me to the bar at the Old Bailey, you will cut just as good a figure with me there as you did with Mr. Holt; it was me that helped to get Mr. Holt clear; I spoke to Mr. Pecker and some of the other witnesses, and instructed them what to say. I went away then for one of the officers that had not come down. When I went up again she said, you are Mr. Bliss, are you, of the Bank? if I am a Bank prisoner I will be kept well, and have a woman to wait upon me.
When was it before this day in December that you had seen Mr. Page?
He applied to me about the 26th of October, and from that to the 30th, I had been with him several times.
You gave him some advice, I do not ask you what that advice was?
I gave him some advice, and he gave me a 2 l. note.
What time in the evening was it when you went to the prisoner's house?
It was in the evening, just at candlelight.
What state of mind was the woman in at the time she was apprehended?
She seemed very uneasy, and very much agitated; she cried, and made the most violent noise, she and her little girl; I said to Crocker, I believe she does it to alarm somebody that is at the door; I desired him to take her into the back room.
Did she appear to be quite collected, or did she seem to have had some drink after dinner?
She was very much agitated; she said so many things that were real facts and truths, that she was certainly collected, or else she could not have said so many things as she did say.
Had her agitation the appearance of having drank too much after dinner, or was it occasioned by the officers searching her?
I cannot say that her agitation had the appearance of having drank after dinner; I should rather think it was from her apprehension, and from the officer searching her.
Do you remember in the morning saying to her, now you are sober, give me an account - Did you make any observation to her of her being sober the next morning?
I thought at first the woman appeared as though she had drank something; she seemed agitated and cried.
Was she kept from liquor, or was it desired by you and the officer that liquor should be kept from her?
I desired that she might have a good bed; I desired her to have every thing that was proper.
Had not she brandy by your order?
I said that every thing she wanted she was to have.
Did not you desire that she should have spirits; aye or no?
Upon my life I do not recollect that I did.
Had she any?
The woman seemed ill, and if she asked for any I should have had no particular objection to her having that or any thing else.
Had she not some spirits at Bow-street, before you had any conversation with her?
I do not know; I desired her to have a comfortable bed prepared, and every thing that was proper for a woman.
Did it strike you that her agitation was the effect of having had too much liquor, or in consequence of her being searched?
I do assure you that I thought it was in consequence of her being searched, and her apprehension.
Was she searched?
Yes, the officer searched her.
Was any thing found upon her?
I believe not.
The whole of it is a forgery, it is a most horrid composition, it is not an engraving, it is done with a hair pencil all through.
Holt was tried was he?
Yes.
You are a pawnbroker, in Liquorpond-street?
Yes.
Do you remember at any time in October last the prisoner coming to you and pledging any thing?
I believe it was on the 6th of October.
Did she pledge any articles with you?
She pledged a gown, a petticoat, a broach, and a pair of ear-rings.
In what name did she pledge them?
In the name of Mary Jenkins .
What did you lend her upon them?
Sixteen shillings.
This was on the 6th of October; did she afterwards come for the purpose of redeeming these articles?
She came to redeem them on the 27th of October.
What did she give you, or offer for payment, to redeem these articles?
A 2 l. note; she had another ticket of a silk cloak, pledged at our shop in the name of Jane Jones ; she redeemed that also for 2 s. 6 d.
Was this late or early in the evening of the 27th?
It was, I rather think, a little after eleven o'clock, just at the time we were going to shut up the door.
What did you do with that note - Is this the note?
This is the note I received for the pledge, on the 27th of October, here is the mark that I made on it, on Sunday morning, I know it to be the same, I had no other two pound note in the till at all.
That note which you received from her you put in the till?
Yes, I had it on Saturday night, and on Sunday morning, looking over my accounts, which is usual in pawn-brokers' shops, I discovered this note to be a bad one, and then I put the memorandum on it, and that was the only two pound note there was in the till.
Did you take no other in the course of the day?
I do not think that I did.
In the course of the day you took notes, and put them away?
Yes.
This was the last transaction that evening?
I do not believe that there was any other person came into the shop after her.
When you discovered it to be a bad one did you make any application to the Bank?
Yes, in the course of a day or two I applied to Mr. Bliss.
Did the prisoner afterwards, at any future time, come to your shop?
I do not know of my own knowledge.
Look at that note, see if it has your initials at the back of it, and state to my Lord and the Jury how you came to put your initials upon it?
I was busy in the pawnbroker's shop; a few days after it was taken I came into the sale-shop for some change, and Mrs. Page had been dealing with a gentleman for some articles, and he wished change for a five-pound note.
That gentleman was Mr. Lewis?
Yes, he asked me to put my initials on the note, and accordingly I did so; I afterwards asked him his name and address to put on the five-pound note, which he gave to Mrs. Page.
Is that the five-pound note which Mr. Lewis gave you?
It is.
When did you first see that two-pound note again?
On the 23d of December.
Who shewed it you?
I asked Mrs. Page for the cash, and on looking over the notes I discovered this to be a bad one; there had been one taken in the pawnbroker's shop the same evening, and I supposed that to be a bad one at the time.
When you discovered the note which you hold in your hand, did you give any directions to Mrs. Page?
Yes.
What time of the day was it when your wife brought that note to you?
She did not bring it to me, I went out of one shop into the other.
You were not particularly occupied at the other shop?
Yes, I was; I came into the shop to get some silver at the time.
How came you to put down Mr. Lewis's address?
To know what I was about; I had time enough to write it, but I was in a hurry, and when I had done it, I immediately went into the other shop.
If you had known the note was bad you would have stopped it; at the time you gave Mr. Lewis the note you were not aware of the identity of the note?
I was not.
There were a great number of notes together?
I do not know how many there might be.
You made your observation upon it on the Sunday, and after the Sunday you did not know it again when it was put into the pocket book?
I returned it back to Mrs. Page, and she put it into the pocket-book on the Sunday.
You only know it is the same note you gave to Mr. Lewis by the indorsement, but at the time you gave it you did not know it was the bad note, and your wife was with you at the time you gave it, and had the same opportunity of knowing it?
She was.
This woman pawned something on the 6th of October, did she give you a correct address?
Yes.
In consequence of that you were able to find out where she resided?
Yes.
The duplicate remained with you after the things were redeemed, so that still you knew where to find her?
Yes.
On Saturday night the things were redeemed?
Yes.
How many shopmen do you employ?
One shopman.
Had you supped at that time?
No.
You have told my Lord and the gentlemen of the Jury, that on the next morning you did not find any other two pound note, but how many other two pound notes you had on the same day you cannot tell?
I cannot.
You cannot tell how many you had changed in the course of that day?
No.
Nor at night?
No.
At the time of taking the note you had no suspicion?
No.
She gave you the two shillings and sixpence in cash?
Yes, I had given her a one pound-note and the rest in change.
I was asking you whether this was not the last transaction that night?
I believe it to be the last transaction that evening.
With respect to the note that you marked with your initials, is that the note that you received in October?
It is the note that my wife received when I had the cash of her, and that was given to Mr. Lewis, that I marked with my initials.
That is another that you wrote the prisoner's name to?
Yes.
My friend asked you about a pocket-book; that was not your pocket-book?
It is the pocket-book that is kept in the sale-shop; it is generally in the care of Mrs. Page; she always takes care of it in the evening.
Did you, before you signed that note, make any observation on it?
No, I was in a hurry, and went into the other shop after I had signed it.
With or without looking at it?
I did not take any notice of it, I did not look at it, I put my initials on it, and being in a hurry, I went into the other shop immediately.
Did you then observe it to be a bad note?
No, I was not aware of it, I did not think any thing about it, I only wrote my initials in a hurry, Mrs. Page had given him the change.
What are you?
I am an excise officer, in the silk office.
Do you remember at any time changing a five-pound note at Mr. Page's shop?
I do.
What did you receive in change?
I received three pounds six shillings, I paid him one pound fourteen shillings.
Did you receive any two pound note?
Yes, Mr. Page put his initials on it.
When did you return that?
On Sunday morning, the 30th of December.
Who applied to you?
Mr. Page applied to me, and a person with him; I had passed it; I went with Mr. Page to the person, and Mr. Page gave the person another two pound note for it; I knew the note when I saw it again.
Can you say positively whether the note you received from Mr. Page was the note that you returned to him?
I can.
Is that a counterfeit?
The whole of it is counterfeit, and the outlines are of the same texture with the other note, it is the same kind of paper, it is not printed; this note was in my possession the 30th of October, that was near two months before the other note was taken.
What age are you?
I am sixteen; I live with Mr. Page, I am his apprentice.
Look at the prisoner at the bar?
It is the same woman that came into the shop on the 27th of October; I am sure it is the woman.
Do you recollect what time of the night it was?
Very near shutting up time.
What is your usual time for shutting up on a Saturday night?
Eleven o'clock; it was near to that time.
Does your recollection serve you to say whether there was any person in the shop after her?
I do not think there was.
When you say you do not think there was, there might be for any thing you know; your business is not in the shop, your business is to go up and down to the warehouse?
I came down with that parcel, and unpinned it.
When you bring down a parcel you go up again?
I was not up after that person came, I did not go back again that night.
How was she dressed at that time of night?
She had a red cloak on and a black bonnet.
Are you certain of having a knowledge of that woman from the dress that she had on then?
Yes.
Look at the prisoner at the bar, is that the person you saw in the shop?
I have no doubt of it.
And you have no doubt that she is the person who came to change the ear-rings also?
She came to change the ear rings.
I see it is there Bank on England instead of Bank of England. It is not a Bank-note.
There is a count in the indictment for a promissory note; it comes within that.
Do you remember the prisoner at the bar being in custody?
I do; I am an officer of Bow-street.
Do you remember Mr. Bliss going out of the room at any time?
I do.
Do you remember the prisoner making any observation at that time?
The prisoner said, that is Mr. Bliss, is it, then I am mum, he shall get nothing out of me, they shall hang me first, that I recollect passed at the Brown Bear.
She had some brandy and water to drink at the Brown Bear?
No.
You had been asking her to give some information against her husband?
No, I was in company all the time she was in our house, and I went with Mr. Bliss and the prisoner to the office: I heard all that was said.
I am not guilty, I never took any thing out in my life from Mr. Page; I took two gowns from one of his shopmen, on Saturday night, and I gave him a one pound note and he gave me a shilling, and as to the broach I never bought one of Mrs. Page, I bought two pair of ear rings; Mr. Bliss ordered me brandy, and behaved very ill to me indeed; he used me extremely ill, and told me I should be hanged, for Mr. Holt had given me the notes; I told him I never had them of him in my life.
