I am a publican , I keep the Blue-last in Black stairs; I lost a very number of pots; On the 24th of March, the prisoner was in the tap-room that evening about half past seven; in consequence of an information, I followed her on to Ludgate-hill, and caught her in a little court, just before the came to her own door; I found two pewter pots in her pocket, (the constable produced the pots).
These are my pots.
I had two pints from the prosecutor that day, that I did not wish my husband to know; I saw the prosecutor afterwards, and told him I had them.
Did she tell you she had them?
No; she did not.
The prosecutor offered me a guinea if I would inform him how many pots had been stolen before.
Did you offer her a guinea?
No, I did not.
I have known the prisoner about four or five years, she bears a general good character.
