I live in Swan-alley, Lower East Smithfield , in the parish of St. Botolph, Aldgate ; I was not at home at the time it happened.
I am the wife of the last witness; at six in the morning of the 21st of June, my house was broke open; I heard the prisoner come into my apartments, I am sure he is the man; my brother lodges in my house, and as he passed, he said, are you awake, I said, yes, and just after, I heard somebody up in the two pair of stairs room, I heard a chest opened; a person went after him and brought him back, the witness's name is Thomas M'Gee; I saw him drop the property from under his arm as he went past my door.
What property?
A coat.
Was any part of your house broke open?
No; the outer door was upon the latch; my brother is here, he shut it when he went out.
I lodge in my sister's house; I went out about a quarter before six in the morning, as near as I can guess, I pulled the door after me, and left it upon the latch.
Are you sure you fastened the door?
Yes.
I heard a cry of stop thief, I caught the prisoner, I found nothing upon him.
I was coming down Nightingale-lane, I turned down by a sence, where there was a public privy; I went down to it, and that man came up to me, and told me, I must go with him; I behaved with no violence; I told him, I was going to my daily labour, and being the only man that was there, that woman said, that is the fellow; I know nothing at all about it.
