I am the wife of James Bartlett; the prisoner is a sailor , and lodged with me at Shadwell ; before that, he lodged with me six months; I keep the Globe and Three Pigeons : On the 4th of October, I gave him a pocket-book, containing his certificate; he was going to Greenwich to get his pension; I had forgot that I had put nine one-pound Bank-notes, and a two-pound Bank-note into the pocket-book; I am sure they were in it; I was going to pay them away; he brought me back the pocket-book and a two-pound note; I never saw the other notes again: he said, they had given him the two-pound note for subsistence money.
I apprehended the prisoner in a public-house, opposite the India-house; he was entirely new dressed, with a watch, and some extravagant bills in his pocket; he told me he had got ten pounds from Greenwich.
