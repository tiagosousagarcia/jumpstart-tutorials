On Tuesday, December the 11th, about half past three in the afternoon, I had been out with a load; just before I came home I met a man with a firkin of butter, he was in a very great hurry, the prisoner is the man; I looked round, I saw it was my master's property by the marks; I ran into my master's house to know if they had sold a firkin of butter to a strange man, they said no, then I ran after him, and took him with the firkin of butter, and held him till the officer came to assist me; I took him to my master's house, he rested on a post, he was tying round his blue apron as I suppose to hide it; I asked him what he did with it, he said, let me go, let me go, you have got the firkin of butter; I knew it to be my master's butter, by H. O. R. in a chalk-mark.
My lord, the firkin of butter was put down in the corner of the street, and I took it up, and carried it to the post on purpose for somebody to own it; I did not take it out of the shop, nor never stole it, have no witnesses.
