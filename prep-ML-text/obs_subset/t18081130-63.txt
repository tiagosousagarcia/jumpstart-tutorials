I am a victualler , I live at the Brill house, Somers' Town.
Did you empower the prisoner to take your money
Yes; from where he had taken out beer. On the night of the 8th of October I had occasion to go in the country; when I returned I found he was gone, and received this account.
What did he receive of Mary Harting
Money for beer which I had supplied her with.
What was she in your debt
Four and six pence, what he received on his last account; the bill was more, what we had got against her; he kept account of the beer, when he returned he gave me account of it.
You deal with the Brill house for beer
Yes.
Were you indebted to him
I cannot say.
What did you pay
I do not know exactly.
These are customers that used to pay weekly, I never gave them any bill; I used to put it in any book. I believe the magistrate has the bill.
Have you got your book here
No. I never received the money.
