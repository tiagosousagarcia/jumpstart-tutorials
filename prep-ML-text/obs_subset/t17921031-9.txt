I am officer to the West India merchants; the prisoner had charge of the lighter between five and six in the afternoon; he was watchman ; he came up the ladder, and I said he had a bundle; I searched him, and he had some sugar tied in a handkerchief, and his great coat wrapped in it; he said he brought it from the ship, the Hannah, from Jamaica; Wells saw me take it; he had a little bag in his jacket and another in his breeches.
I know no more than the last witness; we found this (a cane scoop) in his pocket; it is not a thing commonly used on board a ship.
