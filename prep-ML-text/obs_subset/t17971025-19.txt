I am the wife of James Galloway: On the 28th of September, the prisoner came to our house, and pretended that he was an uncle of Mr. Galloway's; he said, he had made a very handsome fortune abroad, he had got a ship loaded with bale goods, and he wanted to do something very handsome for his friends; he said, Mr. Galloway was his nephew, and had a right to a share of it; he drank his tea, and part of three bottles of wine; I lit him up to bed, and locked him in, and put the key in my pocket; he wanted to see what fort of a bed I had got to lie on, for he was sure it was very mean; in the morning he wanted to borrow a guinea of me, I would not lend him a guinea; some time after, somebody wanted change for two dollars, he snatched the two dollars out of my hand, and refused to give them me again; he went into the bar and took a bottle of brandy; I sent to Bow-street for a constable, the constable took him into the parlour, and searched him, and found the dollars on him.
I searched him, and found two dollars in his right-hand pocket.
I cannot swear to the dollars; I did not mark them, but he was not out of the place.
What did he say, when you charged him with having taken them?
He said, he would not give them me, when he did, he would give them me with a very handsome present; the next time I asked him, he said, he would see me d-d first.
Did you believe at that time, that he would make you a present?
No; I told him, I was sure he was an impostor.
I was very-much in liquor; I don't know any thing of it, my brother was just come home from the West-Indies, and I was so overjoyed at seeing him again, that I did not know what I did.
He was a little in liquor, but not insensible of what was passing.
