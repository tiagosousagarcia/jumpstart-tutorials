I live at No. 4, Phoenix street . The prisoner has lodged in my house, and since that she has frequently come to my house. I missed my things; the officer searched her lodgings, and found the duplicates, and the pawnbroker produced the things.
I am an officer. On the 28th of December, I went to the prisoner's lodgings, Compton street, St. Giles's, I searched her box, and found these two linen handkerchiefs in her box; in her pocket I found some duplicates, they are the duplicates. The prisoner said she had found them.
I am a pawnbroker, High street, St. Giles's. The prisoner at the bar pledged a sheet, two handkerchiefs, and a remnant of dimity with me.
She lent me these things, we were in the habit of lending one another things.
