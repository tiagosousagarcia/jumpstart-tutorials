I am a labourer in Mr. Rixon's yard: I saw the prisoner take these iron hoops, between three and four o'clock; he went into the seasoning-house, and brought the hoops out upon his shoulder; I followed him and took him: I saw him go in without hoops, and come out with them. There were not any hoops in that place, but what were the property of Rixon.
