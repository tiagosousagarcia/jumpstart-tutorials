I am employed in the East-India Company's warehouse, which overlooks the Hambro' wharf: On Wednesday, the 5th of May, I saw the prisoner, between seven and eight in the morning, take some sugar out of a kind of butter-firkin, put it in a paper, and tie it up in a handkerchief; he put the head of the small cask on, and went away; in a little time he came back, opened the cask again, took some more out, tied it up, put the head of the cask in, and went away; I acquainted Mr. Sills with it, and the prisoner was detained.
How far were you from him?
It was three stories high.
You could see the sort of sugar?
Yes, it was moist sugar.
How many people were on the wharf?
Nobody but the prisoner that I saw.
The quantity of sugar you don't know?
No.
I was with Shorey, and saw the prisoner take the sugar, as he has stated.
My partners, Jonathan Sills , Joseph Sills , and myself, are proprietors of the Hambro' wharf: The prisoner had been our porter about two months; upon the information given us, we examined the cask, and there was a deficiency, but I cannot speak to the exact quantity; we searched the prisoner's lodgings, and found 10lb. of sugar in a pan, and 14lb. of soap; I compared the sugar with that in the cask, and it corresponded exactly; and I found that half a cwt. of soap was missing; I compared the soap, and it corresponded with that in the warehouse; the prisoner said he bought them, but could not tell where.
Neither the sugar or soap you can swear to?
Not positively; but, to the best of my belief, it is mine.
Sugar of the same quality is to be found in every grocer's shop in London?
Certainly.
There are losses in all casks of sugar, I believe?
Yes, occasional losses too many, I am sorry to say.
You speak to the soap by comparison?
Yes.
Damaged soap is no uncommon thing?
No.
I leave my defence to my counsel.
