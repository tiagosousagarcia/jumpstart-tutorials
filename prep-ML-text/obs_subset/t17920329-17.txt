I am wife to the prosecutor; I am a laundress, and employed the prisoner to work for me; we live at No. 5, in the New-road.
I work for the laundresses: the prisoner gave me two tickets; I had heard that Mrs. Barker had lost two shifts, and I carried the tickets to Mrs. Barker directly; the prisoner was once a laundress herself; I have worked for her.
I am a pawnbroker; I produce two shifts; I received them from the prisoner. (Produces the shifts.)
I received two tickets from Mary Frogley ; one of these shifts is mine; another belongs to a lady; the mark is nearly out.
I have nothing at all to say.
