I am a publican ; I know nothing of the loss myself.
I was sitting at work in my shop about a quarter before nine in the evening, I heard somebody fall down at the street door; I went to the door, and saw the prisoner very much in liquor, and with the pots under his coat; I took four pots from him.
I had been at work at Paddington all day, and found these pots in the Park as I was coming home.
