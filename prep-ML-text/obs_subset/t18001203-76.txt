- Mr. Hart lives at the corner of Clare-court , he is a linen-draper , and I am his shopman: On Tuesday, the 18th of November, I was standing behind the counter, a little after four o'clock, serving a customer, and a person came to the door, and said, there is a man run away with a piece of goods from the door; I jumped over the counter, and run down Drury-lane; I saw a man go into White-hart-yard; I pursued him down Swan-yard, and perceived he had something under his arm; I followed him into the Strand, and called stop thief; he turned up Catherine-street, and about the middle I overtook him with the goods under his arm; these are the goods, I know them by my own mark.
At the corner of Catherine-street, I saw a man running with this piece of goods, a man called stop thief, he dropped it, and I picked it up.
