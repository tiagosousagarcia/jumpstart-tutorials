On last Saturday was se'nnight the prisoner being brought upon some charge before the Lord Mayor, I was ordered to search his box; upon searching his box I found in it a handkerchief and stock (producing them) the prisoner had the key of the box; but before he delivered the key he denied that it was his box. At first he said the handkerchief was his; upon being further questioned he denied it.
The prisoner was servant to my brother. The things that were found are my property. They have my mark upon them; they were kept in a chest of drawers, which were unlocked, in my room.
Might not the things have been left about the house?
Yes, they might; I was dressed sometimes above stairs and sometimes below. The prisoner used to carry my things.
The prisoner lived with me a few days. I was present when the things were found in the box. He had handkerchiefs as good as my brother's, and things of the same kind.
I leave my defence to my counsel.
I am a stock-broker. I have known the prisoner five years; I have heard he has a good character from his master he lived with in Broad-street. I have heard him speak very well of him. I always heard that he was a very honest worthy fellow. I really believe him to be such.
I am a silversmith in the strand. I have known the prisoner near a twelvemonth; I never heard any thing to his disadvantage in my life. He has bought little articles and a brother of his has bought things of a brother of mine.
I have some of the same mark as that handkerchief in my pocket; they are marked I G.
