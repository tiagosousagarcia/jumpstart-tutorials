I keep a shop in St. Alban's-street, St. James's : On Saturday the 3d of November, the prisoner at the bar, with another woman in company, came into my shop; the prisoner at the bar placed herself at the counter opposite to me, and the other woman upon her right-hand; she asked to look at a pair of black stockings, I took a parcel down and opened to shew her; she said, they would not do, she wanted to see some other stockings; I went the distance of about four yards, and took down another parcel; when I turned my head, I saw the prisoner drawing her arm from my shop-window, and put it under her cloak, there is an inside sliding shutter which was open at that time; I opened a parcel of stockings that I had been taking down just before to shew her them; she asked me the price, I told her the price was two shillings a pair; she said, no, she would give me eighteen-pence; I told her two shillings was the lowest price, and if they did not suit her at that price there was no occasion to give herself any further trouble; she said she would give me nineteen-pence; I told her it was in vain to offer me any thing less then I asked; then she said she would give me twenty-pence; I told her they should not go under two shillings; then she would give me one-and-twenty-pence, then she came to two-and-twenty-pence; I should observe, that she had a barrow at the door with apples in it; she asked me then if I would take any apples in part of payment; I told her, no, I would have no apples, we had apples in the house; then she addressed herself to my wife, to know if she would take any apples; then she told me she would leave a shilling with me till next Saturday, I might keep the stockings and the shilling till then, and then she would come for them; I told her if she had not got the money to leave the stockings, and she might have them next Saturday when she came for them, and bring the money with her; she put her hand in her pocket and took out money, I saw a half-crown-piece, two shillings, and two sixpences, with some halfpence, but she said she could not spare the money now; the woman that was along with her had a young child with her; she asked my wife to shew her some calico, and she went further into the shop to get it; there was some calico upon the counter, but my wife told her it was sold, and upon that lay a bed-gown, and she said she should like it for her child; she then cruddled down, seemingly with intent to adjust her child's dress; she then stood up, and said she was very ill, and as we could not agree about the price, she must go; she put her hand upon mine, and said she was in a high fever, but she appeared to me to be in a damp swear; she went out of the shop, and in three or four minutes after she was gone out of the shop, the prisoner at the bar desired me to pick her out one of the best pair of stockings that was in the parcel, which I did, and then she put down one shilling and sixpence on the counter; they talked together different time in their own dialect, which I did not understand, which I believe to be Irish; when the prisoner put down the shilling and sixpence, I asked her what that was for; she said, it was the money she had agreed to give me for the stockings; I told her I should not let her have them; she went away, and as soon as she was gone I missed ten silk handkerchiefs, I followed her about the distance of nine or ten houses, and told her I wanted to speak to her a my shop; she asked me what I wanted; I did not give her any positive answer, I brought her back into my shop; I rung the bell for the servant-maid, I desired my maid to keep her in custody. and I went out to meet with her companion; I was gone six or seven minutes, in the course of which time the prisoner had made her escape out of the shop; at the distance of about ten houses, as I was coming back. I saw my servant-maid with a gentleman's servant in pursait of her, I went with them and brought her back; the beadle of the parish was upon the spot, I brought her back and had her searched, but could not find the property; she was taken to Marlborough-street and committed.
Did you ever find any of your handkerchiefs?
Yes, I found three of them since at a pawnbroker's; the officer belonging to the office found them.
Should you know them again?
I know them no further than they were like them; the ten were all in one piece.
Then you suppose, that at the time you saw her move her arm from the window, was the time when she took these handkerchiefs?
Yes.
When had you seen them last?
About a quarter of an hour before the prisoner and the other woman came in.
This gentleman called me in to know how I sold my fruit; his wife came into the shop, and said she did not want any; then I asked him to shew me some stockings, and we could not agree, and this woman, that he speaks of, came in while I was there for sixpence and six-pennyworth of halfpence, I never saw the woman before; I know nothing at all of the handkerchiefs.
