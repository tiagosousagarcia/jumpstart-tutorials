I am a servant to a brandy merchant; on the 15th of February, I was going up Chick-lane , and hearing a great noise at a public house, I went in to see what was the matter, and called for a penny worth of beer, the prisoner came up and said, I will be a penny with you, I was going to pay for it, and they knocked the halfpence out of my pocket, and my bundle was gone, I making a piece of work about my bundle, this young woman said, if you will come out, I will tell you who has your bundle, and while she was whispering to me, she whipped the watch out of my pocket, and ran into the house with it.
How do you know she whipped the watch out of your fob?
Because she went out along with me and I felt her do it, and saw her give it to another person, then I went round to several, and I could not tell who had it at last; I saw the prisoner about seven weeks after in Fleet-market, I took her into custody, I was in danger of my life at the first time, I did not know where there was an officer, tho', I have been two years in London, I am a stranger to that part.
How long was it before you went to any magistrate to inform him?
It was two days, we could not find her, then I saw her seven weeks after in Fleet-market, I knew her perfectly well as soon as ever I saw her, she was with two women, I laid hold of her, and sent for a constable, I am sure she is the same person.
What could be the reason when you was robbed, you did not take her?
I did not know where to go for a constable then.
Did not you know where there was any office for the administration of Justice?
I carry out goods as a porter.
What and never heard of the public office of magistrates?
I have nothing at all to say, I never was in his company, he takes me for another person, I am often taken for her, and she for me, I know her very well and where she lives, I have no witnesses.
