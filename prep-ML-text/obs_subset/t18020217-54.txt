I live at No. 69, Chiswell-street : On the 13th of February, we lost a cheese; the prisoner ran up Bunhill-row, and I pursued him into Checquer-ailey, and took him; he threw the cheese down, which I picked up; the cheese had been in the window; I knew it by the dairy; we had many like it. (The cheese produced, and identified.)
I pursued the prisoner with the last witness; he threw the cheese down, and tried to make his escape; I know the cheese, because I weighed the dairy; he begged me to let him go.
I was going up Bunhill-row, I met a man with the cheese, who asked me to carry it to Blue-Anchor-alley, and gave me two-pence; I was going along, and these gentlemen took me.
