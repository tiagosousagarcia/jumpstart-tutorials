I live at the Black-horse, Piccadilly.
Did you lose a sack, two bridles, and a breeching.
They were brought to me on the 7th of January, they were kept in a small room called the ostlery, at the Bolt and Tun in Fleet street; the prisoner had liberty to sleep there, he was employed by a tenant of mine, he was not my direct servant.
I am a constable of Hornsey, I took this man at Hornsey on the 6th of January. I saw an old man offering these things for sale, I saw the old man deliver the things to the prisoner, I asked the prisoner how he came by them, he told me he bought them in Smithfield, but he could not tell the man, he said he lived at the Bolt and Tun; I looked at the sack, I saw the gentleman's name on it. On seeing that, I secured him and brought him down to the Bolt and Tun; the bookkeeper said he left the yard on Sunday morning. I asked the bookkeeper whether he knew these bridles and sack; he said yes.
I bought them in Smithfield market, the Monday in Christmas week.
