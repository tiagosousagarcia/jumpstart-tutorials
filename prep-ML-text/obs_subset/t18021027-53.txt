My husband, David Lewellyn, and I live in Carpenter-street, Westminster ; about the middle of July I missed three tea-spoons, which had been in use; the prisoner has chaired for me ever since March; I saw the spoons again on the 21st of September, at Queen's-square Office.
Did you not employ me to pledge things?
I once did when I had a large bill to make up, which was a counterpane and a gown, before I missed the spoons, that was the only time; I never employed her, or knew she had pledged spoons.
On the 18th of September the prisoner was brought to the watch-house on suspicion of stealing the tea-spoons; she was detained till Monday, and taken before the Magistrate, where she confessed she had pledged the spoons; the Magistrate gave a summons to Mr. Morritt, where she said she had pawned them; I went to the pawnbroker's with a duplicate for a tea-spoon and a shift, and found the tea-spoon; next morning the prisoner gave me two spoons herself.
I am a pawnbroker; this is my duplicate; a tea-spoon was pledged with me in the name of Foulkes on the 12th of May; the young man who took it in has left me, and I cannot say who pledged it.
I am an officer; I apprehended the prisoner, at No. 2, Webb-street, on the 18th of September, at night, upon suspicion of stealing a pair of ear-rings, and the spoons; she said, the ear-rings were given her, and as to the spoons, she knew nothing of them; I took her to the watch-house, where I left her. (The spoons were produced and identified.)
The prosecutrix lent me spoons at different times, and I pledged many things for her at different times, but I was not to pledge them in her name, least her husband should find it out; she used to get tipsey, and make me so, that I did not know what I did.
