I am a corn chandler . On Sunday the 21st of December, I was robbed from some part of my cart house; I found the sack with some oats in it, during the night.
Was the sack your's?
It was not.
Were the oats your's?
I believe it is a hard matter to swear to oats.
They were on your premises?
Yes.
How came they on your premises, was it a borrowed sack?
No, but it was on my premises, how it came there I cannot possibly tell.
Were these sacks of oats that you speak of, those that were found on the prisoner?
Yes, those that he took from the cart house.
Why do you believe that they belonged to you?
Because they are very much like the oats that I have; I have a great many sacks about my yard that are stray sacks.
Did you miss any oats from any place?
No, when I have two or three hundred bushels of oats shot down I cannot possibly miss any.
