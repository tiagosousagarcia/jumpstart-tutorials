I let a lodging to the prisoner, the 4th of August; she was to pay 2 s. 6 d. a week, furnished; she staid till the 12th; and when she went, the sheet and the table-cloth were gone; she gave me no notice; she left her room locked; in about three days I got into the room, and found the articles were gone.
I am a pawnbroker's servant; I produce a table-cloth, and an half-handkerchief; I took it in the 9th of August, but I cannot tell of whom; the duplicates are of my hand-writing.
I found the duplicate on the prisoner last Thursday; I am a constable.
It is the duplicate of a tablecloth and half-handkerchief.
I prevented the prisoner from making her escape from the officer; she attempted to strike him, and used him very ill.
I am not guilty; I never was in the pawnbroker's house in my life; I found the duplicate; I cannot read; and I gave it my landlord to read it.
