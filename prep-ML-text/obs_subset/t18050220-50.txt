I am a baker , I live in Charles-street, Shoreditch : On the 8th of February, between seven and eight o'clock in the evening, I heard the footstep of a person coming into the shop, I was in the bakehouse under the shop; I came up stairs, and heard some boys run; I followed them, and heard one of them say to the other, run, now is your time, come along; two of them ran back again towards the shop, and just as I came to the shop-door, on the pathway, the prisoner came out with a quartern loaf in his hand; I laid hold of him, and he dropped the loaf; I fetched an officer, and delivered the prisoner to him; we missed three loaves; I did not catch the other boy .
