I am an ironmonger , I live in Foster lane . On the 22nd of December, between three and four o'clock, I was up stairs at dinner; the young man in the shop came up to me and said, that a man in the shop had stole some goods from off the counter. I went down stairs, I turned the prisoner round, put my hand in his pocket, and took out a parcel containing the brass pulleys. I took him into the counting-house, left him in the custody of my brother, and turned the key upon him. He let fall the brass nobs from his other pocket while I was\\ send\\ ing for a constable.
I am shopman to Mr. Knight.
Has Mr. Knight any partners
Yes, his brother Richard. When John Lemmon came in the shop, there were about seven or eight customers in the shop, he did not ask for any thing, I suspected him; I saw him with a parcel of brass pulleys in his pocket. I informed my master of it. When he came he took the brass pullies out of his pocket.
The brass pullies belong to me, only the brass nobs belong to him; I beg for mercy.
