I am a waiter at the Thatched House Tavern; I lost a great coat on Sunday, I missed it about a quarter before one in the morning.
I saw the prisoner coming down stairs on the 30th of January, between the hours of twelve and one.
I saw the prisoner standing in the street, with a drab coloured coat under his arm; I went up to him and said, I believe you are the gentleman I want to speak with; he ran away; my suspicion was grounded on his having a great coat under his arm, and one on his back, and he ran away; I have kept this coat ever since.
I know nothing of this coat, Prosser owned it.
This is my coat, I will swear to it by the buttons being broke; I have no doubt at all of its being my coat.
I know nothing at all about the matter.
