I am a coal-merchant : On Sunday morning the 2d of January, between six and seven o'clock, the property was taken from my barge at my wharf, I had been frequently robbed, and desired a man to watch.
I am a watchman at Blackfriar's-bridge; on the 2d of this month, about six o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner go down the steps, another man went down just before, I was at the last house in Bridge-street; I then went to the Crescent, and called another watchman to assist me, the prisoner was the first man that came up with a bag upon his shoulder, I laid hold of him.
Could you see any thing they were doing?
No, I heard the coals rattle in the craft; I secured the prisoner, and found the bag contained coals, there was about a peck and a half.
I am a watchman; I saw the prisoner come up the steps, I assisted in securing him, he had a bag with some coals.
I was a constable at the time this happened; I took charge of the coals, I have had them ever since. (Produces them.)
There were no coals near that place but mine, or within one hundred yards of it; I missed the coals from a barge, No. 1003, it was full the night before.
I am a lighterman; I cannot swear to these coals, they are the same sort of coals that were lost, there was no other craft near, or a passage to any other, unless a man jumped overboard; the barge was called the Hope, No. 1003, and an anchor painted on her stern.
Was this a full room?
No, it was broken into the day before; there had been a great deal of rain in the night, which gives a different gloss to the coals, and these were taken after the rain left off; they had the appearance of having been raked out with the hands.
My wife had laid in that morning, and I had no coals to warm my three children; I went on board a sailing barge, and the man gave me some coals.
