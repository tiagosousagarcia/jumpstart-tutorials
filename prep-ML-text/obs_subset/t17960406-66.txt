I am a pewterer in Little New-street : On Friday the 4th of March, I lost two ingots of pewter from my manufactory; the prisoner was my porter ; the constable, George Streaton, searched him in my shop, it was found in his breeches, he had been in my employment a little more than a fortnight.
I am a constable, I was called upon by one of Mr. Joseph's servants, on the 4th of March, about nine in the evening; I went to Mr. Joseph's, I searched the prisoner, and found this pewter in his breeches, next his skin, (they are produced in Court).
I cannot swear to the ingots.
I am Journeyman to Mr. Joseph; these ingots are Mr. Joseph's property, they have my mark upon them, they were cast in our manfactory, they are in an unfinished state at present.
Did you put the marks upon them before they were stolen?
Yes; before they were lost, they were under the shop board among the sweepings and rubbish; I missed them just before nine o'clock.
