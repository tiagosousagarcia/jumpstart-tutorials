I am a watchman in the Steel-yard. On the 18th of June last, between one and two o'clock at noon, I was coming up the yard. I saw the prisoner walking to and fro. I asked, what he was walking there for? He said, was not the dinner-hour over? I saw him go and set himself down on the stairs beside the indigo-warehouse: he said he was going to take a sleep there: I left him. I had a wheel-barrow, and was cleaning the yard; and, as I came down, I saw him come out with something in his apron, and followed him as he was going out of the yard. I called out, Kirkham, you have got something out of the warehouse: he said, No, I have not. I felt his apron on the outside: he said he had got some coals. I felt again, and found it was indigo: he put it on the ground till Mr. Pearson came, and he took it up. Mr. Pearson charged a constable with him.
I was at dinner. Stubley called me, and said a man had got some indigo. I went and saw the indigo lie on the ground in the apron. The prisoner said he had found it.
I was out on business. When I came in, Mr. Pearson told me the warehouse had been robbed: we went to examine it. I had the key of one door in my pocket: there was another door with two bolts, which had been opened, and but one bolt was bolted again. I am sure I bolted both of them. There was a board broke, that a man might shove his hand in, and bolt one of the bolts. I can swear to the indigo; it is a particular sort.
I went into that place which is open to any body. I saw the bundle lying in the dog-kennel, and I took it up: I was not in the warehouse.
The indigo was loose in his apron.
