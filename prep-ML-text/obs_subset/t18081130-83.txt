I am a printseller in Oxford street.
What is the prisoner
A broker . On the 6th of August these goods were delivered to Mr. Riveer, for him to deliver them to Mr. Coarts to send them to Holland.
I am a pawnbroker. On the 16th and 17th of September Samuel Diot pledged the books of prints in the name of Hendrix.
I am an officer. I found these books on the 1st of October at Lee's shop.
I was clerk in the house of Joseph Coart . I was ordered to take these books and pawn them by the prisoner.
On the 5th of August Mr. Coligne told me he had some books to send to Holland, he gave me seven parcels; I took them to Mr. Coart's, he gave me a receipt for them. I saw the parcel packed up; I do not know the contents.
These are only part of the seven parcels that have been found; I have been searching two months for them.
The goods that I sent Diot to pledge I received them from captain Debay; he was discharged by the magistrate; I was first arrested for debt, and discharged for this felony, and after that I was detained.
