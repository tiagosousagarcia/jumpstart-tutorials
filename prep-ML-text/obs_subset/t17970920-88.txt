- I am a publican ; I keep the Best, in Church-row, Aldgate : On the 14th of August I was called up between five and six o'clock in the morning; the prisoner lodged in my house; when I came down, Mr. Layton and he were both standing in the passage together; the prisoner said, Mrs. Curtis, forgive me, I never was in the bar before; I told him that I had suffered too much; I went out and fetched a constable; he came with me, and searched him, and took from him eighteen pennyworth of halfpence that he had taken out of the bar, and he took him into custody.
- I am a carpenter; I set up all night on Sunday evening to watch the bar; we suspected that somebody stole the pots in the night; and about a quarter after five on the Monday morning the prisoner came down; I saw him go into the bar; when he was coming out again, I jumped up from where I was sitting, and said, oh, I have got you at last; he begged of me to let him go, and I told him I would not; I had a rattle in one hand, and a sword in the other; I sprung the rattle, and one of the lodgers came down; I did not see him go to the till, the bar was dark, and he shut the door after him when he went in, but he had the halfpence in his hand when he came out; I had marked six pennyworth of halfpence the night before; they were marked the last thing; and among those that he had in his hand, were three I had marked; I went to the till afterwards, and found the remainder of the six pennyworth in the till; I delivered them to the constable.
- I am a constable.
These are three of the halfpence that I marked; here is the punch that I marked them with.
I had affronted Mr. Layton, and he said he would lay a snare for me, and would do for me; and when I came down on Monday morning, he laid hold of me, and said, I had been robbing the till.
