About a month ago, I went to Somerset house to receive my wages; in Drury-lane, I saw the prisoner about twelve o'clock at night; I asked her for a lodging; she asked me if I wanted a wife; I told her, no; there was another girl with her, they asked me to treat them, I gave them a shilling; this girl stayed in the room with me, she shut the door; I went down stairs, the prisoner went with me, with a candle; she blowed out the candle, and then three men laid hold of me, and took what I had from me, a five pound note and a ten pound note; I have never found my notes again.
