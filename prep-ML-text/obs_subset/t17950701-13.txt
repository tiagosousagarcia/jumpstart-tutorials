I am a coachman to Lord Chancellor. I was in Charlotte-street, Bedford-square , I was on foot, going down the street, on Friday, the 5th of June, about twenty minutes, or twenty five minutes after six o'clock in the evening; I see the prisoner setting behind the carriage of Mr. Edward's, and taking hold of a coat.
Where was the coat?
Hanging on the holders, behind the carriage.
A man's cloth great coat, was it?
Yes. When he perceived that I noticed him behind the carriage, he got from behind the carriage, and went to some little distance from it; in about a minute and a half after, I was in the same street, when I see him get up again, he for there till I went about a quarter of a mile, and I came round to the corner, and he was behind the carriage still, and he had pulled the coat over his arm, and at last he pulled it quite over his arm, and he went off with it.
Then you left him for some little time?
Yes.
Did you pursue him?
Yes, and I took hold of his collar, and took him.
Had he the coat on him when you took him?
Yes, on his arm; Mr. Edwards's coachman was sitting on the box, and I called to him, and he came and took the coat, and took care of the man.
In what street was it in?
I came back to Charlotte-street.
You are coachman to Mr. Edwards?
Yes, Mr. Bryan Edwards; the Lord Chancellor's coachman called to me, and I jumped off my box, and took the coat, the coat was between them both, the coachman and the prisoner.
It was on the prisoner at the time?
Yes, it was.
Whose coat was it?
The footman's, he is ill in the country, and could not come up.
Was it a livery coat?
Yes.
You know it by the colour of it to be the footman's coat?
Yes, I marked it; it has been locked up in our master's house, in town, ever since.
Did you know it was in the holders that day?
Yes, I see him bring it out, when he came out of the house.
I have nothing to say.
