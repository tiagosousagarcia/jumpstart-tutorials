I am a sheriff's officer , I was going along Cannon Street on Tuesday last, about three o'clock, I was informed my pocket was picked, and I went up to the prisoner, seized him; and took it from under his coat. (Produced, and deposed to.)
there was a young man in a green coat, that dropped it and I picked it up, and that man came.
