You are clerk to the solicitor of the mint.
Yes.
You produce the copy of the record of the conviction of the prisoner.
I do, I got it from the office of the county of Middlesex, I examined it with the original record. (The copy of the record of the conviction of the prisoner read in court.)
You are an officer belonging to Marlborough street.
Yes.
Were you present when the prisoner was convicted.
Yes, I was at Clerkenwell in April 1805, at the sessions there
Are you sure of her person.
I am sure of her person, I have known her many years.
You heard the trial.
I did.
Did you hear what it was for.
I did; I had some halfpence to produce which she had about her at the time she uttered the bad sixpence.
I believe your husband keeps a public house.
He does, at No. 23, Poland street, Oxford street.
Do you know the prisoner.
Yes.
Do you remember her coming to you.
Yes.
On what day was it.
On Monday the 26th of May.
At what time did she come to your house.
A quarter before twelve at noon; she asked for half a-pint of porter, it came to a penny farthing, she tendered me a sixpence, I looked at it, I did not discover it was a bad one at that time, I put it in my pocket.
What had you in your pocket that you put the sixpence into.
I had a seven shilling piece and a half guinea only.
Are you sure you had no silver.
I had not.
How soon after you had put the sixpence into your pocket did you see the witness Foy.
It was within a moment, I was going to go up the stairs, but had not got up the stairs.
When Foy came in did you shew Foy the sixpence that you had received from the prisoner.
Yes.
Had you any suspicion of it before you shewed it to him.
No, he asked me what the lady gave for the porter, I told him.
He asked you to shew him the sixpence.
Yes, I produced the sixpence to him in a moment.
And then you found it to be a counterfeit one.
Yes.
Did you keep the sixpence.
Yes, I kept it till three o'clock in the afternoon, by itself wrapped up in paper.
Foy went out of the house to apprehend the prisoner.
Yes.
At three o'clock in the afternoon what did you do with the sixpence then.
I gave it to Foy at Marlborough-street.
Then the prisoner in the mean time had been apprehended, and you attended at Marlborough-street.
Yes.
You are quite sure that the same sixpence that you received from the prisoner was the same sixpence that you gave to Foy at Marlborough-street.
I am quite sure of that.
Did you know the prisoner before.
No.
Have you any doubt of her being the person.
No, I was with her half an hour in Marlborough-street, I am sure she is the same person.
I am an officer of Marlborough-street.
How long have you known the prisoner.
About four years.
Did you on this day that we have been speaking of, see the prisoner any where.
In Portland-street, St. James's, Westminster, about twelve o'clock in the day; I suspected her, and followed her into Poland-street, she stopped at the corner of Poland-street, in Oxford-street, and put something in her pocket and took something out.
She was putting her hands in her pocket.
Yes, for about half a minute, and then walked on again, she turned into the sign of the King's Arms, in Poland-street, at Mr. Brown's, I staid out till she came out, and then I went in and enquired what she had changed there. Mrs. Brown produced this sixpence, she said this sixpence was the sixpence that she had paid her. I produce the sixpence. I rubbed the sixpence on the stairs with my foot, to ascertain whether it was a bad one, and marked it, and desired her to keep it by itself; I then followed the prisoner, and took her in custody, in Marlborough-street, close by the office; she immediately put her hand and took out this brown paper, I suspected she was going to throw it away, I immediately seized both her hands, and took her into the office, where after some time struggling, we got the paper out of her hand, I found it contained two more sixpences, which I now produce, I have had them ever since; I searched her, and found a red pocket book, a new tooth brush, and about thirteen pennyworth of new halfpence, here is six pennyworth of them, and Jackson has got the rest, they were all good copper; we had some discourse who gave charge of her, she said if I liked she need not be prosecuted, I told her it did not rest with me, it was with the gentlemen who conducted the mint, I should take her before the magistrate; at the office I received that sixpence of Mrs. Brown, I have had it ever since; I was in court at Clerkenwell when sentence was passed upon her.
You are one of the moniers of his Majesty's mint,
I am.
I will trouble you to look at this sixpence, tell me whether that is good or counterfeited.
It is counterfeited, the other two sixpence are also counterfeited, they are mixed with metal, and the brass is to be seen on one of them, they are none of them silver.
I beg for mercy.
