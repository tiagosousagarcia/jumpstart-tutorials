I live at the seven dials; I keep a linen draper's shop ; I lost seventeen cotton and linen handkerchiefs; on Monday the 9th of April; at about four in the afternoon, two women came into my shop; about eight in the evening, they both returned, and told me they had paid me sixpence too much; I convinced them of the mistake; they had no sooner got out of the door, but some person opened the door, and said, they had robbed me; I immediately stepped out, and the other woman having a child, I concluded this was the person that had the property; accordingly I took her with the seventeen handkerchiefs upon her; she had them and whisked them altogether, and clapped them under her cloak under her arm.
I am not guilty; as I was coming out of the shop, with my landlady, a woman came in by the side of me and catched them off, and dropped them down by the side of me in the street.
When are you to be brought to bed?
I do not know that I have a minute to go.
