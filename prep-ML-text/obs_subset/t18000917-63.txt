I drive an errand-cart : On Saturday the 26th of July last, as my cart was standing in Paternoster-row , a little after three o'clock in the afternoon, I saw a man come up and take a parcel out of the cart, and go up Paternoster-row; I followed him, and took him, I never lost sight of him; he threw the parcel down before I came up to him, I took him in Lovell-court; he made a desperate resistance before the constable came, he kicked me several times while I had hold of him; he threw the parcel down as he turned the corner of Lovell-court; I took it up immediately and followed him, I gave it to the constable, I do not know what it contains.
I am an officer, I took charge of the prisoner and the property; I received it from Mr. Bell, and have had it ever since. (Produces it.)
I am shopman to a linen-draper; I delivered this parcel to Mr. Bell's errand-cart myself, on Saturday, the 26th of July, it contains seven yards of cotton, and ten shawls; I directed the parcel myself to William Archbutt , at Brentford.
I have nothing to say.
