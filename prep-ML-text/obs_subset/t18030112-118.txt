sworn - I am a farmer at Harrow, the prisoner is a labourer ; I lost some elm boards, which I saw at the saw pit on the waste land; I got a search warrant, on the 31st of December, and went with the constable and James Fitzgerald, to the prisoner's house, and in the oven I found seven pieces of new quartering, one which was damaged matched with the other.(The pieces produced.)
Was the prisoner at home?
No.
I went with Mr. Foster to the prisoner's, and found three pieces of elm board hid under some furze up stairs, which I lost from my saw-pit.
I leave my defence to my counsel.
