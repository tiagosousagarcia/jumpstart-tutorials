I am a copper smith : I do no know any thing of the transaction.
How old are you?
Fifteen: On Saturday, the 17th of June, the prisoner came to our house between twelve and one, and wanted a copper of about sixty gallons, he then wanted the particulars; while I was in the accompting-house, writing them, I saw him put something into his apron, he then went to the shop door, I followed him, and asked him what he had got there, he said, nothing of your's, and that he would show me, he opened his apron, and there was a brass cock, (produces it) ; I have had it in my desk ever since.
He did not offer to run away?
No, he was upon crutches; he waited till I got Tipper, the beadle, he begged for mercy, cried, and wished he had been dead before he came into the shop.
I went to ask for a copper, with a large cock, and this cock was lying upon the copper; I took it up in my hand, as I might any thing else, and in a few minutes he turned about, and said, that is what you are about, is it? he said he would send for a constable, and he had me insulted by the people, till I could searce stand upon my legs.
What was the price of the copper he asked for?
About five pounds; it was a second-hand one that I shewed him, the cock was tied round by the top in his apron.
