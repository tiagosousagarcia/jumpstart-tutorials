- My partner, John Summers , and myself, are tailors , No. 415, in the Strand : On the 22d of December, about eight o'clock in the evening, two young men came into the shop, and asked me if I had a waistcoat like that which one had on; I told them, no, and they went out, leaving the door open; I went round to shut it, and immediately a constable brought the coat and prisoner in.
Was the prisoner one of the young men who had been in the shop?
No; the coat was made for a gentleman in St. Paul's Church yard; I had seen it about half past seven, for I put it down on a desk about two yards from the door; no other person had been in the shop but those two young men that I saw.
I am a constable of St. Martin's: On the 22d of December, as I was going down the Strand, about a quarter past eight, I saw the prisoner and a boy together, which excited my suspicion; they were about five yards from Mr. Summers's shop-door when I first saw them; I immediately caught the prisoner by the collar, and the boy run off as hard as he could; I then took the prisoner back to Mr. Prosser's.
Had you seen him come out?
No; seeing him so close to their shop with a great coat on his arm, I suspected him; as I was going into the door two young men rushed past me; directly I thought they were the two partners, or I should have stopped them.
Did you see the boy deliver it to the prisoner?
No; I saw it on the prisoner's arm.
It was after you had taken the prisoner that the two men came out?
Yes; I thought they were the partners alarmed at the robbery, and running after the thief.
I had been of an errand, and a lad came up and asked me if I wanted to buy a great coat; I said, let me look at it, and I carried it four or five yards to a window to look at it, and that man took me back into the shop.
