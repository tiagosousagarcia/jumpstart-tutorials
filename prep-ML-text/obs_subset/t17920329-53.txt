On the 12th of March, between twelve and one at night, I met the prisoner in Holborn, as I was going home; she took hold of my arm and asked me to go home with her? I said, no, I was going home; she kept hold of my arm, and would walk with me; in a little while I found her hand down at my pocket, and the bottom of my pocket up at the top: I lost two half crowns and four shillings.
I was coming down Holborn, and going home, the man caught me and took me under a gateway; I told him I did not like that; he asked me to drink a glass with him; I, being an unfortunate girl, I went with; then he called a watchman, and said I had robbed him; I had five shillings in my pocket; he sent this paper to me.
Court to prosecutor. Where had you been?
With an acquaintance.
Are you a married man?
No.
Did you send that paper?
No; I never saw it before.
Are you sure?
Yes.
Did you never send her any message?
No, I never did.
I cannot tell who brought it.
I am a patrol. I was coming down Holborn on the 12th of March, between twelve and one: I saw this man and that woman stand at the end of Feather's-court, in Holborn; and coming back I saw them going down the court; they were close together; he had hold of her; I heard him say, if she would not give him the money she took he would charge the watch; I took two half crowns and four shillings out of her hands; she swore going up Holborn she had no money about her.
