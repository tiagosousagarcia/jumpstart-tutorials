I produce a copy of the conviction of the prisoner.
Where did you get it from
From Mr. Shelton.
Have you compared it
Yes. (The copy of the record read)
Did you apprehend the prisoner
I can prove nothing more than the prisoner being at large on the 19th of November; he was brought to the office upon another charge.
Was he at large before he was brought there
I saw him at large before he was brought into the office; he was at large before he was taken.
Did you see him at large before he was taken
I did not see that.
Then he was in custody when you saw him
Yes.
Do you know the prisoner at the bar
Yes.
Was he the same man that was convicted
Yes, in September sessions.
Do you know whether he had any pardon granted him
Yes, I have got it in my hand. (The pardon read.)
Here is a note of his being enlisted at the bottom of the pardon.
