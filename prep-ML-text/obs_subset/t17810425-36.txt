I lost a piece of Manchester striped cotton from my shop on the 23d of March.
I get my bread in the street; I saw the prisoner go by Mr. Eyre's bulk ten or twelve times, at about three o'clock in the afternoon; it was five weeks ago yesterday; this piece of cotton was by a piece of carpeting upon the bulk of the window; at last I saw her draw it round, and take it off the bulk, and put it into a straw basket she had in her hand; and then she set off with it; I ran and took her when she had got about fifty yards from the place; I asked her, What she had there? She said, Nothing. I said, she had got some property of Mr. Eyre's; she refused letting me look inside her cloak; I took her back to Mr. Eyre, with the piece of cotton.
There is no particular mark upon it, but I know I had such a piece upon the bulk, which was missing.
I was coming by, and saw it lying on the pavement.
