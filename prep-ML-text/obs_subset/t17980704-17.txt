I keep the Angel, in the City-road : On the 17th of June, the prisoner came in with another man and called for a pint of porter; he took an opportunity of going up stairs, he came down again, and went out; and in consequence of what my girl told me, I went after him, and told him he must come back; then he ran away, and I pursued him, and took him; when I brought him back, I missed my watch.
On the 17th of June, the prisoner was brought back into the parlour; while the constable was gone for, I saw the watch in his hand under his coat, and a gentleman who was in the room, immediately took it from him. The officer has the watch.
I took the watch out of his hand, and gave it to Mr. Mann.( John Burland , the officer, produced the watch, which was deposed to by the prosecutor).
Where was the watch before it was lost?
It hung at the bed's head, up two pair of stairs.
