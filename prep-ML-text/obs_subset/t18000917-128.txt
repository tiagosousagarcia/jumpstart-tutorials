On the 26th of August, I heard a noise in the shop; I looked and missed a pair of stockings; the prisoner was brought back with them.
On the 26th of August, I was passing up Piccadilly; I saw the prosecutor run across the road; I pursued two boys(the prisoner was one) into Marlborough-Street; I took the prisoner to the public-house, opposite the office, searched him, and found this pair of stockings in his breeches.
These are my stockings.
I picked up the stockings on the ground, in Piccadilly; I am an American; the ship went away without me; I have been twice sick in St. Giles's workhouse.
