I live No. 82, Wheeler-street. On Friday, the 16th of March, my wife and me went out between seven and eight, and returned a little past eight; when we came back we found the street door open; it was shut, latched, when we went out, but not locked; the prisoner was in the house with the property; I laid hold of him directly in the room, and the property was at his feet, all removed from the place where they had been left; they were the things in the indictment.
I am wife to the last witness. I came in first, and there was the prisoner; I called to my husband, and he stopped him; I latched the street door; there was no proper lock to it.
