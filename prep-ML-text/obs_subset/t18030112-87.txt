You are a surgeon?
I am.
Did you examine the body of Elizabeth Hurdle ?
I did, the second day after her death.
Are you able to form a judgment of what was the cause of her death?
She died of an inflammation of the lungs and heart.
Can you judge what was the cause of it?
There waas not any marks externally to induce me to say violence was the cause of it.
How long had the inflammation existed?
I don't think it could have existed more than twelve or fourteen hours.
Would beating and ill usage produce that inflammation?
There are various causes.
Is that a cause to which you can ascribe inflammation?
Beating and bruising will occation inflammation, but there was not any external appearance at that time to make me believe it was occasioned by violence, and had I opened the body without hearing the rumour, I should not have supposed it had been occasioned by violence.
was it that sort of instammation that might be occasioned by drinking?
The very frequent use of strong spirituous liquors might produce a strong inflammation; this was more violent than any I ever saw.
You should not have suspected any violence from the appearnace of the body?
I did not see any thing to induce me to suspect any.
was there that appearance about the body to lead you to accunt for the infalmmation by violence?
no; I can only say that violence, such as is reported to have been used upon the body, would produce such disease.
But would it not leave some external mark?
Yes; but there was not the least vestige of a bruise or contusion; I cannot pretend to say what squeezing or pressing might do, but blows or kicks must leave some marks.
You say it could not without marks of violence; but squeezing, such as you have stated, might do it?
I think pressure might do it, but I cannot say what the cause of it was.
Are you a married woman?
Yes; my husband is a groom; the prisoner is a chip hat weaver. On a Friday evening, in December, I cannot tell what day of the month, about five o'clock, I went to the prisoner's apartment and found him lying on the bed in liquor, and the deceased was smoaking her pipe by the fire. Her name was Elizabeth Hurdle ; she was also in liquor. I went there to speak to Mrs. Lilly, and she was not at home; when I had been there about ten minutes, I asked the deceased wehre Mrs. Lilly was, and she said she did not know; she expected her in every minute, and I sat down to wait for her. The deceased said to the prisoner, you dog you have hooked my child many a time, and now I will hook you.
What did she mean by hooked?
He works with a hook at his business. She then began to scratch his face. She had been sitting by the fire side; she got up and went to the bed; I went to him, and held him down for fear he should strike her. I held him down while she scratched his face. During that time his wife came in; she was in liquor.
How long did you hold him down?
I dare say about ten minutes.
Why did you not take the woman off?
She was so obstreperous she would not be persuaded by me; then the wife came in, and she began to scratch his face as well as her sister; they were both so obstinate they would not go out.
Why did the wife scratch him?
She thought he was ill using her sister, which was the deceased. I went and fetched in Mary Clarke; I was not gone above three or four minutes, and when I came back the deceased was on the floor; the prisoner was standing on her left hand.
Had he shoes on?
No.
What was he doing?
He was standing still.
Where was his wife?
She was standing in the room.
You saw no blows?
No.
