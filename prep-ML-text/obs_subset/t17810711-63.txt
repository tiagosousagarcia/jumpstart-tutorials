I went home with the prisoner, and another girl, to the prisoner's lodgings. She took the things mentioned in the indictment (repeating them) I did not feel her take the stock, but I felt her take the glass out of my pocket, and made her give me that again. I felt her take my handkerchief, and took it from her; I never got my stock and stockbuckle again: I asked her for them; she swore she had not got them, that she knew nothing of them; I went away with the other woman to seek after the stock.
Had she been out of the room before you missed the stock?
Yes; she went down; there was nobody but her with me; the other girl was at the other side of the room with Anderson: the third girl came up after I had lost my stock.
I was in the room; I did not see the girl take any things from him: there was no other girl with him but the prisoner.
I never saw the man till he came on Monday morning: they said I was one of the girls that robbed him.
