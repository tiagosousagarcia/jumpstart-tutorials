I am an Excise watchman, at Chester-quay ; I had charge of sixteen bags of coffee, on the 20th of October; I saw the prisoner cut one of the bags, and caught him putting some of it in his hat, and some in his pocket; I called Mr. Smith, an officer, to my assistance, and gave charge of the prisoner and the coffee; it was about one o'clock in the day; the prisoner worked on the quays.
I took charge of the prisoner and the coffee; there is about three pounds of it.
I throw myself on your Lordship's mercy.
