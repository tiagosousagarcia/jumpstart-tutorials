I am parish-clerk of the parish of the collegiate church of Christ, in Manchester: this is the original marriage entries,
\"widow, married by banns.\" It is regularly entred, and subscribed by the parties; I was present; dated 29th November 1789.
I am parish clerk of the parish of St. Andrew Holborn: Thomas Parkinson , of the parish of St. Andrew Holborn, bachelor, and Catherine Burns , spinster , were married in this church by licence, the 15th day of September 1791; I have attested the marriage, the prisoner is the same man that was married, by that name, at our church.
I was present, when the prisoner was accused of having a wife; he denied it: this copy of a certificate was produced by the first wife, she gave it to me: he at last said, if the truth must come out, you knew when I married you I had a wife and four children; he acknowledged to the first wife.
I was married to the prisoner at the bar in September; he declared he was a single man: I was married on the Thursday, on the following Monday I discovered he had been married before, it was said to two other women.
When I was living in Manchester, I married this woman; I found she had another husband living; I found a letter in her pocket from her husband she eloped from him; therefore I thought I had a right to marry again.
