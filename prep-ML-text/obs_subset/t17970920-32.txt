Sworn. - I am the wife of Simon Stillman ; I live with a perfumer in Fleet-street : On the 14th of August I was employed by my landlady to clean the first floor; I live in the second floor; my landlord's name is Boss; he inhabits the ground floor; I left my room, and returned to it in about five minutes; I found my room door open, which alarmed me very much; a little while after, I thought I heard a noise in the room, and I looked and saw the prisoner under the Bed; I went out of the room and locked him in; I ran down stairs directly; I came down stairs and gave the alarm, and Mr. Barwell came up; we went up stairs, and found the prisoner concealed in a closet; Mr. Barwell secured him; I went to a chest that is in the bed-room, and found a coat, waistcoat, and two pair of breeches taken out, and dropped in again, as if he had been disturbed by my coming up into the room; there was one coat which was at the bottom of the chest, I found at the top; my black silk cloak I did not miss till five o'clock in the afternoon; upon missing it, I looked about and found it tied up in a strange pocket-handkerchief under the bed.
- I was at the street-door, and heard the woman call stop thief; I asked where they were; and she said, they were up stairs; I went up stairs, and found him secreted in a closet; I secured him, and delivered him to the constable.
