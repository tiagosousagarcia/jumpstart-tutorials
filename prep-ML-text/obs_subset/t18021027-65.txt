I packed up the property, and directed it to William Pennington, at Kendall, there might be fifty, I suppose; they were to go by the Manchester mail, from the Crosskeys-inn, Wood-street ; I have seen the same parcel at the Mansion-house.
I am bookkeeper , at the Cross-keys; I remember receiving a parcel, directed to Mr. Pennington, of Kendall, on the 1st of September, at the coach-office, it was booked to go by the Manchester Telegraph; I put a mark, No. 70, on it, it did not go by the coach, because it was not brought in time; it was put into the office and remained till about half past eight in the evening, when it stood on the counter with many other parcels, to go to the White-horse, in Fetter-lane; I was making out a bill, and I heard a parcel moved off the counter; I said, there was a parcel gone, and Joseph Taylor went out after the person; in about five minutes, he brought the parcel and the prisoner back, the parcel was the same as had been left.
I am a porter: On the 1st of September, I saw the prisoner go out of the door with the parcel, I followed him, and overtook him before he got out of the yard; I had laid the parcel on the counter, and seeing it under his arm, I laid hold of it, and called for assistance; I got him back, and the parcel was the same I had put on the counter; we sent for the City-marshal, and delivered it to him.
I am one of the the City-marshals, and produce the parcel; I took the prisoner into custody, and he said, it was distress drove him to it.
I have nothing to say, I leave myself to the mercy of the Court.
