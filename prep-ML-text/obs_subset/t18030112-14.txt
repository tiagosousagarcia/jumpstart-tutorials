On Friday the 31st of December, at a quarter before seven o'clock at night, I saw the prisoner draw a ribbon through the screw-hole of West and Spragge's window; I ran from behind the counter in pursuit of him; he ran across the road; I overtook him, and pushed him down; he jumped up, and ran away; I did not see him again till Wednesday the 5th of January; he was brought to our house by an officer; I knew him again; I have no doubt about his person in the least.
Who do you live with?
Thomas West and Matthew Spragge , No. 60, Whitechapel-road ; it was a plaid ribbon.
I live servant at the Black Bull, Whitechapel-road; the last night in the year the prisoner gave me a bit of ribbon, between eight and nine o'clock in the evening; I wore it the next day, till the officer had it from me, I believe the next day.
- I am an officer (produces a piece of ribbon) I had this from the last witness; on Wednesday the 5th of January, in consequence of information, I went to this public-house, where there were a great number of these loose kind of lads, and the girl pointed out the prisoner among them; he said he bought it in Rag-fair for nine-pence.
This is the same pattern as the ribbon I saw the prisoner take; there were upwards of twelve yards lost; this is about a yard.
I bought it in Rosemary-lane of a woman that sits there and sells garters and ribbons and other things, and this girl asked me to give it to her, which I did.
