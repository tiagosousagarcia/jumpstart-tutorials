The prisoner was a servant in my house, he slept in a detached adjoining back part of the premises, he had only been in my service from the Friday preceding, (I can swear to the property.)
I am an officer of Bishopsgate-ward-without, on Sunday the 31st of January, about half-past eleven, I went to the Compter with a prisoner, when I came back to the watch-house, the prisoner at the bar was in custody, that was about half-past twelve, at night; I took the prisoner to the Compter, and before I got to Bartholomew-lane, I heard something gingle in his pocket, I enquired what it was, and he said, two keys; I told him, I must have these keys, he said, he would give them to me at the Compter; when we got to the corner of the Bank, he gave us the slip and ran; we pursued him into Coleman-street, and he was taken by the assistance of the watchmen; I took him to the Compter, with the keys; Mr. Vernon has got the keys, he could not get into the premises without them.
What do you know?
About half after twelve o'clock at night, the prisoner was coming by the watch-house, and dropped a bundle; the watchman laid hold of him, and I took up the bundle; I opened it, and found two or three coats, a gown-piece, and different articles, made and unmade; I asked him, if he was a tailor, he said, he was; he told me, one great-coat was for the coachman, at the Swan, Bishopsgate-street; I said, is it possible your master could trust you with so much property at once, it will take you, I am sure, a month to make them; he dropped them at the door of the watch-house.
I believe you had entrusted the prisoner to go to your banker's, and found him faithful so far?
Yes.
I am a watchman of Bishopsgate-within; I saw the prisoner coming past the end of Wormwood-street, at half-past twelve o'clock at night, near the watch-house, he had a green bag upon his shoulder; I asked him where he brought it from; he said, from his master's, that he was a journeyman-tailor; I said, it was very odd he should have such a bundle at so late an hour, and took him into the watch-house; I examined the bag, these are the same articles.
