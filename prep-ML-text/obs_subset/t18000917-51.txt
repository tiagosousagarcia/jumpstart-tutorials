I am a stable-keeper , in partnership with George Clarke , at Cripplegate : I can only prove the property.
I am a coachman: I cannot say what day it was, but I stopped the prisoner coming out of the yard, with the bridle; in consequence of information I received from a lad who is here, I stopped him, and took the bridle out of his breeches; I delivered the man and the bridle to the constable.
What age are you?
Going of eleven.
Do you know what will become of you if you tell a lie, or swear that which is false?
I shall go to hell. (He is sworn).
I look after chaises and horses for Mr. Clarke: Sometime at the end of last month, I saw the prisoner take the bridle off the nail in the stable, lap it up, and put it into his breeches; he followed me up the stable, saw me speak to the coachman, and then he went out towards the street; he had not got quite out of the yard when the coachman laid hold of him, and took the bridle from him; it was Mr. Clarke's bridle; the prisoner and the bridle were delivered to the constable.
I am ostler to Mr. Clarke's livery stables: I know the bridle to be Mr. Clarke's. (The constable produced the bridle, which was deposed to by the prosecutor and the ostler).
I was very much fuddled; I do not know any thing of the bridle.
