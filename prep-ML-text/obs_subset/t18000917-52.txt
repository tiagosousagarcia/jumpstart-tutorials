I am a carman : On Wednesday the 6th of August, the prisoner worked a cart for me; he did a load of wine from Towerdock to Cornhill, as I was informed by a witness in Court, and he never gave me any account of it; I did not discover it till, I think it was, Saturday the 23d; when the prisoner came home on the Wednesday night, the 6th, I discharged him, because I accused him of having done more than he had given me an account of; he told me, if I would tell him what it was he would give me the money, but if I could not he would not; he gave me an account that day of four loads paid for, and two half loads paid for; and two loads that were not paid for, which I have received the money for since.
Are you sure that none of those loads include this load of wine?
No; it is not in the book; I have received all the money that is in the book; he has entered in the book every place that the loads went to but not this.
I am a master carman: The prisoner and I went with two loads of wine, and he unloaded first, in Cornhill, at Tarle and Harper's; he drove Mr. Allen's cart, his name was upon it; he went up to receive his money and be could not give change, and he asked me to take his money; I received seven shillings; and I saw him afterwards in Thames-street, and gave him three shillings and sixpence, his share, for Mr. Allen his master.
I am a constable: I know nothing more than apprehending the prisoner.
The prisoner did not come to work the remainder of the week, and the Tuesday after he summoned me for his money.
I received three shillings and sixpence of that gentleman, and when I came home my master was not at home, and I gave my mistress the money; I gave her seventeen shillings and four-pence in all.
Is it true that the prisoner paid you seventeen shillings and fourpence upon this Wednesday, the 6th of August?
No; I did not settle with him at all that night
Did he at any time afterwards?
No; he always settled with my husband.
