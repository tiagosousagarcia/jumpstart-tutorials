On the 17th of last month, on Monday morning, I got up and went to my work, and left the prisoner in bed in my room; the prisoner lodged in the same house with me in Feather's-court, Holborn ; on Monday morning I took my coat and waistcoat from a line and put them in a chest, the rest of the things lay about the room, and my hat hung on the corner of the bedstead; James Hayes lodged in the same house, and went to work with me; I left the prisoner and Joseph Bowman in bed in the same room; about eight o'clock in the morning I was informed by James Hayes and Christopher Doyle that the room was robbed, and in about half an hour I heard the prisoner was taken; I went to my lodgings, and missed the things in the indictment.
I lodged with the prosecutors and prisoner the 27th of January, Patrick Doran and James Hayes went out first, I went out a quarter before seven, I am a whitesmith, I left the prisoner in the room part dressed: when I came home to breakfast, I heard the prisoner was in Bow-street, and the things stolen; me and the woman of the house went to Bow-street; I lost a cloth coat which I left on a little table alongside the bed; I left a pair of stockings, a shirt, and a handkerchief; they were not locked up.
The prisoner lodged on the Saturday night in our house, I did not lodge in the room the night the things were taken, I was on duty as supernumerary watchman; on the Monday morning I was informed the room was robbed, and all the men's clothes were gone; I overtook the prisoner with a small bundle, and this waistcoat sticking out of the bundle under his arm; I took him to Bow-street, I found nothing of these things but this waistcoat, which belongs to Doran; I saw him searched at the office, and half a guinea and six shillings were found in his pocket, and two gloves, and some duplicates.
I am a journeyman hatter on Ludgate-hill; the prisoner brought this hat to me to alter for him, and make less; to the best of my knowledge it was the prisoner.
On the 17th of January the prisoner brought a bundle about a quarter after eight in the morning; to the best of my knowledge it was him, but I cannot swear positively, to my house, a publick-house in Smithfield; I never saw him after till I was sent for to Sir Sampson's.
On the 17th of January, the morning part, these young men brought the prisoner to Bow-street, and I searched him, I found sixteen shillings and sixpence in money, two odd gloves, and a new under waistcoat, a few duplicates, but not concerning this robbery.
I live with Messrs. Pharez and Pearson of Fleet-market, pawn-brokers; I saw the prisoner on the 17th of January, to the best of my knowledge, I believe he is the man, he pledged a couple of coats and a handkerchief with me for one pound; I do not mean to swear positively to him, I believe it to be the man, to the best of my knowledge.
I took none of the things out of the lodgings; the waistcoat and gloves were given to me by a person that came to call me up in the morning, and he gave me the waistcoat to take home to my mother to wash with my things, but the waistcoat was not tied up in a bundle, and I was carrying home my dirty linen.
