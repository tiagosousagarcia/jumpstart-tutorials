I keep a chandler's shop in Shoe-lane ; the prisoner was my servant ; on Sunday morning, the 11th of August, I missed a coat and waistcoat which hung in the shop where the prisoner lay; he absconded, and he was found again on the 19th in Parker's-lane, Drury-lane.
I was present when this man was taken, and the coat was found upon him, it has been in Mr. Radenhurst's possession ever since; it is the same as deposed to by the prosecutor; the prisoner had it on, and confessed in the court before divers witnesses that he had taken divers other things.
The prosecutor gave them to me, and I was to have five guineas a year, and meat, drink, washing and lodging.
There is no agreement at all; I hired him, the watchman brought him to me for charity at twelve o'clock at night, I took him in, and went and brought him a shirt, he was very foul and lousy; I gave him a black coat.
