I am ostler to Henry Carr , who keeps livery-stables , the prisoner was servant to Mr. Carr five or six years back: On Saturday, the 13th of September, about two o'clock, the prisoner came into the yard, and asked me for work, I told him I had no employment for him; he stopped in the yard for an hour, or more than that; he went into a six-stall stable, facing the front gates; he was in these while I was harnessing a horse; my little boy, about 11 years old, was in the stable with me, his name is William; I saw the saddle that was lost, while I was harnessing the house after he was gone, I missed the saddle; I looked about for him, but I could not find him; the saddle belonged to a gentleman that had a horse standing as livery there; I saw it again the next day at the salder's, Charles Roberts's.
I am a sadler: The prisoner brought a saddle to me last Saturday week, No. 33, Portland-street, Wardour-street, about five o'clock; he said it belonged to a friend of his; he left it; I was not at home when the saddle was taken away by the officers.
I am an officer belonging to Marlborough-street: On Sunday, the 14th, the prosecutor Barnes, informed me he had lost a saddle, in consequence of which, I went and apprehended the prisoner in St. Giles's; we found him lying upon the bed with his clothes on, by the side of a woman; he told me where the saddle was; I went to Roberts's, where I found the saddle.
You do not find that sort of open conduct in old offenders?
No.
I am certain it is the same saddle.
I have nothing to say.
