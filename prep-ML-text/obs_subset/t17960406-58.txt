I don't know any thing of the robbery myself.
I am servant to Mr. Chipperfield; last Thursday I lost a loaf from my basket in the street in Whitechapel; I was not absent from the basket above two or three minutes; I saw the prisoner at the bar take it out of the basket; I pursued him immediately; I never lost fight of him, except turning the corner; I took him within two minutes with the loaf upon him; I know it to be my master's loaf by the mark upon it.
I heard a cry of stop thief; I took this loaf from the prisoner, (producing it)
This is the loaf, it has my mark upon it.
I bought the loaf.
