I live in King-street, Tower Hill ; I keep a clothe's shop , the prisoner is a sailor ; two of his shipmates lodged with me; he came by their desire to my house in May; he was to stay till he could get a ship; I took him in out of kindness, and he staid till Oct. 4th; in the afternoon of that day he told me he had got a birth on board a sloop, and was going away either that evening or the next morning; I went out, and returned about eight o'clock; the prisoner was gone; I had seen the coat and waistcoat that day in the one pair of stairs back room; I missed them next morning; I saw no more of him till the 18th; before the justice he confessed it; he was taken on the 17th of October; as I was coming from the justice's I saw my waistcoat hanging up at the door of a clothe's shop, I went in and desired the woman to shew me the waistcoat; her husband is here; it is the same waistcoat I lost; then I asked her if she could shew me a coat, she did, and the handkerchief was produced before the justice, it was marked I. B.
I live at No. 60, Rosemary Lane; I am a salesman; I produce the property which I bought of the prisoner, either the 4th or 5th of October; I am sure he is the man of whom I bought them; he came in and asked me 18 s. for all the things; I agreed for 17 s. I asked him how he came by them; he said they were made for him when he came home from sea; I thought the coat was not his size; he offered to try them on; I said, there is no occasion if they are your own.
I had been among my shipmates, and was in liquor.
