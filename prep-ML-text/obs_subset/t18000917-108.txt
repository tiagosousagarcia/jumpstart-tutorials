I am servant to Mr. Robert Howard , at Stamford-hill : On the 30th of August, I found the hen-house broke open, and a dozen of fowls missing; I missed them before seven o'clock in the morning, there were two of them found in a tub in the house where this man lodged.
I am a labouring man, and live at Newington; I found these two fowls in a water-tub, where the prisoner slept, he said, he had put them there for his own use, and the remainder of the fowls he had thrown away; because lie would not to be taken with them upon him.
I am sure these are Mr. Howard's fowls.
I have got two witnesses to prove that Laythorp offered to lay a wager that he would transport me, or hang me.
His laying that wager will not make you innocent.
