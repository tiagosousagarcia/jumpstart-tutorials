I live at Mr. Weldale's, linen-draper , in Oxford-street , as his servant: a gipsey woman came to ask me if I wanted my fortune told; she came on a Tuesday morning as I was taking the bread in at the door; I asked her what she would have for it, she said, sixpence; I told her I had not time then, but to come the next morning; she came the next morning about eight o'clock, and knocked at the door; I let her in, and took her down into the kitchen; she told me to put a bit of silver in my hand, and I put a shilling in my hand; and she said, would I give it her, I said, yes; she said, she must go for ten minutes, to do something to the planets; I was to tie ten pieces of gold up in a handkerchief; I said, I had not ten pieces of gold, and she said, I must tie up ten pieces of silver; then I tied up ten silver spoons, and she went away, and I saw no more of her; the spoons were my master's; they were in my charge; she went away with spoons, handkerchief and all; I am very sure the prisoner is the woman.
On Saturday the 28th of December, I had the prisoner in custody, and having heard of this affair before, I went to Mr. Weldale's, and desired the young woman to come down, to see if she knew her, and as soon as she saw her, she immediately said, that was the woman that had taken ten pieces of silver from her.
I was with Treadway when he apprehended the prisoner, and I had her in custody, while Treadway went for the young woman; when she came in, she knew her directly.
I never saw the young woman in my life, till I saw her at Bow-street; I get my bread by hard work; I never was brought up to fortune-telling in my life; I go a harvesting, hay-making, and hopping in the summer, and in winter, in making mats, and carrying them about, with\\ to\\ asting-forks and meat-stands.
