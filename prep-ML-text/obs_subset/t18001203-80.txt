My husband and I live at Kentish Town , the prisoner was our servant of all work; I missed the property on Tuesday, the 2d of December, I saw the guineas on the Saturday before; the prisoner wished to be discharged from my service abruptly, on Tuesday, the 2d; I paid her, and she took an old leather purse from her pocket, and dropped half-a-guinea into it, and by dropping it, it seemed to drop among other gold; I had no reason to suppose that she was possessed of a great deal, and as she seemed to be in a very great hurry to get out of the house, I went up stairs into my bed-room, and opened a drawer, to see whether my money was safe; I found a number of guineas gone from the bag; the drawer was always kept locked, and I had the key in my pocket, with which I opened the drawer, and which opened as easy as ever; on taking the drawer down, I missed a number of guineas and the five-guinea-piece; I did not wait to examine any other property, but immediately set off to town after the prisoner; in James-street2, Covent-garden, I found the coachman who drove her, and he told me she took a coach and went to the Golden-cross; I went there and heard of her, that she had taken a place to go off by the Birmingham coach at seven o'clock the next morning; I went the next morning, and was sitting in a coach in the street, when she was taken up at the Golden-cross, Charing-cross; she was taken to a public-house and searched; I saw her trunk and her person searched the same day, there was nothing in the trunk belonging to me; I was desired by the officer to take her into a back room, to search her myself; I caused her to take her clothes off, and I found a bag, containing the five-guinea piece, two-guinea piece, the two five-and-threepences, two guineas and a half in gold, a half-crown piece, and a silver threepence; I cannot swear to the guineas, the five-guinea piece I can, and I think I can to the two-guinea piece and the five-and-threepences; I cannot swear to the guineas or silver.
I am an officer, and took the prisoner into custody.
How did she carry this bag; was it sewn to her stays, or how?
It was not sewed at all; it dropped from her person or clothes. (The money produced).
I know nothing at all about it.
