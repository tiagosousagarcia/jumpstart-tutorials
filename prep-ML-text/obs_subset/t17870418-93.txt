I am shopman to a linen-draper; on the 9th of March, about seven, the prisoner came to our shop, and asked for a piece of cloth; I sold her a piece, and she gave me five shillings, and half a crown; I found them all bad, and I asked her if she had no more; then she produced three shillings more; they were also bad; I ran to my master, and I immediately called her back; I called a constable, but before a constable came, she had something in her mouth, and we told her to put it out, which she did; she put five or six shillings out of her mouth, and she said, mind, I do not offer these; the constable found nothing more on her, only a few bad halfpence. (The half crown produced, and the shillings.) These are all bad.
I took them for good; I thought they were good; I went to buy some shirts for my little boy; I cannot swear positively to them.
I have known her fifteen years; I lived next door to her; she had a house full of lodgers, since which she has dealt in Rag Fair.
