I am in the employ of Messrs. Spode, the prisoner was a servant also: On Saturday, the 17th of January, I suspected he had something in his pocket; I communicated the same to Mr. Spode; the prisoner went out and I followed him and overtook him on Blackfriars-bridge, with a crate on his back, which had been given him; I passed him and hit his pocket; I found something in it; I then requested him to go back; I told him Mr. Spode wanted to speak with him; he asked me what Mr. Spode wanted with him; I told him I did not know; when we came back we met Mr. Spode in the back room; he asked him what he had got in his pocket; he said, nothing; after that he pulled out a mug, and then he pulled out two more mugs (the mugs produced) ; they are Staffordshire ware; I know them to be Messrs. Spode's manufactory; they are worth 6 s. the three; he said it was the first time, and hoped it would be looked over.
I am one of the Officers belonging to Bow-street: I went to the lodgings of the prisoner, at Narrow-wall, Lambeth, and found all these articles, the remainder in the indictment.
