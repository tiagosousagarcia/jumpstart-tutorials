- I am a watchmaker , No. 119, New Bond-street , in partnership with John Allam : the prisoner was our shopman about ten months; he was entrusted with a metal time-keeper to set clocks by; I saw it in his possession on the 18th of July, and on the 21st; I told him I should not want him any longer than Saturday night, in consequence of suspicions that I entertained; this was on Thursday, and he did not return any more; I went in search of him, and apprehended him on the Saturday following at a public-house, the end of Rosoman's-street, Clerkenwell; he came about a quarter of a mile with me, and refused to go any further; he then turned back, and I followed him till I found an opportunity of getting assistance, and then he ran away; I cried stop thief, and he cried stop thief till we got into Coppice-row, and then I secured him, and took him to Bow-street; the pawnbroker is here with the property.
You have another watch in your possession belonging to the prisoner?
I do not know that it is belonging to him.
There is a little account between you - a balance of wages, is there not?
He is considerably in my debt; the duplicate of the watch was sent to my house by the post, in a letter, after the prisoner was apprehended; it was pledged in his own name.
I am servant to Moore and Grimwood, pawnbrokers, in Bird-street, Manchester-square: On the 19th of July, the prisoner pledged a metal watch at our house for three guineas; I was present.
When my master gave me this watch, I considered it as my own property.
I never gave it to him for any other purpose than to regulate clocks; it was made for that purpose.
