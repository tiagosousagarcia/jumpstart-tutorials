- I am the wife of the prosecutor, No. 146, Oxford-street ; The prisoner came to live with me two days before I lost the property: On the 8th of September, she asked leave to go out at seven o'clock in the evening; I told her she should, if her master was home in time; a customer came into the shop, and I went next door to get change of a one pound note; I left her in the parlour, and two errand boys in the shop with the customer, I was absent three or four minutes; when I came back, she was in the parlour, I suspected she had something in her pockets, as they stuck out very much, and insisted upon searching her; I found in each pocket a pair of jean slippers, and I sent for a constable; she said, she picked them up in the shop.
Did you receive any character with her?
Yes, I had a very good character with her - a nine months character.
I have neither father nor mother, nor any creature in the world to speak for me; I lived with my mistress a week.
