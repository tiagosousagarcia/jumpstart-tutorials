You live with Mr. Thwaites, in Holborn .
I do, he is a linen draper . From information, I missed nine cotton handkerchiefs from the door, on Thursday the 15th of January, about three o'clock. I hung them at the door a quarter of an hour before.
Do you know that they were not sold.
They were not; I pursued her, she dropped down on the pavement just by White-hart court; whether it was for concealing the goods or by accident I cannot say; when she saw me she jumped up and ran away. I caught her with the goods upon her, and when I caught her she threw the goods about a yard and a half from her. I took her down to my employer. Mr. Thwaites ordered me to take her to Hatton Garden.
I am a single man, I lodge at the Broad Arrow, Grub street, I am a smith
Were you in Holborn on Thursday last.
I was, about three o'clock. I saw the prisoner fumbling about the handkerchiefs at Mr. Thwaites' door, she unpinned the tickets from the handkerchiefs; I was across the way, I had suspicion that she was going to take them, she rolled them up in a bundle; then she put them at the back of some more linen that was at the door; she stopped about a minute and a half, till the people passed, until she had an opportunity of taking them; then she put them under her blue apron, crossed the way, and went up White Hart court. I came over and acquainted Mr. Thwaites of it, and I saw her taken.
Did you see the bundle then.
Yes, it was rolled up.
I know no more of it than you do at this moment; I was very much in liquor when this gentleman laid hold of me. I have got this child, and I work very hard for my living.
