I am a widow, and live at Stoke Newington : I had missed the desert-spoon about a month, and the fork about five or six weeks before I saw them at Worship-street, which was about the 24th or 26th of December; the prisoner was my gardener , he lived in a cottage on the premises; he was in my service when he was taken up; I had no suspicion of him till I was sent for to identify him.
I am a pawnbroker, at No. 8, Old-street-road: On the 21st of December, the prisoner came to our shop, and offered a silver fork, a silver desert-spoon, and a silver pencil-case; I asked him how he came by them; he told me his fellow-servant gave it to him to sell for him, and that he lived with a lady, of the name of Agar, at Walthamstow; the fork was broke, and it appeared to have been done wilfully, and not by accident; I had a suspicion he had not come honestly by them, and I detained him.
On the 21st of December, I was sent for to Mr. Hall's shop to take the prisoner into custody; the articles were then on the counter; I said to the prisoner, where did you have these things from? the tea-spoon, he said, he found in the garden; the fork, he said, he had from one John, that lived with Mrs. Agar, at Walthamstow, a fellow-servant of his; the prisoner was committed, and I found out Mrs. Robley's house, and she came and identified the prisoner and the fork.
The fork has the letter R upon it, I have no doubt of its being mine.
I have nothing to say.
He has been with me three years, and I never suspected him of any thing of that kind.
