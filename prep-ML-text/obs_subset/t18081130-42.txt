You are housekeeper to Francis De Roufigney
Yes; he lives in Castle street, Holborn , he keeps a French establishment for the education of youth .
Do you know the prisoner at the bar
Yes, very well, she was first employed as chairwoman and afterwards as a washerwoman .
Had Mr. De Roufigney any carpet
Yes; it was taken up stairs in the room where the servant slept about a year ago, I saw it there and opened it; about a month ago, I dare say, I missed it. The prisoner's house was searched, I was present at the time; the prisoner was at home; she lived in Plough court, Fetter lane. We found in her lodgings some shirts, stockings, night caps, handkerchiefs, a pencil case, and a cork screw.
Did you know to whom they respectively belonged
Yes. They had all been in our house; I remember the time they were missing; I many times enquired of the prisoner respecting them; she said she did not know any thing of them, nor could she think what had become of them, it was very strange, she said.
Among the other articles was these a shirt belonging to Mr. Stoll
Yes.
Did the prisoner wash for Mr. Stoll
No. I enquired of her three months ago if she had any such shirt; she said no.
Mr. Roufigney keeps a pretty large school in Castle street
Yes.
And the prisoner washed for him - at what time did you make the search at the prisoner's house
It might be three weeks or a month ago.
There had been an unfortunate quarrel between Mr. Roufigney and Mrs. Penn just before you went to search the house
I do not know of a quarrel.
Now we will see whether you and I agree in the definition of a quarrel - do not you know that Mr. Roufigney owed her fifty or sixty pounds
I do not know.
Do not you know positively
Yes, he may.
And she did not get her money - she threatened to arrest him
Yes; but I do not know that she found any difficulty in getting her money.
In point of fact, she did threaten to arrest him and he then paid her
Yes; she had no occasion of taking these means.
She could not get it without
No, that is not right.
Upon your oath had not she been applying week after week, and month after month
No.
However he has paid her
He has paid her with money that he has not received; he has been a great friend to the woman; she agreed to give credit.
Was not some of it two years standing
I believe some of it might.
In consequence of her demanding the money in this way Mr. Roufigney was not well pleased
He was not well pleased.
Was not he very ill pleased
He was not pleased certainly.
And certainly not being pleased was not he very angry, and said he would be even with her
No.
Perhaps that was too coarse English, he said it In French perhaps
I have heard him very angry.
Now how many days after his being very angry was it that you went to search her house
I dare say three weeks or a month.
So long as: that can you swear it was a fortnight
I cannot; I can swear it was a week.
You found some shirts; you found some things of Mr. Dowling's and Mr. Stoll; the cork screw who did that belong to
Mr. Turreneau.
Did not you find that in a box belonging to William, who formerly had lived in Mr. Roufigney's house
I do not know that.
You know you had a man of the name of William live with you
Yes.
Did not Mr. Roufigney tell you he knew that box in which the cork screw was found
He did not.
You was servant in the house of Mr. Roufigney
Yes.
Do you recollect a carpet belonging to one of the rooms being placed in your room
Yes; I was present when it was opened and part of it was missing; I saw a piece of it at Mrs. Penn's, it laid wrong side upwards; it was the same pattern as the carpet in Mr. Roufigney's house. I said nothing to Mrs. Penn; the first time I saw it in her room; when I went the second time I found the carpet there again.
When was it you went the first time
It was two or three days before she was taken up; the second time was the day after; I then said to Mrs. Penn, Mrs. Guy sent me to see if I should know this carpet; she said this is not your carpet; I said it is Mr. Roufigney's there has been a great noise made about it, and there will be more; she told me to tell Mrs. Guy that I did not know the carpet.
Did you in point of fact know the carpet
Yes; there was another piece of carpet laid by the door, of a different pattern; she told me to tell Mrs. Guy it was not hers.
I am an officer of Hatton garden. On the 2nd of November, I searced Mrs. Penn's room; Mrs. Guy and the last witness was with me; upon searching the house I found five shirts, a white waistcoat, and a pair of silk stockings, one cotton stocking, two pocket handkerchiefs, and a silver pencil case, these things were all in the drawers, the drawer was locked; she opened them herself very willingly; I found other articles, but they were not sworn to.
Tell me what you found
This handkerchief and a cork screw I found in a box locked; there was no key. I broke it open; Mrs. Guy and Mr. Roufigney attended me, they said it was a box that belonged to William, and they knew his linen in it.
