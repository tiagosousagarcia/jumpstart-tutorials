I live at Muswell hill ; on the 6th of this month, before I came to town I sent a man up into a dwelling place in my garden to fetch some cloaths, he said there was none, afterwards I heard the prisoner was selling a coat, which I understood to be my property; on Monday I looked, and my things were gone, they were there the Saturday before; at three in the afternoon the prisoner was taken into custody, and he confessed the fact directly in my hearing at the Cooper's Arms at Highgate, and said that he took all the cloaths, and two coats that a man that was concerned with him ran away with.
Did you make use of any promises to induce him to confess?
I did not; I got some of my things again, all but the two coats; through the constable.
On the Monday, the 7th of this month, between eight and nine, I was sent for to the Cooper's-arms; there was the prosecutor and the prisoner, and three or four more, the prisoner denied the robbery; but a person came in and said a pair of black sattin breeches was sold this morning, at the Fox and Crown: I advised the prisoner to tell us where they were, to save trouble; says he, I lodged at Mrs. Roger's last night, and some of it is there; I went there and found two pair of nankeen breeches, and a white waistcoat and a black one. She said she sold the black sattin breeches for the prisoner, to the man at the Fox and crown, and that the other man ran away with the two coats. The prisoner confessed taking these things.
