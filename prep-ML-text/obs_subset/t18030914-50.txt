I am servant to Playfair and James, trunk-maker s, No. 14, the corner of Clifford-street, New Bond-street : On the 10th of May the trunk was stolen from the shop door; on the 16th of May I saw the trunk at Mr. Stevens's, a broker's door, in Mary-le-Bone-lane; I told my master.
I am a broker in Mary-le-Bone-lane; the prisoner brought the trunk to me the beginning of May, about nine days before it was owned; I paid for it; I gave nine shillings for it; he said he was out of employ.
I saw a man take a trunk from Mr. Playfair's door, but cannot swear to the prisoner.
I deny stealing the trunk; I sold a trunk to Mr. Stevens, which I bought of a fellow-servant; I have been in his Majesty's service, and bought it of my fellow-servant, who told me he was going to sell it.
