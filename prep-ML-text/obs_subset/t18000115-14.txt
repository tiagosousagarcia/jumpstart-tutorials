I am clerk to Mr. Thomas Bolt; I had the care of Fresh Wharf ; On the 23d of December, about four o'clock in the evening, we had just left off landing, when I detected this man with a quantity of sugar in his hat; I saw him with his hands at work in the sugar, and I watched him; he took it out of a hogshead that laid upon the whars, and put it in his hat, and then on his head; I delivered the sugar and the prisoner to the constable.
I am a watchman upon the quays; I was called to by Mr. Wilson to take charge of the prisoner; I saw the sugar in his hat; I gave charge of him to the constable, and the sugar was delivered over to him.
He behaved in a very resolute manner, we were obliged to bind him in a cart to take him to the Compter.
This is the same fort of sugar that was in the hogshead.
I did not take it out of the hogshead; I had been at work for Mr. Wilson in the crane; there had been some soldiers at work upon the ground, and they had every one taken some out, and I was gathering what they had scattered upon the ground, when Mr. Wilson came up and laid hold of me.
