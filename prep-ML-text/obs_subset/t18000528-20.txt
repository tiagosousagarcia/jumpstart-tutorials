I am a labourer in the India Company's warehouses; the prisoner is a labourer in the same warehouse in Crutched-friars : On Friday, the 16th of May last, while I was eating my breakfast in one of the alleys in the warehouse, the prisoner came down within three yards of where I was; he unpapered a chest of a tea which had just been papered for nailing up to be weighed; he took out several hands full, and concealed it in his great coat pocket; as soon as he had done he left the place; he could not see me at that time; he then quitted the alley as quick as he possibly could.
The alleys are the spaces between the chests?
Yes; I then followed him in to the yard; he took his breakfast from the publican; I then acquainted Mr. Barber, the elder, with what I had seen; the next time I saw the prisoner was in Mr. Coward's accompting-house; I saw some tea in a bag in the officer's hands.
I am assistant elder: In consequence of information from the last witness, I went in search of the prisoner; I found him sitting upon a congou chest; eating his breakfast; I said to him, Rainsley, I want you below stairs; I took him down into Mr. Coward's accompting-house; he is the chief elder; I acquaited him of it, and I procured a Custom-house officer and had him searched; in his great-coat pocket was a bag of tea containing nine ounces; I saw it taken out of his pocket by the Custom-house officer; he seemed a good deal confused; I procured a constable and took him over to Mr. Stockwell, the wasrehouse-keeper, and there he went down upon his knees, and begged for mercy.
Had you promised him forgiveness if he would say any thing about it?
No, I had not.
I am guilty of this offence; I hope your Lordship will suffer me to go to sea.
I am an officer of the Customs: I took this tea out of the prisoner's pocket; (produces it;) it is worth one shilling and three-pence.
