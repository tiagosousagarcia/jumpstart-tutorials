I am wife of Thomas Fortener , I lost a sheet out of a box at my own room, I saw it a week before, I found it upon the prisoner, she was a lodger, she lodged in the first floor; I found it the 12th of this month; I lost a great many things before I had a suspicion of it, and I went down to acquaint the landlord of it, and I see her go out with something under her cloak; my son followed her, and Francis Largly .
How old is the prisoner, do you know?
Twenty-seven years of age.
I pursued the prisoner at the bar by my own choice last Monday was a week, the 12th, and I found this sheet upon her, about eleven o'clock in the morning.
It is my own sheet, I bought it of a woman that goes about the street, selling shirts, sheets, and any thing; I had bought it about three weeks.
