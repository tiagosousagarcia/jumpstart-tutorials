I live in the garrison, in the Tower ; I am an invalid ; I know nothing of the loss myself.
I am the wife of John Yarwood; he prisoner was an acquaintance of a man in the garrison; I left her in my room on Monday, the 30th of April, about 12 o'clock in the day, I lost a shirt and a shift; I did not see them again till the 3d of this month, when I saw them at the office, in Lambeth-street, in the hands of two pawnbrokers.
I live with my mother, a pawnbroker, in Wentworth-street, Whitechapel: On the 1st of May, the prisoner pawned a shirt with me for three shillings and sixpence. (Produces it.) I had known her for some time before.
I am servant to Mr. Ray, a pawnbroker, Sparrow-corner, Minories: On the 30th of April, I took in a shift from the prisoner at the bar; I do not recollect to have seen her before; to the best of my knowledge she is the person.
I am a patrole of Whitechapel, I was going along Essex-street, Whitechapel, Mr. Yarwood asked me to assist him in apprehending this woman, and we took her, it was the 3d of this month; she gave me the duplicate of the shirt, she said she had lost the other.
Had you threatened her, or told her it would be better for her?
Yes, I told her it would be better for her to give them up. (Produces the duplicate.)
This is the counterpart of our duplicate.
I hope the Court will be favourable, I took them through distress.
