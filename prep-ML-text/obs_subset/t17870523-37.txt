I live at the King's-head, in Love-lane, Thames-street ; on the 9th of May, I was going to start some liquor; I found the cup where I put some money in there, was missing; about eighteen or nineteen shillings out of a cupboard; in the parlour was the cupboard; I locked it; I turned the key in it and I thought it was locked; it appeared to me in the morning to have been picked; I put the key in it and the door was open.
Did you miss the farthing?
No, I did not miss a farthing, I put the money into the cup just before I went to bed; when I missed the money, the prisoner came into the tap-room; he lodged in my house; he called for a penny-worth of purl; I asked him if Wenham was up; he said, yes; he was gone to Billinsgate, to attend the mackarel carts; I sent for him and told him I had been robbed; then says he, send for a constable and every one shall be searched; while some person was gone for the constable, some person threw some money under the table; I heard some money fall; there were eight or ten people in the room; they were sitting in a settle in the tap-room.
How came the farthing in the indictment?
I do not know, only the farthing was picked up with the silver and half-pence off the ground.
I am a box-maker; I happened to be in the house; I know nothing of the matter; I only heard the money fall.
I was in the house at the time the money fell; I was a lodger in the house; I only heard the money fall, but know not from whence.
