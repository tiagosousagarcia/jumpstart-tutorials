I live at Lampton-hill near Hounslow ; I lost the things in the indictment, they were taken from the hedge on the Heath, the witness took the prisoner on suspicion and brought her to my house with the property; I had not found out the things were gone before the prisoner was brought back, she brought back the things with her with the witness, the prisoner told the witness she would bring them to the place where she took them from; they where given into the constable's hands, the justice delivered them to the constable; I carried them in my cart with the prisoner to the justice.
The linen was hung out about seven or eight o'clock, when she brought them back to our place they were wet; we did not miss them till they were brought back? I am sure it is our linen.
I am a constable. Samuel Pearce brought the prisoner to me, and I conveyed her to the magistrate, where she was committed, and I there got the custody of the linen, and have kept it till this moment.
Edward Deer and I were going from Brentford to Hounslow, and in the road we met this prisoner at the bar offering this wet linen for sale, and we took her up on suspicion, and before she went a quarter of a mile with us she confessed where she had taken the linen from; we then went to the man's house, and he took her down to the constable, and we went before the justice.
I was present with John Rule between Brentford and Hounslow, in the parish of New Brentford, we were coming from Brentford to Hounslow, and saw this girl offering this wet linen for sale, we took her up on suspicion, and before she was a quarter of a mile she said she took them off the common.
As I was coming along the common I saw the linen laying on the ground, and I picked it up, they were hanging out to dry.
