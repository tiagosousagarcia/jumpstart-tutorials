I am a silver spoon maker ; I had the prisoner upon liking.
What age is he
Fifteen. On Monday the 18th of December I missed a piece of silver, about an ounce and an half, I told him I had missed a piece of silver and set him to look for it; he could not find it In the evening I taxed him with it, he said he had taken a little lump, he had throwed it away; afterwards he acknowledged to taking the piece that I missed; he said he sold it to Grimshaw, 17, Gee-street, for two shillings; I went to Gee-street, there was no such person lived there; and then afterwards he denied having taken any, only these three bits that we found hid under a board in the washhouse.
You told him it would be better to confess
I did. I never missed the three pieces hid under the board in the washhouse.
I suppose you cannot swear to these three pieces
No, I cannot.
