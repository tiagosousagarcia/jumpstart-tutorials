I live in Goodman's-yard . On the 8th of August, I lost three shirts, which I had left in my room when I went out to work at six in the morning. When I came back between four and five in the afternoon I missed them; I saw the prisoner in the street when I came back, and found the things upon the ground near Mr. Russell's passage gate.
I lodged in the same room with the last witness. I lost a pair of shoes and buckles from the same room at the same time. I found them under the gate between three and four o'clock.
I lodged in the same room; I lost my property, which I found under the gate.
I keep this house. The three men lodge with me. On the 8th of August in the afternoon, while I was in the kitchen I heard a noise; I stepped forward and saw the prisoner go out of my house; I followed her to Russel's gate-way, which is not many yards off; just at the moment I came up to her she threw the things down.
I am a constable. I found these things under the gateway.
I was coming past the place; that woman said I had the things; I never saw her before.
