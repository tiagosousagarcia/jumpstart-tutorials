sworn - I am a Jew , and live at No. 19, Bury-street, St. Mary-Axe : The prisoner was my servant about a fortnight, and I missed all the articles except two spoons; on Thursday the 20th of May, about seven o'clock in the morning, I was alarmed; I got up, and told the prisoner it would be better for her to confess; she was taken into custody, and committed.
I am servant to Mr. Maxey, a pawnbroker, in Ratcliff-highway: I produce a pair of buckles, and a pair of table-spoons, which were pawned together by the prisoner, on the 20th of May; I knew her before, and lent her fourteen shillings on them.
I am a constable, and took the prisoner into custody: In consequence of her information, I found this plate (producing the articles mentioned in the indictment) behind a smallbeer barrel, in the cellar; she pulled a duplicate of the spoons out of her pocket, and gave it to me, and I got them.
