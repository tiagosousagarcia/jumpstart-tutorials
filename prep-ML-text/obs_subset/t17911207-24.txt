On Tuesday, the 29th of November, about the middle of Fleet-street , the prisoner at the bar snatched the things mentioned in the indictment from under my arm, and ran away; I pursued him, and saw him throw the parcel down; the prisoner never was out of my sight; I am quite clear that is the man.
I produce the goods; I have had them ever since.
The young woman was pursuing the prisoner; he threw a paper parcel away; I told her to pick it up; I pursued him and took him.
Please you my lord, I was coming up Fleet-street, and I saw a congregation of people assembled, and I went to see as another might do, and they took me up.
