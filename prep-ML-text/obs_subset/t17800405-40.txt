I am the wife of William Jorden . On the 17th of March, about nine in the evening, having occasion to go into the bed room up one pair of stairs, I found the door locked, I could not open it; one of the servants got a ladder and got in at the window, which was open; he found the key in the door in the inside of the room; he opened it. I went in and found the wardrobe stripped. The drawer of the wardrobe, in which some of the things were, was violently pulled open; several things were thrown about. There was the mark of a foot in the window seat, and two or three foot-marks on the floor. The things mentioned in the indictment (repeating them) were all missing.
I found these things in a pillow-case in Bagnall's room. Bagnall and the woman were both in the room at the time the woman claimed the things. Bagnall said nothing about them.
They are mine; I marked them myself.
I have my wife in court to prove I do not belong to the house.
Your wife cannot be a witness.
