- I am a linen-draper .
Have you any partners?
Yes, James Hutchinson ; we live at No. 5, Great Russel-street : On the 12th of December, the prisoner took the flannel from just the inside of the door of our shop; there were about twenty-three yards.
What time of the day?
Between four and five o'clock in the afternoon.
Did you see him take it?
I did not; I missed it, and immediately looked after it, and saw the prisoner with it under his arm; I immediately ran after him, and just as I was going to take hold of him, he dropped the flannel; I took hold of him and the flannel, and brought him and the flannel back to the shop.
Is that the flannel? (the flannel produced)
Yes.
How far was he from your shop?
About twenty yards.
I was walking along Russell-street with my hands in my pocket; I had nothing of the kind; that gentleman came after me, and said I had stole a piece of flannel from his shop; I know nothing of it; he swore at Bow-street Office he saw me take it.
