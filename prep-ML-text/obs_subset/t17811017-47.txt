I keep the sign of the King's-arms, in Golden-lane . On Tuesday, the 25th of September, the prisoner came to my house, and called for a pint of beer. When he was gone, we missed a pint pot off the seat where he had sat. I went out after him, and found him in the street, with my pot in his breeches.
I was in distress. I went to the parish, and they would give me only sixpence, to get me a lodging.
