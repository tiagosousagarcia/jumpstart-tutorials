- I am a carpenter ; I know nothing of the transaction.
On Wednesday the 8th of December, I was painting at the end of Mr. King's yard; I saw the prisoner take four deals from under the shop in the yard; I went after him, and stopped him about one hundred yards off; he said he did not take them from there; I took them from him, and gave charge of him to a constable.
(To King.) Were all the deals under your shop your property?
They were. From what I have known of the prisoner, I would take him into my service. GUILTY , aged 43.
