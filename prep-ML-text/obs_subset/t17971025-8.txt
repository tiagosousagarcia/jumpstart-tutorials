I am a grocer , in Broadway, Westminster . On Thursday last, at near eight o'clock in the morning, the prisoner came in for some tea and sugar; I had just been settling my money, and put it in the window on the ledge; I gave her change for a shilling, and she went away; I went into the back-room, I had not been there half a minute when I turned round and saw the prisoner going out again; I thought she had left something upon the counter, and I took no notice of that, and about ten minutes after I missed the purse: I had seen her many times before, she had asked me if I wanted any waistcoats made, that she worked for Mr. Hill, a pawnbroker; I went there and got her address, the constable was then in the street, and I took him with me, she was not at home, we waited about a quarter of an hour, when she came in, and I gave charge of her; she was searched in my back parlour, and in between her things the constable found the money; he cut the string and it fell from her, there was 2l. 5s. in silver, including a French half-crown, and two bad shillings; and eight guineas and a half in gold, and two Bank-notes.
I can swear to the Bank-notes, and two four-penny pieces that I had had a long time by me.
Two doors before I came to the prosecutor's house, I saw a dog with something in his mouth, I heard it chink, and I took it from him.
