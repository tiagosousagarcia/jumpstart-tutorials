I am shopman to Mr. Gibson, a linen-draper in Castle-street . On the 8th of July the prisoner came into the shop between nine and ten o'clock in the evening, and took the things mentioned in the indictment (repeating them) off the counter and ran out of the shop immediately. I was behind another counter. I pursued him directely; when he found he was pursued he threw them from off his shoulder.
Did you see him throw them from his shoulder?
Yes; I continued to pursue him and at last I secured him. When I took him he told me he was not the person I took him to be. I brought him back into the shop and left the things lying in the street. The other witness took them up, I never lost sight of him at all. I am sure the prisoner is the man who came out of the shop and threw the things off his shoulder.
What did he say when you brought him back to the shop?
Nothing at all.
I was at that time fellow-servant with the last witness. On the evening of the 8th of July I was standing at the back counter.
Did you see this man come in?
No, but I heard the last witness run out of the shop in a violent hurry. I followed him and found these goods lying in the middle of the street. I brought them in again; they have been in my custody every since.
I am as innocent as the child unborn. I was going by and heard the cry of stop thief! That gentleman catched hold of me. As to having the things or knowing any thing of them. I was never in the place, and I know nothing of them.
