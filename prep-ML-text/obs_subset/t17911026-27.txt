I am a perfumer , No. 10, King-street, Soho .
I am servant to the last witness, the articles in the indictment were taken from the shop in the morning about nine, that was Tuesday morning last; I heard a noise in the shop, saw the door open, went in, and missed the things in the indictment, I saw them in the shop that morning. The prisoner was taken in a few minutes; I pursued him, and saw him drop the linen; they were loose, I did not see him go out of the house, but I never lost sight of him after I once saw him. I am sure he is the man. The things were delivered to the officer.
I took these things taken from the servant, I did not see them on the prisoner; the young woman was picking them up.
I am an officer, I run first and took the boy ; I did not see the articles upon him.
A young man offered me sixpence to carry them.
