- I am a butcher, No. 21, Fullwood's-rents, Holborn : I employed Mrs. Barry to paint my house; the prisoner was employed by her as a painter ; while sitting in my kitchen after dinner, I saw the prisoner go up into the first-floor, I saw him come down with a paintpot, and heard him pour something off upon the leads, he then took the pot and went out of the house; the apprentice came in just after, and complained of its being lost; the prisoner said, he knew nothing of it, and I immediately taxed him with it.
I am an apprentice to Mrs. Barry; on the 9th of August, I delivered about three parts of a pot full of white-lead to the prisoner, to go to Mr. Campion's; I followed him a short time after, and he went away to dinner, and came back no more that day; I worked there the remainder of the day, and put the things away at night; I poured some water upon the white-lead; the next morning I sent him to another job, in Lamb's-conduit-street, he was to call at Mr. Campion's; I went with him to the other job, I was to work there till breakfast-time; I left him as much work as I thought would take him till about dinner-time; after dinner, I went to Mr. Campion's, and the lead was gone.
I am servant at the Blueposts, Fullwood's-rents; on Wednesday, I think, the 10th of August, the prisoner dined at the house, and after he had dined, a man came in, and they talked about painting, and the man said, he must buy some paint, to paint a house that he was doing of a night; the prisoner said, I will fetch you some, which he did; he asked him what he should give him for it, and he said, they should not fall out about that; then he said, he should want some oil, and he said, he would go and fetch some; the apprentice came in and asked the prisoner where the colour was, and he said it was up in the room; he went away and came back, and said, there was none there.
I went to have a pint of beer, and put the pint pot down in the passage, I don't know what became of it.
