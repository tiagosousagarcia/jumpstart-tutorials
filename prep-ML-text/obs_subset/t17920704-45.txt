I am widow of Joseph Ball , I was with him on the 28th of May last, we had been parted nine weeks, we did not agree; he turned me and child into the street several times; he lived in Half-moon-passage, No. 10, and I lived in Middlesex-passage; he came to my room about half past three, I was at home, we had made it up, and had taken a room; he asked me to take a walk; I went for his great coat, and Mr. Lowe was in the room; I had been absent about ten minutes, and I understood they had been falling out; my husband was leaning his hand on his head, he had complained of being not well two or three days before; the prisoner said he came for the money that was owing him, and my husband said he owed him nothing, and the prisoner swore he would have it out of his bones, and the prisoner struck him, and my husband struck him, and they had a round and fell, then they got up and had something to drink, and the prisoner poured out a glass of gin and threw it over me; then they drank and sat, and talked a good while; Lowe sent for some more gin, but neither of us tasted it; I got my husband out of the house, and the prisoner followed after my husband, and knocked him down in the Great Close; my husband said he was not hurt by the blows; we went to Islington, and returned in the evening: my husband said he was not well, and he took the bottle in his pocket to fetch something to drink; I went to bed, and the child came and said his father was fighting with Mr. Lowe; I went and brought him away, and he was all over mud and blood, and the people could not sleep all night for his groans; he seemed very bad; he told me to get a strengthening plaster: I fetched the doctor; he bled him, and made up a medicine; I got him a calf's foot, and made him some jelly, and got him some wine, and attended him all night, and next day he said he should die; I got him into the hospital, and he expired on the Sunday night. The prisoner and my husband were silk throwsters , and worked together.
I am a surgeon's pupil of Bartholomew's hospital; the deceased was brought there on Wednesday the 30th of May; he remained till the Sunday night; when he came in he complained of his side; I found four of his ribs broke, I applied bandages and the usual medicines; on Sunday night he died; his death was occasioned by an inflammation, in consequence of the broken ribs.
I saw the deceased on Whit-Monday between four and five in the evening, and the prisoner came in and there was a word or two arose about family affairs, and they fought about ten minutes; I believe it was a fit of jealousy; they fought in the taproom ten minutes, and then they agreed to go out to fight, and fought about six minutes in the yard; then it was all over; they were down three or four times, and I believe the damage was done against the table.
Did they fight fairly?
It was no fight, only pulling and hawling, and striking as they could, both of them as much as the other; the deceased went home to his own lodging; they did not live together; I saw him the next day; they were to have fought two or three weeks before, and the prisoner would not come.
