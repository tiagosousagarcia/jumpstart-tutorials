I am an apprentice to John Thwaites , linen-draper , 306. Holborn ; I saw the prisoner come into the shop, snatch the shawls off the place and run away, I immediately went after her, I asked what she had taken, she said nothing; I brought her back and took the shawls from under her coat. These are the shawls, I know them to be my master's.
I was going by, there was a man and a woman standing at the door where they had dropped down, he asked me what I had taken, I said I did not know; I told him I picked this up, if they were his I would give them him; I gave them him and he dragged me in the shop.
They were in the shop, she stepped in and snatched them off the iron.
